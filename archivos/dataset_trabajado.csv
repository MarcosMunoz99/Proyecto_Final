0,BIOREMEDIATION OF SULFATE IN WATER ENVIRONMENT: AN OVERVIEW OF REMOVAL PATHWAYS AND INFLUENCING FACTORS,Article,Yadav G.S.; Ghosh P.K.,Journal of Solid Waste Technology and Management,50.0,2024,430,440,10.5276/JSWTM/ISWMAW/501/2024.430,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193721562&doi=10.5276%2fJSWTM%2fISWMAW%2f501%2f2024.430&partnerID=40&md5=ba2822a0c5a77fe4f067adb5c2e8d15d,10881697,Scopus,Acid mine drainage; Biological treatment; Carbon source; Sulfate reducing bacteria; Sulfide toxicity,"Sulfate-laden wastewater generated from various natural and industrial activities, including mining, metallurgy, electroplating, and battery manufacturing and recycling, has the potential to contaminate both ground and surface water bodies. It is harmful to all forms of life and the environment. Thus, developing an efficient treatment system to address sulfate pollution is necessary. Biological sulfate reduction (BSR) involving sulfate-reducing bacteria offers a better removal of sulfate than conventional physicochemical methods. BSR offers various advantageous such as lower sludge production, removal and recovery of metals, and production of elemental sulfur. However, the performance of bioreactors depends on wastewater sources, microbes involved, and operating conditions. Currently, limited studies are available encapsulating the current state of the art of biological sulfate remediation aimed at optimization of bioreactor design and operation. Therefore, this paper attempts to provide a comprehensive review of the sources of sulfate, its health and ecological effects, microbes involved in sulfate reduction, and its removal pathways that would be beneficial for future bioreactor design. In addition, theoretical and practical aspects of influencing factors have been discussed. Considering the results of the reviewed articles, operating, and set-up conditions are recommended to obtain the higher sulfate removal. It includes dissimilatory sulfate reduction by mixed bacterial culture using sodium lactate as an electron donor with pH near about neutral, mesophilic conditions, [Formula presented] ratio of 0.67-1.7, ORP less than -100 mV, and lesser sulfide concentration. This overview helps to develop an effective strategy for bioremediation of sulfate and decreasing the sulfate-rich industrial effluent footprint. © 2024 Widener University School of Civil Engineering.

1,Combining slow-release fertilizer and plastic film mulching reduced the carbon footprint and enhanced maize yield on the Loess Plateau,Article,Han X.; Dang P.; Liao L.; Song F.; Zhang M.; Zhang M.; Li G.; Wen S.; Yang N.; Pan X.; Wang X.; Wang W.; Qin X.; Joseph C.O.; Siddique K.H.M.,Journal of Environmental Sciences (China),147.0,2025,359,369,10.1016/j.jes.2023.12.001,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184138972&doi=10.1016%2fj.jes.2023.12.001&partnerID=40&md5=5952b1e62baa281b2785e10ef420ca1c,10010742,Scopus,Carbon footprint; Economic benefits; Maize grain yield; Plastic film mulching; Slow-release fertilizer,"Agricultural practices significantly contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, necessitating cleaner production technologies to reduce environmental pressure and achieve sustainable maize production. Plastic film mulching is commonly used in the Loess Plateau region. Incorporating slow-release fertilizers as a replacement for urea within this practice can reduce nitrogen losses and enhance crop productivity. Combining these techniques represents a novel agricultural approach in semi-arid areas. However, the impact of this integration on soil carbon storage (SOCS), carbon footprint (CF), and economic benefits has received limited research attention. Therefore, we conducted an eight-year study (2015–2022) in the semi-arid northwestern region to quantify the effects of four treatments [urea supplied without plastic film mulching (CK-U), slow-release fertilizer supplied without plastic film mulching (CK-S), urea supplied with plastic film mulching (PM-U), and slow-release fertilizer supplied with plastic film mulching (PM-S)] on soil fertility, economic and environmental benefits. The results revealed that nitrogen fertilizer was the primary contributor to total GHG emissions (≥71.97%). Compared to other treatments, PM-S increased average grain yield by 12.01%–37.89%, water use efficiency by 9.19%–23.33%, nitrogen accumulation by 27.07%–66.19%, and net return by 6.21%–29.57%. Furthermore, PM-S decreased CF by 12.87%–44.31% and CF per net return by 14.25%–41.16%. After eight years, PM-S increased SOCS (0–40 cm) by 2.46%, while PM-U decreased it by 7.09%. These findings highlight the positive effects of PM-S on surface soil fertility, economic gains, and environmental benefits in spring maize production on the Loess Plateau, underscoring its potential for widespread adoption and application. © 2023"
2,Carbon emissions in China's steel industry from a life cycle perspective: Carbon footprint insights,Article,Song X.; Du S.; Deng C.; Shen P.; Xie M.; Zhao C.; Chen C.; Liu X.,Journal of Environmental Sciences (China),148.0,2025,650,664,10.1016/j.jes.2023.04.027,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85169098473&doi=10.1016%2fj.jes.2023.04.027&partnerID=40&md5=c38fbd0dae6e3d9722a812296c87436b,10010742,Scopus,Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions; Carbon footprint; China; Iron and steel industry; Life cycle,"China is the most important steel producer in the world, and its steel industry is one of the most carbon-intensive industries in China. Consequently, research on carbon emissions from the steel industry is crucial for China to achieve carbon neutrality and meet its sustainable global development goals. We constructed a carbon dioxide (CO2) emission model for China's iron and steel industry from a life cycle perspective, conducted an empirical analysis based on data from 2019, and calculated the CO2 emissions of the industry throughout its life cycle. Key emission reduction factors were identified using sensitivity analysis. The results demonstrated that the CO2 emission intensity of the steel industry was 2.33 ton CO2/ton, and the production and manufacturing stages were the main sources of CO2 emissions, accounting for 89.84% of the total steel life-cycle emissions. Notably, fossil fuel combustion had the highest sensitivity to steel CO2 emissions, with a sensitivity coefficient of 0.68, reducing the amount of fossil fuel combustion by 20% and carbon emissions by 13.60%. The sensitivities of power structure optimization and scrap consumption were similar, while that of the transportation structure adjustment was the lowest, with a sensitivity coefficient of less than 0.1. Given the current strategic goals of peak carbon and carbon neutrality, it is in the best interest of the Chinese government to actively promote energy-saving and low-carbon technologies, increase the ratio of scrap steel to steelmaking, and build a new power system. © 2023"
3,Bioenergy recovery and carbon emissions benefits of short-term bio-thermophilic pretreatment on low organic sewage sludge anaerobic digestion: A pilot-scale study,Article,Wang H.; Fu X.; Huang H.; Shen D.; Fan D.; Zhu L.; Dai X.; Dong B.,Journal of Environmental Sciences (China),148.0,2025,321,335,10.1016/j.jes.2023.08.022,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184022157&doi=10.1016%2fj.jes.2023.08.022&partnerID=40&md5=904d0e1a3b5ceafdfa5431c2c5bea628,10010742,Scopus,Anaerobic digestion; Bio-thermophilic pretreatment; Carbon emissions; Molecular microbiology; Pilot scale; Sludge,"Sewage sludge in cities of Yangzi River Belt, China, generally exhibits a lower organic content and higher silt contentdue to leakage of drainage system, which caused low bioenergy recovery and carbon emission benefits in conventional anaerobic digestion (CAD). Therefore, this paper is on a pilot scale, a bio-thermophilic pretreatment anaerobic digestion (BTPAD) for low organic sludge (volatile solids (VS) of 4%) was operated with a long-term continuous flow of 200 days. The VS degradation rate and CH4 yield of BTPAD increased by 19.93% and 53.33%, respectively, compared to those of CAD. The analysis of organic compositions in sludge revealed that BTPAD mainly improved the hydrolysis of proteins in sludge. Further analysis of microbial community proportions by high-throughput sequencing revealed that the short-term bio-thermophilic pretreatment was enriched in Clostridiales, Coprothermobacter and Gelria, was capable of hydrolyzing acidified proteins, and provided more volatile fatty acid (VFA) for the subsequent reaction. Biome combined with fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis showed that the number of bacteria with high methanogenic capacity in BTPAD was much higher than that in CAD during the medium temperature digestion stage, indicating that short-term bio-thermophilic pretreatment could provide better methanogenic conditions for BTPAD. Furthermore, the greenhouse gas emission footprint analysis showed that short-term bio-thermophilic pretreatment could reduce the carbon emission of sludge anaerobic digestion system by 19.18%. © 2023"
4,"Sustainability evaluation of C3MR natural gas liquefaction process: Integrating life cycle analysis with Energy, Exergy, and economic aspects",Article,Hareem M.; Raza F.; Kazmi B.; Ghauri R.; Zafar K.; Ahmed H.; Taqvi S.A.A.; Naqvi M.,Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry,137.0,2024,619,636,10.1016/j.jiec.2024.05.041,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85194089665&doi=10.1016%2fj.jiec.2024.05.041&partnerID=40&md5=3f90d9598efd1a55c38898ac7b4356a0,1226086X,Scopus,LCA; Liquefaction; Natural gas; Process analysis; Propane-precooled process,"In a transition towards a clean energy future, natural gas serves as an interim fuel due to its lower emissions whereas the C3MR (propane pre-cooled mixed refrigerant process) is widely recognized for high efficiency and commercial scale application converting natural gas to LNG. Previously, numerous studies have been conducted to optimize the energy efficiency and performance of C3MR process but very little contribution has been made towards its sustainability analysis. To address this, a life cycle analysis approach is established to evaluate the carbon footprint of C3MR process. In order to showcase its link with energy consumption and put forward the groundwork of analyses, the research focuses on using simulation – assisted optimization to reduce the specific energy consumption (SEC) of C3MR process by optimizing design variables. The study highlights the use of mixed refrigerant (MR) as a process variable and validates that its optimal implementation has decreased SEC to 0.2195 kWh/kg LNG, while achieving a minimum inlet temperature approach (MITA) of main cryogenic heat exchanger (MCHX), less than 3 °C. The knowledge − based optimization approach applied in this research, developed comparative case studies on which multiple analyses are performed to verify scientific findings. Energy and exergy analyses are conducted to determine thermal efficiency of the process where the optimized case exhibits a reduced difference in its composite curves and an 8.65 % improvement in exergetic performance compared to the base case. The economic indicators assessment reveals that optimized case demonstrates lower capital and operating costs, establishing economic viability. Furthermore, the energy consumption parameters are utilized for evaluation of ecological impact of LNG supply chain through life cycle assessment (LCA) which reflects reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for optimized case. Hence, the current study fills existing research knowledge gaps in terms of providing a comprehensive process system engineering by evaluating energy synergistic point, thermodynamic irreversibility, process viability and sustainability using life cycle assessment. © 2024 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry"
5,The effect of dietary changes on the water and carbon footprints in China,Article,Wang J.; Yin Y.; Sun S.; Zhao J.; Tang Y.; Wang Y.; Wu P.,Sustainable Production and Consumption,49.0,2024,276,288,10.1016/j.spc.2024.06.028,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197402030&doi=10.1016%2fj.spc.2024.06.028&partnerID=40&md5=8fe086b950f508b3d0c5ce0dcf0755f1,23525509,Scopus,Carbon footprint; Dietary change; Environmental sustainability; Human health; Life cycle assessment; Water footprint assessment,"Dietary changes impact the production and consumption of plant and animal foods, thereby affecting water resource usage and greenhouse gas emissions. However, previous studies have ignored subnational differences in long-term dietary changes and environmental impacts. This study evaluated the environmental impacts of dietary changes in China from 1997 to 2016 by combining water and carbon footprints. Results indicated significant provincial differences in both total food consumption amounts (277.15 Mt to 445.58 Mt) and patterns. At the national level, water consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of 10 main food items rose sharply from 437.52 ± 131.26 Gm3/yr to 671.13 ± 201.34 Gm3/yr and 273.66 ± 26.43 Mt CO₂ eq. to 443.50 ± 46.96 Mt CO₂ eq. As per capita animal-based food consumption first increased and then decreased, more developed regions with balanced diets showed water-saving and carbon reduction effects. For instance, Beijing reduced its water footprint by 50.44 m3/cap/yr and reduced carbon footprint by 186.05 kg CO₂ eq./cap/yr. In contrast, in less developed regions, animal food consumption has continued to grow over the last two decades, weighing the environmental impacts. Dietary changes in more developed regions can serve as references for less developed areas. Ensuring steady growth in animal food consumption for basic health needs can also support sustainable development. Furthermore, scenario analysis indicated that replacing all meat with plant-based food could achieve maximum water saving by 13 % and maximum emission reduction by 32 % with current energy and nutritional requirements, while towards national dietary guidelines would increase water consumption by 449.43 m3/cap and emissions by 8.48 CO2 eq./cap, dominated by increasing fruits and vegetables. Policies that affect consumers' choices of food patterns could focus more on promoting adequate and appropriate animal food intake towards healthy and environmentally friendly diets, particularly in less developed regions. © 2024 Institution of Chemical Engineers"
6,GREEN TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION AND PRICING DECISIONS CONSIDERING CARBON FOOTPRINT AND GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES,Article,Liu B.; Ma Y.; Zheng H.; Song Q.; Li K.,Journal of Industrial and Management Optimization,20.0,2024,3291,3316,10.3934/jimo.2024054,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197361744&doi=10.3934%2fjimo.2024054&partnerID=40&md5=b72e126c5ff64e19b1be94bb97267ae2,15475816,Scopus,Authorized remanufacturing; carbon footprint; government subsidies; green technology innovation,"We have developed three distinct decision models to examine the influence of consumer’s carbon footprint sensitivity level and government subsidies on the green technology innovation level of an original equipment manufacturer (OEM), as well as pricing decisions for both the OEM and a third-party remanufacturer (TPR). Our study provides valuable insights for businesses to determine the appropriate green technology innovation level and manage the adverse effects of carbon footprint. The results show that the OEM will set the green technology innovation level according to the consumer’s carbon footprint sensitivity level and the remanufacturing emission reduction coefficient. Only when there is government subsidy and the carbon footprint sensitivity level exceeds a certain threshold, does the profit of OEM increase with a rise in carbon footprint sensitivity level. Otherwise, the carbon footprint only harms the OEM’s profit. While the consumer’s carbon footprint sensitivity level can help reduce the detrimental environmental impact of products, it can also diminish consumer surplus and social welfare. However, government subsidies have the potential to mitigate the adverse effect, making the consumer’s carbon footprint sensitivity level an incentive to increase consumer surplus and social welfare. © (2024), (American Institute of Mathematical Sciences).

7,Transparency pays: How carbon emission disclosure lowers cost of capital,Article,Xu W.; Sun Z.; Ni H.,Economic Analysis and Policy,83.0,2024,165,177,10.1016/j.eap.2024.05.020,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196404069&doi=10.1016%2fj.eap.2024.05.020&partnerID=40&md5=7e6051584a095fd04ce32c76cdeda1f4,03135926,Scopus,Carbon emission disclosure; Implied cost of capital; Stock liquidity,"Amidst increasing global attention on corporate environmental responsibility, the impact of carbon emission disclosure on financial outcomes remains a pertinent question. Existing literature suggests that transparency in carbon disclosure can influence investor perception and capital costs, yet detailed mechanisms and broader economic implications are less understood. In this study, using data from Chinese publicly traded companies from 2017 to 2022, we investigate how carbon emission disclosure affects the implied cost of capital, with a focus on the mediating role of stock liquidity. Our findings reveal that enhanced transparency in carbon reporting significantly lowers the implied cost of capital by improving stock liquidity, a previously underexplored channel. This effect is particularly pronounced in sectors with high carbon footprints and within regions emphasizing sustainable finance policies. The results underscore the economic benefits of environmental transparency, suggesting that robust disclosure practices can serve as a strategic tool for firms to reduce financing costs while contributing to broader sustainability goals. © 2024"
8,Using miscanthus and biochar as sustainable substrates in horticulture: An economic and carbon footprint assessment of their primary and cascading value chains,Article,Ruett J.; Abdelshafy A.; Walther G.,Sustainable Production and Consumption,49.0,2024,163,178,10.1016/j.spc.2024.06.016,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196799136&doi=10.1016%2fj.spc.2024.06.016&partnerID=40&md5=c6036c6f7ba0910e1b3795a5d72a0242,23525509,Scopus,Biochar; Carbon removal; Cascading value chains; Horticultural substrates; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle costing,"Conventional substrates like peat, stone wool and coconut coir are responsible for high greenhouse gas emissions in the horticultural sector, necessitating low-emission and cost-efficient alternatives. Herein, using miscanthus and biochar as substrate components as well as in cascading substrate application can be alternative practices in a sustainable bioeconomy. However, the carbon footprint and economic impacts of these practices in relation to crop yields have not yet been investigated. Hence, we combined life cycle carbon footprint assessment and costing to analyze the Global Warming Potential and value chain costs of horticultural substrates in tomato cultivation in North-Rhine Westphalia. We conducted a comparison between conventional substrates (peat, stone wool, and coconut coir) and single use and cascading miscanthus-based substrates with and without 1–2 % biochar addition of the miscanthus mass. Also, a subsequent scenario analysis was carried out to examine alterations in inputs and costs. Our results demonstrate that miscanthus-based substrates are climate-friendly and low-cost alternatives to the conventional practices. Switching to miscanthus-based substrates results in more emission savings than other input scenarios investigated. Additionally, incorporating biochar and adopting cascading methods contribute to lower emissions. Notably, biochar has the most significant impact, as its amount correlates with higher emission reductions. Additionally, costs for cascading miscanthus-based substrates are lower compared to conventional substrates. Overall, there is only a slight variance in costs between conventional and miscanthus-based substrates. However, with the introduction of carbon emission pricing and carbon removal certificates, miscanthus-based and biochar-containing substrates may emerge as more cost-efficient alternatives. Thus, by advancing financial instruments on carbon emissions and removal, introducing cascade use within and beyond the horticulture sector, and supporting cultivation of sustainable biomasses, miscanthus and biochar can effectively contribute to the development of a sustainable bioeconomy. © 2024 The Authors"
9,Facing the solid waste of cotton straw and plastic mulch film mixture in China: Centralized or decentralized pyrolysis facility?,Article,Zhang H.; Jiang P.; Zhao G.; Li L.; Chen M.; Mu L.; Lu X.; Zhu J.,Waste Management,187.0,2024,22,30,10.1016/j.wasman.2024.07.003,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197439119&doi=10.1016%2fj.wasman.2024.07.003&partnerID=40&md5=195b537a13b61fae3f8db090ff335277,0956053X,Scopus,Biomass; CO<sub>2</sub> mitigation; Life-cycle assessment; Mobile pyrolysis; Plastic mulch film,"The widespread use of plastic mulch film (PMF) has led to significant environmental pollution, with PMF residues dispersed and mixed with straw and soil, posing challenges for recycling. Here, we proposed the mobile pyrolysis facility for the cotton straw and mulch film mixture (CMM) to mitigate the collection, storage, and transportation costs, while the application of co-pyrolysis technology for CMM conversion could improve the added value of products. Additionally, centralized combustion power generation and centralized pyrolysis systems were also established to evaluate and compare their sustainability from economic and environmental perspectives. Results showed that mobile pyrolysis has better economic performance than the centralized scenarios, due to its high internal rate of return (31 %) and significant net present value (29.21 M USD). Meanwhile, the mobile pyrolysis facility achieved a GWP of −1.298 kgCO2-eq/kg, reducing emissions by 70.79 % and 38.82 % compared to the two centralized scenarios. In conclusion, mobile pyrolysis technology provides a promising solution for PMF residue recycling because of its economically competitive approach with a lower carbon footprint. © 2024"
10,The effect on the carbon footprint of the rice-wheat system of substituting chemical fertilizers by pig manure: The results of a field experiment,Article,Xu Y.; Sheng J.; Zhang Y.; Zhang L.; Kan Z.-R.; Sun G.; Zheng J.,Sustainable Production and Consumption,49.0,2024,1,11,10.1016/j.spc.2024.06.003,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195451336&doi=10.1016%2fj.spc.2024.06.003&partnerID=40&md5=96babb90e68f959a02f31e3ab60a1a0a,23525509,Scopus,Biogas slurry; Carbon footprint; Grain yield; Greenhouse gas emission; Pig manure; Soil organic carbon,"Livestock manure is widely recycled to enhance intensive agricultural production. Nevertheless, the environmental and agronomic benefits of liquid manure, such as biogas slurry, have rarely been comprehensively evaluated. To boost food production while maintaining environmental sustainability, a field experiment was performed to assess the effects of solid and liquid manure substitution for chemical fertilizer on direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, soil organic carbon (SOC), grain yield, and carbon footprints (CF) in a rice-wheat system. The treatments involved only chemical fertilizer (NPK), 50 % NPK + 50 % pig manure (50 % PM), 100 % pig manure (100%PM), 50 % NPK + 50 % biogas slurry from PM (50 % PS), and 100 % biogas slurry from PM (100 % PS) in the circumstances of equal nitrogen fertilization. The results showed that rice CH4 emissions dominated the direct GHG emissions, and followed the order of 100%PM > 50%PM > 50%PS = NPK = 100%PS on average of three years. The 100%PM had the highest area-scaled CF with 11.84 Mg CO2-eq ha−1 due to high CH4 emissions and carbon emissions from pig manure production and compost indirectly without considering the changes in SOC stock. Meanwhile, 100%PM significantly increased SOC stock at 0–30 cm depth by 49.1 %, 11.8 %, 44.8 %, and 56.5 % compared with NPK, 50%PM, 50%PS, and 100%PS, respectively (P < 0.05). Notably, 100 % PM had the lowest area-scaled CF with 0.99 Mg CO2-eq ha−1 when considering the changes in SOC stock, followed by 50%PM. The 50%PM significantly increased the annual grain yield of rice and wheat from 2010 to 2018, with an average of 4.9 %, 4.5 %, and 5.7 % compared with NPK, 100%PM, and 100%PS, respectively (P < 0.05). Overall, although there was a trade-off between SOC sequestration and CH4 emissions under pig manure, pig manure substitution for chemical fertilizer significantly decreased yield-scaled CF, followed by biogas slurry substitution relative to NPK (P < 0.05). Thus, pig manure substitution for chemical fertilizer is recommended for environmental and yield benefits simultaneously considering the whole chain of production process in a rice-wheat system. In future, strategic fertilizer management based on PM and PS could potentially offer a sustainable solution to mitigate the trade-off and sustain the respective benefits of PM (i.e. SOC and grain yield) and PS (i.e. CH4 emissions). © 2024"
11,Modelling of carbon flows in the value chain of packaging plastics in the context of sustainable carbon management,Article,Van der Perre S.; Mynko O.; Van Geem K.M.; Wyns T.,Sustainable Production and Consumption,49.0,2024,12,27,10.1016/j.spc.2024.06.002,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195610126&doi=10.1016%2fj.spc.2024.06.002&partnerID=40&md5=6b01e10fe27a166ece575449bfbee433,23525509,Scopus,Biobased feedstock; Carbon management; Chemical recycling; Circularity; Electric steam cracking; Plastic packaging value chain,"The low share of plastic recycling means significant losses for the economy as well as for the environment, especially for plastic packaging materials since they are the largest end-use market for plastics and characterized by a typical short first-use cycle. The main polymers used in packaging applications are basic polymers, such as PE, PP, PS and PET, which consist mainly of fossil carbon locked up in polymer form. This study attempts to map carbon flows across the packaging plastics value chain with the goal to optimize carbon fixation in relevant polymers over multiple life cycles and minimize carbon loss to the atmosphere via CO2 emissions. Evaluating these carbon balances in the production, consumption and end-of-life treatment phase of these polymers provides more insight in the carbon losses during their life cycle. Three case studies were considered; (1) a baseline route (BASE), representing the current linear plastics economy model which is benchmarked with two theoretical sustainable scenarios: (2) an electrified (ELEC) and (3) a biobased (BIO) route. Specific parameters and assumptions in these three cases were adapted, such as feedstock type, recycling rate, type of recycling etc. Improved recycling rates and advanced recycling methods were applied in the sustainable cases and had a positive effect on carbon retention in products. Allowing a numerical comparison, a method was developed to quantify this carbon retention via the half lifetime of carbon in materials over multiple life cycles. The half lifetime evolved from 0.3 year in the BASE route to 2.0 and 2.6 years in the BIO and ELEC route, respectively. However, even these sustainable, optimized routes remained insufficient to embed carbon in plastic products for many years without too much carbon loss. It is inevitable that an enhanced (carbon) circularity in these routes comes by a certain energy cost; about 46 GJ more energy was required per extra recycled ton carbon in the ELEC route (compared to BASE). But at the same time this intensified carbon conservation leads to a CO2 emission reduction potential of 80 %. The present work illustrates the potential of chemical recycling, and carbon capture and utilization (CCU) techniques for end-of-life treatment of plastic packaging products, but additional process development and process intensification in all facets of the value chain are needed to minimize carbon leakage over multiple lifecycles. Hence, waste management policy could be an important instrument to support further enhancement in plastics circularity. © 2024"
12,How will manufacturing capacity additions in China and North America affect the carbon footprint of silicon photovoltaics?,Article,Yuan L.; Farina A.; Anctil A.,Sustainable Production and Consumption,49.0,2024,236,248,10.1016/j.spc.2024.06.014,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197464227&doi=10.1016%2fj.spc.2024.06.014&partnerID=40&md5=088fb8120c2361995a5436cf40586c16,23525509,Scopus,China; Crystalline silicon; Life cycle assessment; Low-carbon solar; North America,"Global annual PV installation is expected to increase from 150 GW in 2021 to 820 GW in 2030 to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Electricity production from PV generates almost zero carbon emissions, but the emissions from the manufacturing phase are nonnegligible. While most installed PV modules in the US are imported from China, manufacturers are expanding the manufacturing capacity in North America to reduce reliance on Chinese PV modules. Although it has been commonly perceived that the North American modules would have a lower environmental footprint than Chinese ones, the effect of capacity expansions and regional impact considering where each component is produced has yet to be fully understood. This study aims to compare the carbon footprint and cumulative energy demand of PERC modules manufactured in China and North America based on the expected 2024 manufacturing capacity additions. We develop PV manufacturing scenarios to perform life cycle assessment (LCA) for the first time considering the regional manufacturing capacity, partnerships between suppliers and manufacturers, and regional electricity grids, while previous PV LCA studies evaluated the national average production. The carbon footprint of China's PERC modules for monofacial and bifacial designs, when using the national average grid, is 517 and 412 kg CO2eq/kWp, respectively. In comparison, the GWP of modules produced in North America is 22.0–22.2 % lower than in China, a difference attributed to the lower carbon footprint of electricity grids. When considering where each component is made, the GWP increases by 1.5 % in China compared to the national average. This difference arises because most of China's solar manufacturing facilities are in regions with higher carbon intensity grids than the national average. Solar manufacturers can reduce the carbon footprint of their products by changing manufacturing locations or increasing the share of renewable sources for manufacturing. We find that both China- and North America-made PERC modules meet the Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) low carbon solar criteria (630 kg CO2eq/kWp). However, to meet the ultra-low carbon solar criteria (400 kg CO2eq/kWp), a significant share, approximately 60 % for China and 15 % for North America, of the total electricity supply must be sourced from renewable energy in addition to the existing grid. This study identifies the significant impact of manufacturing locations on the overall carbon footprint of PV modules. It is important to consider production locations by stage and the regional electricity supply when developing the carbon assessment methodology of PV modules. Otherwise, manufacturers may take advantage of assessing carbon footprint using the country's average grid while producing products in dirty grid regions. © 2024 Institution of Chemical Engineers"
13,Potential of achieving sustainable development through integrated optimization of mariculture species based on the food-energy-water nexus in China,Article,Cao W.; Wang F.; Chen K.; Yang S.; Cao W.,Sustainable Production and Consumption,49.0,2024,208,218,10.1016/j.spc.2024.06.025,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197095099&doi=10.1016%2fj.spc.2024.06.025&partnerID=40&md5=f3583ea30e76ddad137b7a6b911b4a75,23525509,Scopus,Environmental footprint; Food‑carbon-water nexus; Mariculture; Multi-objective optimization; Sustainable development,"The sustainability of mariculture possesses substantial enormous potential in food security and the mitigation of global warming. Based on the food‑carbon-water nexus, this study assessed the carbon and water footprints of mariculture in China, identified key drivers, and constructed a multi-objective optimization model of mariculture structure. Results showed that the carbon and water footprints of mariculture in China increased continuously from 2008 to 2020, with the intensity of carbon footprint increasing from 0.08 to 0.14 t CO2/t and that of water footprint increasing from 5436.72 to 6169.01 m3/t. Shellfish showed lower intensity of footprints than fish and crustaceans. The carbon footprint intensity of mariculture was high in Tianjin and Hainan but resulted in negative carbon emissions in Shandong and Liaoning. Hainan, Hebei, and Liaoning provinces had the highest average annual water footprint intensity. Provincial population and total mariculture production significantly impacted the carbon and water footprints of mariculture. Optimizing mariculture species structure can reduce carbon and water footprints while increasing protein production. However, a large gap still exists between the current development and optimization scenarios for mariculture structure in China. A targeted increase in the production of mariculture species such as plaice in Tianjin, American redfish in Guangxi, oysters and scallops in Guangdong, wakame in Liaoning, and gracilaria in Fujian, can help promote low carbon and water-saving practices, thus achieving sustainable mariculture development. Therefore, China's mariculture should continuously optimize its structure and enhance carbon sink capacity in the future. © 2024 Institution of Chemical Engineers"
14,Operating Room Waste Generated From Corneal and Conjunctival Surgeries,Article,Thakur S.; Sheppard J.D.; Eslani M.; Pavilack M.A.; Philippy B.; Ramanathan G.C.; Cheung A.Y.,Cornea,43.0,2024,1031,1039,10.1097/ICO.0000000000003560,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197605211&doi=10.1097%2fICO.0000000000003560&partnerID=40&md5=e68cfefc91249bd6f1b37a22ea98ebf2,02773740,Scopus,biomedical waste; cataract surgery; conjunctival surgery; corneal surgery; environment health; environmental impact; global warming; surgical waste; sustainability; waste; waste management,"Purpose:The purposes of this study were to bring awareness to the surgical waste generated from corneal and conjunctival surgeries and to compare those findings with the waste generated from cataract surgeries.Methods:This was an observational prospective pilot cohort study at a tertiary corneal/anterior segment private practice. All waste related to cataract, cornea, and conjunctival surgical procedures (including anesthesia waste and corneal tissue storage) was weighed. The primary outcome was total waste generated while other outcomes included surgical setting (ambulatory surgical center, hospital, and minor operating room) and comparison of corneal/conjunctival surgeries with cataract surgery.Results:Surgical waste data were collected from 119 surgeries (82 corneal/conjunctival surgeries and 37 cataract surgeries). Hospital surgeries produced more waste than ambulatory surgical center and minor operating room surgeries. Penetrating keratoplasty (2.22 kg, P = 0.483) and Descemet stripping only (2.11 kg, P = 0.326) procedures generated comparable mean waste with cataract surgery (2.07 kg) while endothelial keratoplasties produced more (P < 0.001, 0.002). (Deep) anterior lamellar keratoplasty results depended on the surgical setting. All conjunctival surgeries produced less waste than cataract surgery.Conclusions:In comparison with cataract surgery, keratoplasties overall produced comparable or more waste while conjunctival surgeries produced less waste. The surgical setting and type of anesthesia played a substantial role in the amount of waste generated. Assessing waste production from different ophthalmic surgeries may increase awareness of the negative environmental impact of surgical waste and promote practice or legal changes to improve environmental sustainability.

Wheat, being a widely cultivated and easily accessible crop globally, contains abundant carbon elements. In this study, wheat powder served as the carbon precursor, and β-alanine, rich in amino and carboxyl groups, was introduced into the hierarchical pore structure of wheat powder. Subsequently, the material underwent secondary hydrothermal treatment with the activation agent potassium hydroxide (KOH), resulting in hydrothermal wheat powder PCF (HWPCF) rich in a three-dimensional interconnected structure with layered pores as the representative feature. This structural treatment increased the specific surface area (2278 m2·g−1) and total pore volume (1.17 cm3·g−1) of PCF, accelerating the rapid mass transfer of gas molecules and significantly enhancing the utilization of adsorption sites in the modified PCF. HWPCF exhibited outstanding adsorption performance for acetone (608.7 mg g−1) and n-hexane (517.6 mg g−1). In addition, the modified PCF showed good adsorption capacity for CO2 (4.99 mmol·g−1). This study highlights the effective modification of expired wheat powder with β-alanine, reducing the overall carbon footprint of the production process and achieving the reuse of waste in an environmentally friendly manner. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Korean Institute of Chemical Engineers, Seoul, Korea 2024."
16,Environmental life cycle assessment of reusable launch vehicle fleets: Large climate impact driven by rocket exhaust emissions,Article,Dominguez Calabuig G.J.; Wilson A.; Bi S.; Vasile M.; Sippel M.; Tajmar M.,Acta Astronautica,221.0,2024,1,11,10.1016/j.actaastro.2024.05.009,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193203967&doi=10.1016%2fj.actaastro.2024.05.009&partnerID=40&md5=3030343ea9fa21cc7f0b920cfd1cbaed,00945765,Scopus,Environmental footprint; Launchers; LCA; Reusability; Sustainability,"After the success of the reusable Falcon 9 rocket, space actors are pursuing competitive space access by developing Reusable Launch Vehicles (RLVs). While this initiative may enhance recycling rates, it may also trigger the Jevons’ paradox as it amplifies the overall environmental footprint due to increased launch frequencies. It is therefore essential to quantify RLVs’ impacts and identify key design drivers to enable efficient design choices while mitigating undesirable environmental effects. Consequently, this article uses a space specific Life Cycle assessment (LCA) approach to evaluate the environmental footprint, in terms of climate impact, water depletion and land use, of different RLV fleets designed to serve a forecasted European space market. The results show that the LH2 fleet options have 2–8 times lower carbon footprint when compared to the LCH4 fleet as a result of lower propellant consumption and lack of black carbon emissions, suggesting that the environmental burdens are mostly driven by propellant choice. Moreover, the analysis reveals a potential underestimation of climate impacts in previous LCA's by 2–3 orders of magnitude due to the absence of high altitude characterisation of rocket exhaust emissions and demised aluminium oxides. This increased forcing could lead to fleet choices surpassing the Earth's carrying capacity given by its planetary boundaries. The methodology and results within this study can support further integration of launch and reentry emissions within LCA by refining modelling techniques, improving impact characterisation and quantifying uncertainties. These advancements can ultimately enable robust eco-design strategies for launch vehicles. © 2024 The Authors"

To do this, the main objective of this study is to inspect the effect of green technologies, economic complexity, renewable energy consumption, and human capital on the ecological footprint in the case of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) countries over the span of 1990–2020. Accordingly, this study applied novel and unconventional panel methods that provide reliable and robust estimated findings under slope heterogeneity and cross-dependency issues. The estimated results from cross-sectional autoregressive distributive lag (CS-ARDL) presents that the influence of green technologies, human capital, and renewable energy significantly protects the environment. On the other hand, economic complexity damages the environment in the long run. Furthermore, the evidence confirms that the interactive role of renewable energy consumption is also beneficial to protect the environment. Besides, the interactive role of green technologies and renewable energy consumption significantly protect the environment in the BRICS region. From a policy perspective, this study advocates that it is crucial to accelerate green technological innovations in BRICS economies, including the regulatory policies encouraging an incessant upsurge in the share of green technologies, renewable energy consumption, and human capital into environmental technological progress. © 2024 International Association for Gondwana Research"

While coal stands out as the primary energy source, it also contributes to pollution. Each year, an immense volume of agro-industrial waste is produced as a consequence of the world population's growth and developments in the food and agriculture sectors. The challenges of municipal waste management and leveraging alternative energy sources have spurred a growing interest in the valorization of waste materials. This research paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the production of Refused Derived Fuel (RDF) pellets from food and garden waste (FGW) as a sustainable approach to waste diversion, bio-energy generation and as a soil enhancer. It encompasses multiple stages of the pelletization process, including preprocessing, characterization, pellet production, and the evaluation of pellet properties. The biomasses were mixed at different proportion such as 0:100 (P1), 50:50 (P2), 30:70 (P3) and 70:30 (P4) in 100 g without binder and 45:45:10 (P5), 40:40:20 (P6), 30:40:30 (P7) and 25:35:40 (P8) in 100 g with paper as binding agent. The findings highlight that among these combinations, the 30:70 ratio (P3) stands out as the most promising option. It demonstrates a notable calorific value of 21.7MJ/kg, proves to be economically viable, readily obtainable, and showcases remarkable shape retention qualities, all while leaving behind minimal ash residue. This study incorporates the characteristics study like Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and physical characteristics analysis of proximate and ultimate analysis. The results shows the concentration of Nitrogen and Sulphur in less than 1% in the pellet which indicates that it could be used as a promising alternate solid fuel for household and industrial application. Waste-based pellets can help lower the carbon footprint and their negative effects on the environment worldwide. Our study highlights the potential of FGW pellets as a source of renewable energy and adds to the body of knowledge on sustainable waste management technique. Government policies, incentives, and use of innovative technologies must be encouraged to guide future research for cost-effective, cleaner bio-coal production. © 2024 The Institution of Chemical Engineers"

In this work, the life-cycle performance of a system compiling a CLDRM unit paired with a water gas shift unit, a pressure swing adsorption unit, and a combined cycle scheme to provide steam and electricity was assessed. The main data needed to reflect the behavior of the reforming reaction was obtained experimentally and implemented in an Aspen Plus® simulation. Inventory data was obtained through process simulation and used to assess the environmental performance of the process in terms of carbon footprint, acidification, freshwater eutrophication, ozone depletion, photochemical ozone formation, and depletion of minerals and metals. Overall, the environmental viability of the production of green hydrogen from biogas was found to be heavily dependent on the biogas leakage in anaerobic digestion plants. The CLDRM system was benchmarked against a conventional DRM implementation for the same feedstock. While the conventional DRM plant environmentally outperformed the perovskite-based CLDRM, the latter might present advantages from an implementation point of view. © 2024 The Authors"

We herein demonstrated the surface engineering of LWAs for the green fertilizer application by hydrothermally depositing iron species (Fe@LWAs) to increase the chemical reactivity. The obtained Fe@LWAs were first applied to adsorb nutrients (NH4+ and PO43−). Desorption of the adsorbed nutrients was then utilized as the replacement of commercial chemical fertilizer to cultivate mung bean sprouts to further biofix environmental CO2. Experimental results showed that the deposited iron species was the dominant component regulating the chemical behaviors of Fe@LWAs and adsorbed PO43− played an important role for Fe@LWAs to adsorb NH4+. With the coexistence of NH4+ and PO43−, the adsorption capacities of Fe@LWAs were 0.220 mg-NH4+/g and 0.486 mg-PO43−/g. The growth rate of mung bean sprouts using nutrient loaded Fe@LWAs was similar to those cultivated using commercial chemical fertilizer. Despite the nutrient recovery and mung bean cultivation decreasing the carbon footprint of the Fe@LWAs, the preparation of LWAs by high temperature sintering and the following hydrothermal surface modification consumed intensive energy. Consequently, the green fertilizer application of Fe@LWAs requires at least 594 cycles of nutrient recovery and mung bean cultivation to reach negative carbon emissions. Importantly, the cultivated mung bean sprouts could return to the soil to effectively secure the biofixed CO2, which could contribute additional environmental implications by increasing the organic content in the soil at the same time. © 2024"

It significantly decreases the carbon footprint to a considerable extent. The utilization of machine learning techniques in the construction industry is poised to become increasingly prevalent due to its ability to forecast the mechanical properties of concrete mix designs based on their components, thereby obviating the need for destructive testing. The objective of this research is to construct predictive models for the compressive strength of geopolymer concrete mixed with alccofine and subsequently verify their accuracy through comparison with observed values. The results of the experimental investigation indicate that the compressive strength is greater when subjected to oven-dried curing in comparison to ambient curing conditions. The addition of alccofine results in an increase in compressive strength up to a certain percentage, beyond which a decrease is observed. Machine learning techniques such as support vector regression (SVR), gene expression programming (GEP), and artificial neural network (ANN) have been deployed to construct models based on empirical observations. The output variable considered in this study is compressive strength, while the input variables comprise a range of influencing parameters that are utilized for both training and testing purposes. The efficacy of anticipated values is evaluated through diverse statistical parameters. The ANN model outperforms the SVR and GEP models in terms of predictive accuracy, as evidenced by its superior statistical performance when comparing actual and predicted values. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Shiraz University 2023."

Methods: Bioactive compounds from pomegranate waste were obtained by green solvent extraction and quantitatively analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Antimicrobial efficacy was also determined. Chicken patties enriched with extracts to monitor thiobarbituric acid (TBA), total volatile nitrogen (TVN), water holding capacity (WHC), pH, and cooking properties during 12 days of 4 °C storage, and half-life was determined. Results: The major bioactive compounds in seed and peel extracts were tannic (18.95 and 41.25 mg/kg) and gallic acid (16.49 and 36.59 mg/kg). Phenolics and flavonoids reached 66.71 and 9.72 mg/mL in seeds and 187.60 and 25.53 mg/mL in peels. Extracts showed antimicrobial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with considerable inhibition zones for seed (10, 9, 8 µm/mL) and peel (12, 10, and 10 µm/mL). Formulating chicken patties with 1%(w/w) extracts reduced lipid oxidation (TBA), TVN, and cooking loss by 48.2, 49.2, and 6.6% but increased WHC by 14.9% at the end of storage. Conclusion: The study enlightened the feasibility of using peels and seeds of pomegranate as a natural and economical alternative to chemical preservatives to prolong the shelf-life of meat products. The proposed valorization methodology converted food waste to natural preservatives and reduced food waste by extending patties’ shelf-life. Implementing such a “waste valorization” and “waste reduction” approach could significantly enhance resource efficiency to meet sustainable development goals (SDGs) and net zero. Recommendation: Future research might consider using emerging technologies (e.g., ultrasound and electric field) to increase extraction efficiency and nanotechnology to enhance the stability of seed and peel extracts. Also, establishing a well-planned collecting and transporting methodology for fresh pomegranate waste to limit microbial contaminations could be considered for successful practical applications.

23,The ecological footprint of industrial value added and energy consumption in Indonesia,Article,Kurniawan R.; Nugroho N.A.A.; Fudholi A.; Purwanto A.; Sumargo B.; Gio P.U.; Wongsonadi S.K.,International Journal of Energy Sector Management,18.0,2024,1127,1153,10.1108/IJESM-05-2023-0006,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85175555742&doi=10.1108%2fIJESM-05-2023-0006&partnerID=40&md5=8d48d02207d307db80b5ce7dbe932ed6,17506220,Scopus,Ecological footprint; Industrial value-added; Nonrenewable energy; Renewable energy; Vector autoregressive,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to determine the effect of the industrial sector, renewable energy consumption and nonrenewable energy consumption in Indonesia on the ecological footprint from 1990 to 2020 in the short and long term. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses vector error correction model (VECM) analysis to examine the relationship in the short and long term. In addition, the impulse response function is used to enable future forecasts up to 2060 of the ecological footprint as a measure of environmental degradation caused by changes or shocks in industrial value-added, renewable energy consumption and nonrenewable energy consumption. Furthermore, forecast error decomposition of variance (FEVD) analysis is carried out to predict the percentage contribution of each variable’s variance to changes in a specific variable. Granger causality testing is used to enhance the analysis outcomes within the framework of VECM. Findings: Using VECM analysis, the speed of adjustment for environmental damage is quite high in the short term, at 246%. This finding suggests that when there is a short-term imbalance in industrial value-added, renewable energy consumption and nonrenewable energy consumption, the ecological footprint experiences a very rapid adjustment, at 246%, to move towards long-term balance. Then, in the long term, the ecological footprint in Indonesia is most influenced by nonrenewable energy consumption. This is also confirmed by the Granger causality test and the results of FEVD, which show that the contribution of nonrenewable energy consumption will be 10.207% in 2060 and will be the main contributor to the ecological footprint in the coming years to achieve net-zero emissions in 2060. In the long run, renewable energy consumption has a negative effect on the ecological footprint, whereas industrial value-added and nonrenewable energy consumption have a positive effect. Originality/value: For the first time, value added from the industrial sector is being used alongside renewable and nonrenewable energy consumption to measure Indonesia’s ecological footprint. The primary cause of Indonesia’s alarming environmental degradation is the industrial sector, which acts as the driving force behind this issue. Consequently, this contribution is expected to inform the policy implications required to achieve zero carbon emissions by 2060, aligned with the G20 countries’ Bali agreement of 2022. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Nevertheless, this source provides valuable insights into customer behavior and product interaction, serving as a powerful tool for understanding customer needs and improving retention efforts. This paper aims to explore the value of usage data for B2B customer churn prediction using a real-world dataset with 3959 subscriptions from a European software provider. The contribution to literature is two-fold. First, we define a framework to structure usage data into cross-sectional features that could be included in predictive models. We study the impact of usage information on churn prediction performance along three primary components– timing, granularity, and expertise. The findings confirm the value of this data source and two of the three examined components, particularly in terms of AUC and TDL. Second, we provide insights into the carbon footprint of the entire modeling process required to integrate usage data into different machine-learning algorithms. Furthermore, to strengthen the robustness of our findings, we compare five common machine-learning algorithms in CCP. Consequently, this study uncovered unexplored aspects of usage data and practical implications for enhancing churn prediction in a B2B setting. © 2023"

It accounts for 8% to 10% of France’s GHG emissions. Although the medical community has been alerted to the problem, more data are needed. This study aimed to determine the carbon footprint of a surgical pathology laboratory. Methods: The study was conducted in the surgical pathology laboratory at Saint Vincent hospital (Lille) in 2021. It represented 17,242 patient cases corresponding to 54,124 paraffin blocks. The 17 staff members performed cytology, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization. The study included all inputs, capital equipment, freight, travel, energy consumption, and waste. Carbon emission factors were based on the French Agence De l’Environnement et de la Maîtrise de l’Energie database. Results: In 2021, the pathology laboratory’s carbon footprint was 117 tons of CO2 equivalent (t CO2e), corresponding to 0.5% of Saint Vincent hospital’s total emissions. The most significant emissions categories were inputs (60 t CO2e; 51%), freight associated with inputs (24 t CO2e; 20%), and travel (14 t CO2e; 12%). Waste and energy generated 10 t CO2e (9%) and 9 t CO2e (8%), respectively.

In the present study, contrary to most previous studies in which the sources of feedstock's preparation were considered as block boxes, two stand-alone processes are taken into account and incorporated into the e-fuels production system. H2 is obtained by a high-temperature electrolysis system having an overall efficiency nearly twice that of a low-temperature electrolysis system. CO2 is captured from a power plant flue gas stream with a purity of 99.81%. Investigating heat integration potential in such an integrated plant is an up-to-date and interesting topic and has not yet been well explored. Therefore, a heat integration within the three individual processes is implemented to reduce energy consumption. The design of the process-to-process heat transfer section is carried out using pinch design rules. By integrating individual units, approximately 42% of the required cold utility, traditionally supplied by chilled water and refrigerants, is allocated to generate high and medium-pressure steams. Having used the high-temperature steam electrolysis for H2 production, a process that requires less external electricity compared to low-temperature water electrolysis, a power-to-liquid efficiency of 70% is achieved. Furthermore, the results reveal a carbon conversion ratio of 98.6%, indicating the effective converting the carbon from the feedstock into liquid hydrocarbons. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC"

Cement-based stabilization methods, common in these regions, contribute to climate change due to their high carbon footprint. This study explored the potential application of coir fiber-reinforced laterite soil-bottom ash mixtures as embankment materials in the tropics. The objective is to enhance engineered embankment slopes’ erosion resistance and stability while offering reuse options for industrial byproducts. This study examined various mix designs for unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and permeability, utilizing 30% bottom ash (BA) and 1% coir fiber (CF) with varying sizes ranging from 10 to 40 mm, 6% lime, and laterite soil (LS), followed by microstructural analyses. The results demonstrate that the compressive strength increases as the CF length increases to 25 mm. In contrast, permeability increases continuously with increasing CF length. Lime-treated mixtures exhibit superior short- and long-term strength and reduce permeability owing to the formation of cementitious materials, as confirmed by microstructural analyses. A lab-scale slope box was constructed to evaluate the surface erosion of the stabilized laterite soil embankment. Based on the rainfall simulation results, the LS-BA-CF mixtures show better resistance to erosion and deformation compared to untreated LS, especially when lime is added to the top layer. This study provides insights into a sustainable and cost-effective approach for slope stabilization using BA and CF, offering a promising solution for tropical regions susceptible to surface erosion and landslides. © Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024."

However, their non-uniform shapes makes the construction of stone masonry structures challenging. Therefore, the development of efficient algorithms for the stacking of irregular stones obeying structural and architectonic requirements is essential. In this paper, we propose an image-based method for automating the stacking of non-uniform stones in the construction of 2D load-resistant stone masonry walls. Stone wedging, a traditional technique employed by skilled masons, is implemented to reinforce the stability of stone placements. We use image processing for accelerating the stone selection and placement, and determine the wall's resistance using a variational rigid-block modeling approach. It is demonstrated that the developed method is efficient and robust in challenging conditions. The analysis of the computational performance of the presented method shows that it is suitable for automated construction. © 2024 The Authors"

The aim is to innovate construction materials with a reduced carbon footprint, without prioritizing high mechanical performance. The sediment was processed to achieve two levels of fineness, namely 10 microns and 2 microns, to increase its reactive potential. The formulation of the eco-binder involved a mixture of 75% port sediment and 25% WPFA. Findings indicate that optimal compressive strengths, reaching 14.8 MPa, were obtained in highly humid environments (> 95% RH) at a temperature of 50 °C. It was observed that finer sediment particle size (2 microns) contributed to enhanced mechanical properties. Nonetheless, the sediment's pozzolanic activity is somewhat restricted at ambient temperatures, necessitating specific conditions for effective reactions. Environmental safety assessments confirm that the produced eco-binder meets the criteria set forth in the SETRA guidelines for sustainable use in construction. The leaching and release potential of WPFA after the development of the eco-binder was meticulously assessed using the four-phase sequential extraction method recommended by the Reference Bureau of the European Communities Commission (BCR). A marked change was observed in the speciation of trace metal elements, with a predominant transition from the soluble fraction to the carbonate fraction, attributed to the carbonation process. In conclusion, the marine sediment investigated shows promise as a sustainable construction material, provided that controlled temperature and humidity conditions are maintained to attain adequate mechanical strengths. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Japan KK, part of Springer Nature 2024."
30,Fuel Consumption and CO2 Emissions in Fully Mechanized Cut-to-Length (CTL) Harvesting Operations of Industrial Roundwood: A Review,Article,Kärhä K.; Eliasson L.; Kühmaier M.; Spinelli R.,Current Forestry Reports,10.0,2024,255,272,10.1007/s40725-024-00219-3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193046594&doi=10.1007%2fs40725-024-00219-3&partnerID=40&md5=bba44e1311c7709fe9935dfb2f99c3be,21986436,Scopus,Extraction; Felling-processing; Forest operations; Forwarder; Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; Harvester; Logging,"Purpose of Review: The aim of this literature review was to bring together the most relevant and recent research information on the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions caused by the fully mechanized cut-to-length (CTL) harvesting machinery when applied to industrial roundwood. A specific aim of this review was to describe the effect of different independent variables on fuel consumption in fully mechanized CTL wood-harvesting operations. Recent Findings: The review showed that the engine power of CTL forest machines accounts for most of the variance in the hourly fuel consumption of both harvesters and forwarders. We underline that the cubic-metre-based fuel consumption of CTL forest machines is correlated to the same factors that affect work productivity. Among all influencing factors, the average stem size, removal intensity and silvicultural treatment have the strongest effect on the fuel consumption per m3 incurred with felling-processing, whereas forwarding distance, removal intensity and payload size are the main drivers of fuel consumption per m3 as incurred with extraction. Further influencing factors are soil type (mineral soil or peatland), use of tracks, assortment type and machine size. Together with those factors, the role of the machine operator remains crucial and is dependent on two separate skills: the capacity to achieve high productivity, and that to apply fuel-saving driving techniques. Summary: The easiest way to reduce the carbon footprint of CTL harvesting machines is to increase the productivity of the harvesting work, for example by giving machine operator-specific training to utilize more efficient work methods and economic energy-efficient driving techniques. Furthermore, several other measures to reduce the carbon footprint of CTL harvesting operations were discussed in this review. Finally, we recommend that all essential variables that have a significant impact on the productivity of harvesting work, fuel consumption and CO2 emissions are reported in study papers in the future. © The Author(s) 2024."

However, in vivo CoA synthesis is often limited by feedback inhibition and the cost of purification; instead, in vitro enzymatic CoA synthesis represents a sustainable alternative. Herein, we present a one-pot chemo-enzymatic cascade pathway for free CoA synthesis from pantethine using recombinant enzymes purified from probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle (endotoxin-free), along with the polyphosphate kinase system for ATP regeneration and the phosphite dehydrogenase system for NADH regeneration, respectively. First, we selected the nontoxic biological reductant glutathione for chemical pantethine reduction, where the glutathione is readily reduced by the NAD(P)H-dependent glutathione reductase. The one-pot enzymatic cascade (comprising pantothenate kinase, pantetheine-phosphate adenylyltransferase, and dephospho-CoA kinase) then completely converts pantetheine into free CoA in 2 h with a titer of ∼2 mM (1.5 g/L) in a 0.1 mL reaction system. Finally, the quality of the chemoenzymatically synthesized CoA rivals that of the commercial CoA standard for acetyl-CoA synthesis. Copurifying the recombinant enzymes from probiotic E. coli Nissle and the use of inorganic phosphate buffer further reduce the environmental burdens and carbon footprint of the whole process. Therefore, the present work could serve as a paradigm for future industrial production of acyl-CoA derivatives and other valuable cofactors. © 2024 The Authors.

Using a variety of econometric techniques, the study seeks to uncover the impact of ESG disclosure on risk mitigation and its influence on stock market performance. Design/methodology/approach: Benchmark regression models were used to explore the associations between ESG disclosure, firm risk and stock returns. To address potential endogeneity, a generalised method of moments estimator is used. Quantile regression was used for robustness analysis. Findings: The study reveals a negative relationship between ESG disclosure and firm risk, indicating that companies with greater ESG disclosure tend to experience reduced risk exposure. In addition, a positive association is observed between ESG disclosure and stock market returns, suggesting that companies with more comprehensive ESG disclosure practices tend to perform better in the stock market. Research limitations/implications: This study implies that investors appreciate sustainable investment and incorporate ESG practices and disclosure in decision-making. Policymakers can promote transparent ESG reporting through regulatory frameworks, fostering sustainable practices in the energy sector. Originality/value: Despite the mounting concerns over carbon dioxide emissions and the energy industry’s environmental footprint, this study pioneers a comprehensive analysis of ESG disclosure within this critical sector. Delving into the relationship of ESG practices, firm risk and market returns, this research uniquely examines both risk mitigation and return enhancement, shedding new light on sustainable strategies in the energy domain. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."

In recent years, the transport sector has made strides in reducing its carbon footprint by producing electric vehicles that emit zero carbon. This paper investigates the use of Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs) with a newly developed regenerative suspension module (RSM). The RSM uses an electromechanical mechanism to obtain regenerative electrical energy from the engine and is mounted to the passive suspension system. To determine the potential energy savings of the RSM module, a hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle simulated under specific road geometries, speeds, and acceleration conditions. The simulation results indicate that the Regenerative Suspension Modules (RSM) mounted on each wheel of the FCEV generate 2.5 times more energy than the regenerative braking system.

Between 20% and 33% of healthcare waste originates from a hospital’s operating room, and up to 90% of waste is sent for costly and unneeded hazardous waste processing. The goal of this study was to quantify the amount and type of waste produced during a selection of common trauma and elective orthopaedic operations, and to calculate the carbon footprint of processing the waste. Methods Waste generated for both elective and trauma procedures was separated primarily into clean and contaminated, paper or plastic, and then weighed. The annual carbon footprint for each operation at each site was subsequently calculated. Results Elective procedures can generate up to 16.5kg of plastic waste per procedure. Practices such as double-draping the patient contribute to increasing the quantity of waste. Over the procedures analysed, the mean total plastic waste at the hospital sites varied from 6 to 12kg. One hospital site undertook a pilot of switching disposable gowns for reusable ones with a subsequent reduction of 66% in the carbon footprint and a cost saving of £13,483.89. Conclusions This study sheds new light on the environmental impact of waste produced during trauma and elective orthopaedic procedures. Mitigating the environmental impact of the operating room requires a collective drive for a culture change to sustainability and social responsibility. Each clinician can have an impact upon the carbon footprint of their operating theatre. © 2024 Royal College of Surgeons of England. All rights reserved."

Using a sample of listed non-financial US firms from 2002 through 2018, we find that CO2 emission plays a moderating role in reshaping the CSR-stock valuation nexus. Further analysis showed that our results are robust for using alternate proxies of CSR, CO2, additional control and methods to alleviate endogeneity concerns. Additionally, we explored how increasing carbon footprints reshape this association only for firms with strong governance structures.

A novel approach for manufacturing propellant tanks that reduces the need for machining and friction stir welding processes has been presented in this paper. This approach involves manufacturing a tank half starting from a single metal plate, using innovative and advanced metal forming processes such as hot stretch forming, magnetic pulse forming, hub forming, and integrated stiffened cylinder (ISC) flow forming followed by orbital welding of two tank halves. A life cycle assessment (LCA) study was conducted in accordance with ISO 14044:2006 standard using the ReCiPe 2016 Midpoint (H) method to compare the environmental impacts of the traditional and newly developed approaches for manufacturing propellant tanks. The results of the LCA study showed that the new approach based on advanced forming technologies reduced carbon footprint by 40%, cumulative energy demand by 35%, water footprint by 17%, and materials waste by 4% compared to traditional manufacturing. The lower environmental impact of the new approach was attributed to a decrease in friction stir welding requirements due to the implementation of advanced forming techniques that enable integrated tank production. This lowered the overall energy consumption in the novel approach by a factor of 1.5 and in turn resulted in lower environmental impact compared to traditional forging and machining-based method. Furthermore, a futuristic scenario that involves in-house tank production using the novel approach with minimal transportation of inventories was also simulated. Based on the LCA results, it was seen that the newly developed approach for manufacturing propellant tanks was more environmentally friendly than the traditional approach and its environmental footprint could be further reduced by implementing the futuristic scenario with minimal transportation. This novel approach is also expected to reduce the lead time and production cost of manufacturing a propellant tank. Hence, future efforts in cost assessment and further optimization of raw material and energy usage are recommended. © The Author(s) 2024."

Our results show that the biggest parts of the ecological footprint are in both study areas the carbon, the cropland and the forest components, in line with earlier calculations. On the whole, the ecological footprint values are bigger in the suburban study area (2.63 gha/capita) compared to the panel housing estates (2.29 gha/capita), mainly because of the differences between the carbon uptake and the built-up land components. Beyond comparing the ecological footprint values of different residential areas, the study also contributes to the literature by addressing the improvement options of the respective areas through a rough model calculation on the reduction opportunities in both cases, resulting 36 percent in case of panel housing estates, and 47 percent in the suburban areas. Although these values have to be considered cautiously, they show significant opportunities in ecological footprint reduction in both types of residential areas supported by individual motivations, as well as by policy measures. © 2024, Reasearch Centre for Astronomy and Earth Sciences Hungarian Academy.

Bioplastics derived from renewable natural resources have emerged as an eco-friendly substitute for conventional plastics, leading to a reduced carbon footprint and conservation of non-renewable fossil fuels. Seaweed is an attractive material for bioplastic production due to its abundant polysaccharide content, high biomass, rapid growth rate and suitability for consumption. This work aimed to explore the feasibility of producing seaweed bioplastics, specifically starch and carrageenan from Kappaphycus alvarezii, along with chitin extracted from ramshorn snails (Planorbarius corneus). The surface morphology of the bioplastics was assessed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and their biodegradability was also examined through a soil burial biodegradation test. Starch-based bioplastics incorporated with carrageenan and chitin exhibited a more substantial network structure, rougher surface texture and smaller void sizes with improved mechanical strength and water barrier properties. The bioplastics underwent decomposition, resulting in fragmentation into small pieces (with more than 76% weight loss) or complete degradation through the enzymatic activity of Acinetobacter spp. and Burkholderia cepacia. Therefore, seaweed-chitin-based bioplastics demonstrate their potential as a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional plastics. © Jiangnan University 2024."

This was performed by using global multi-regional input-output analysis and consumption-based accounting (CBA) - production-based accounting (PBA) ratio. In 2016, the annual CO2 emissions embodied in Indonesia's exports and imports were 114 and 95 Mt. CO2, respectively. Considering final demand only, these values reduce to 32 and 22 Mt. CO2 or 0.9 and 0.6 % of total CO2 emissions in global trade, respectively. The electrical and machinery sector makes up the most CO2 emissions in Indonesian exports. In terms of per USD, metal products and petroleum, chemical and non-metallic mineral products are among the most carbon-intensive sectors, thus likely to be affected by the CBAM policy. Furthermore, Indonesia's emissions under CBA were slightly lower than PBA, indicating that minor carbon leakage occurred in 2016, but this is subject to uncertainty. Assessing the relative CO2 emissions of various economic sectors is suitable for manufacturing goods whose processes are typically dominated by fossil combustion. However, this is not the case for the agriculture sector as its carbon footprint values are underestimated due to the exclusion of land use, land use change, and forestry emissions. Overall, our findings can serve as a baseline to further explore how a transition towards a low-carbon economy in Indonesia could improve global-trade carbon balances. © 2024 Institution of Chemical Engineers"

This study aims to assess the volume of plastic waste generated during total hip, knee, and shoulder arthroplasty in the OR and identify areas for improvement. Method: A prospective transversal study at a tertiary hospital was conducted. All total knee arthroplasty (TKA), total hip arthroplasty (THA), and reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) from April to July 2021 were included. The weight of plastic used during patient preparation, anaesthesia, and the surgical procedure was recorded. To calculate the environmental impact, a calculator generated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) was used. Results: A total of 68 surgeries were included. The mean weight of plastic used in total was 7.3 kg (SD 0.48), with the highest yielding procedure being TKA. It generated a mean of 7.63 kg (SD 0.28), followed by THA at 7.28 kg (SD 0.43), and RSA at 6.87 kg (SD 0.47). Various scenarios were simulated to evaluate the potential impact of reducing plastic waste. Substituting plastic wrapping with recyclable materials could save 159.6 kg of CO2 emissions per 100 prostheses. Eliminating non-essential equipment and adopting reusable fabric drapes also showed a significant potential. Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for environmentally sustainable practices in the OR. In this way, the healthcare sector can contribute to a cleaner and greener world without compromising patient safety. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to SICOT aisbl 2024."
42,Replacing location-based electricity consumption with market-based residual mixes in background data to avoid possible double counting: a quantitative analysis of effects and challenges,Article,Holzapfel P.; Bunsen J.; Schmidt-Sierra I.; Bach V.; Finkbeiner M.,International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment,29.0,2024,1279,1289,10.1007/s11367-024-02294-x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85191980546&doi=10.1007%2fs11367-024-02294-x&partnerID=40&md5=01462972fd92c29ba63a501008456d83,09483349,Scopus,Brightway 2; Carbon footprint; Double counting; Energy attribute certificates; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Market-based method; Residual electricity mix,"Purpose: Most life cycle inventory (LCI) datasets include location-based electricity mixes. Using these LCI datasets in combination with market-based electricity accounting in life cycle assessments (LCAs) leads to double counting of electricity from specific sources, such as renewable energy. The goal of this paper is to analyze market-based accounting by replacing location-based electricity consumption with market-based residual mixes in all processes of the ecoinvent database. The python script for this replacement procedure is openly available. Materials and methods: We use the Brightway 2 software package to replace European location-based electricity consumption in all 21,238 processes of the ecoinvent database with residual electricity mixes on the corresponding voltage level. The ecoinvent database provides residual electricity mixes for all countries involved in European trade with market-based energy attribute certificates—Guarantees of Origin. We analyze the induced changes to the database both on an individual process level and on a database-wide level. The analysis focusses on the impact category climate change but is further extended to the impact categories terrestrial acidification, freshwater eutrophication, marine eutrophication, ozone depletion, and particulate matter formation. Results and discussion: For European processes, the implementation of the residual electricity mixes leads to average changes in the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) results for climate change of 1%, 10%, 20%, and 50% for 2958, 733, 387, and 107 processes, respectively. Changes are especially pronounced for Norwegian and Icelandic processes due to the large differences among their location-based and residual electricity mixes. For the other analyzed impact categories, the changes in LCIA results are particularly high for freshwater eutrophication. With the push towards more primary data in LCA and GHG accounting, the impacts of using residual electricity mixes instead of location-based electricity mixes need further research on basis of quantified figures, which we present in this paper. Conclusion: This paper presents an approach towards enabling more consistent market-based accounting throughout LCAs and thereby contributes to the avoidance of double counting. Since only European residual mixes are considered, the database of this paper leads to distortion of LCA results. Further, research is needed to address double counting beyond the European electricity sector. This includes an expansion of this research to a global level and other industrial sectors. Furthermore, research is needed regarding industry-specific electricity sources in LCI datasets, which may also lead to double counting. © The Author(s) 2024."

However, the production of PBAT is carbon-intensive, as it relies on the use of petroleum-based monomers. There is, thus, significant interest in identifying polyesters that are biodegradable and less carbon-intensive (e.g., use of biomass-derived monomers). In this work, we develop a detailed process model (and an associated database) for the production of polyaliphatic-polyaromatic polyesters including petroleum-based PBAT and biomass-derived alternatives including poly(pentylene-adipate terephthalate) and poly(pentylene-adipate furandicarboxylate). Techno-economic analysis (TEA) reveals that the production costs of these polyesters strongly depend on monomer costs (accounting for over 90% of the total production cost) and identifies market conditions under which biomass-based polyesters can be cost-competitive to petroleum-based PBAT. Life cycle assessment (LCA) shows that biomass-derived polyesters can reduce the global warming impact of PBAT by half. Overall, the proposed TEA/LCA model aims to provide guidance into polyesters that are most promising and help assess their overall economic and environmental performance. © 2024 American Chemical Society"

The primary focus is on enhancing farming, fishing, and forestry activities with villagers. The Covid-19 pandemic presented significant challenges for the villagers, particularly in marketing their goods, resulting in financial hardships and an increased vulnerability to debt traps, particularly affecting women. Additionally, a major obstacle to achieving regenerative living is the limited access to land, with approximately 80% of the villagers either landless or owning small plots. Moreover, fishing restrictions imposed by the military to protect the Citarum River have further curtailed access to common grazing land for cattle. Preliminary analysis indicates that adopting intensive farming methods, such as rabbit breeding, mushroom cultivation, and fertiliser production, holds promise for reducing the community's carbon footprint. Overcoming these challenges and mapping pathways towards regenerative living are central objectives of this case study, providing insights and practical strategies to foster sustainable economic and environmental progress in Tarumajaya. Key components of the approach include finding markets for village products, extending access to common resources such as rivers, forests, and hillside terraces to villagers, and providing mentorship to women for supporting their small enterprises. The ongoing partnership with the village involves a community of practice consisting of universities and nongovernmental organisations, while private sector entities, including a gas company and tea and coffee plantations, are engaged in negotiations with the village head to secure additional land access. This study highlights the combination of challenges arising from the lack of access to common resources, limited market opportunities, and the influence of predatory financial institutions during the pandemic. By working closely with the villagers, the case study aims to identify opportunities and support the transition towards a green circular economy that moves away from business as usual and promotes regenerative living. © 2023 The Authors.

Restricted by competitive hydrogen evolution, achieving satisfied nitrate reduction performance in neutral media is still a challenge, especially for the regulation of this multielectron multiproton reaction. Herein, facile element doping is adopted to tune the catalytic behavior of IrNi alloy nanobranches with an unconventional hexagonal close-packed (hcp) phase toward NO3RR. In particular, the obtained hcp IrNiCu nanobranches favor the ammonia production and suppress byproduct formation in a neutral electrolyte indicated by in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry, with a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 85.6% and a large yield rate of 1253 μg cm-2 h-1 at −0.4 and −0.6 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), respectively. In contrast, the resultant hcp IrNiCo nanobranches promote the formation of nitrite, with a peak FE of 33.1% at −0.1 V (vs RHE). Furthermore, a hybrid electrolysis cell consisting of NO3RR and formaldehyde oxidation is constructed, which are both catalyzed by hcp IrNiCu nanobranches. This electrolyzer exhibits lower overpotential and holds the potential to treat polluted air and wastewater simultaneously, shedding light on green chemical production based on contaminate degradation. © 2024 American Chemical Society."

Design and implementation of new methodologies require limited resources and funding, and these resources are not equitably distributed on a global scale. Thus, we argue for more ecological uses of methodologies, especially in the context of data collection and interdependent relations of knowledge/information creation. Like the excessive use of energy sources, potentially unnecessary productions of new data, information, and evidence should not be regarded as unproblematic, let alone virtuous. Rather, qualitative researchers, funding agencies, and other bodies that evaluate research, should question whether new data, information, evidence are needed and at what cost. We also propose more data recycling, data sharing, open access data, and other ecological ways of supporting shared knowledge and monitoring excessive data production. © The Author(s) 2023."

Based on statistical data, the work presents an analysis of the dynamics of local and global emissions into the atmosphere in recent years and preventive measures to reduce them for decarbonization. The mathematical model is based on basic conservation equations that explain the liquid fuels combustion process in high turbulence. The paper outlines the outcomes of computational experiments that were carried out to determine the best conditions for the combustion of liquid fuels (petrol and heptane). The droplet injection rate in the combustion chamber at high turbulence was analyzed to determine the atomization and combustion processes. Optimum combustion parameters for petrol and heptane were identified. The temperature and dispersion characteristics of the fuel-air mixture, along with the concentration fields of combustion products such as CO2 and N2, and the aerodynamics of multiphase flow for two types of liquid fuels were determined through computational experiments. The optimum combustion modes for petrol and heptane were determined based on the attained results, which can facilitate rational fuel combustion, reduce the number of released harmful emissions, and enhance engine efficiency. Implementing the optimum parameters that were achieved for the combustion of hydrocarbon liquid fuels in the combustion chambers of actual heat engines will minimize the anthropogenic load on the surrounding atmosphere with the release of greenhouse gases, promote decarbonization in the energy sector, and reduce the carbon footprint. © 2024, al-Farabi Kazakh State National University.

With edge computing serving low-latency services, IoT makes intelligent energy management become a possibility, thereby enhancing the energy sustainability for energy systems. Currently, renewable energy is widely applied in energy systems to alleviate the carbon footprint. However, the instability and discontinuity of renewable generation decrease the quality of service (QoS) of edge servers. To address the challenge, a renewable prediction-driven service offloading method, named ReSome, is proposed. Technically, a deep-learning-based approach is designed for renewable energy prediction firstly. Next, the service offloading process is abstracted to a Markov decision process (MDP). With the predicted renewable energy amount, asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) is leveraged to determine the optimal service offloading strategy. Finally, by utilizing a real-world solar power generation dataset, the experimental evaluation validates the capability and effectiveness of ReSome. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021."

Given the lack of evidence for differences in surgical site infection (SSI) risk between the two, selecting the cap option with a lower carbon footprint may reduce the environmental impact of surgical procedures. However, many institutions continue to recommend the use of disposable bouffant caps. Methods: ISO-14044 guidelines were used to complete a process-based life cycle assessment to compare the environmental impact of disposable bouffant caps and reusable cotton caps, specifically focusing on CO2 equivalent (CO2e) emissions, water use and health impacts. Results: Reusable cotton caps reduced CO2e emissions by 79% when compared to disposable bouffant caps (10 kg versus 49 kg CO2e) under the base model scenario with a similar reduction seen in disability-adjusted life years. However, cotton caps were found to be more water intensive than bouffant caps (67.56 L versus 12.66 L) with the majority of water use secondary to production or manufacturing. Conclusions: Reusable cotton caps have lower total lifetime CO2e emissions compared to disposable bouffant caps across multiple use scenarios. Given the lack of evidence suggesting a superior choice for surgical site infection prevention, guidelines should recommend reusable cotton caps to reduce the environmental impact of surgical procedures. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

Environmental responsibility can then be assigned by distributing the carbon footprint in the network to each of these influential firms. The industrial services, including trading and manufacturing, and financial services industries were found to be the largest source of scope 3 emissions in the investment network. In particular, the influential role of financial firms is reflected by having the largest increase in carbon allocation after the adjustment.

Finding the most effective way to achieve emissions reduction via consumers behavioral change has recently raised policy-makers' interest but experimental evidence about this is still scarce. In this study, we examine the impact of individualized information about greenhouse gas emissions on grocery purchases. Using a randomized field experiment, we compare the effects of individualized information on the carbon footprint of grocery purchases to individualized information on grocery spending provided through a smartphone app. Compared to the spending information, the carbon footprint information decreases emissions from groceries by 27% in the first month of treatment, with 45% reductions in emissions from beef, the highest emissions food group. Treatment effects fade in the longer run along with app engagement but persist among those engaged with the app. Our results suggest that the provision of emissions information, in particular when paired with sufficient engagement, is a promising avenue for policies to turn food consumption greener. © The Author(s) 2024."

55,Hygrothermal Performance of Wooden Structures in Combination with Bio-Based Insulation in Future Climates in Belgium,Article,Blommaert A.; Van Den Bossche N.; Steeman M.,Journal of Sustainable Architecture and Civil Engineering,35.0,2024,95,102,10.5755/j01.sace.35.2.35995,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197299114&doi=10.5755%2fj01.sace.35.2.35995&partnerID=40&md5=71ae81a2ddd8d6702e926ce5169a34ad,20299990,Scopus,bio-based insulation; climate change; CLT; HAM simulations; wood frame construction,"In Europe, 40% of the total energy requirements relates to the energy consumption in the construction sector. The awareness resulted in the use of bio-based materials thanks to their small carbon footprint (Zhao et al. 2017). The aim of this study is twofold. The first objective is to gain a better understanding of the durability of traditional insulation materials such as mineral wool and PUR versus bio-based insulation (cellulose) in timber frame constructions and CLT constructions. The second objective is to evaluate to which extent this durability depends on various levels of climate change impact we might face based on the future greenhouse gas concentrations. This study uses the Mould Index as an indicator for possible degradation of the insulation layer. The mould Index is calculated using temperature and relative humidity derived from HAM simulations in Delphin 6.1.4. These simulations are done for different wall assemblies and different climate scenarios for Brussels. The results show that climate change has a negative effect on the durability of the outer part of the insulation material and that this effect is higher for cellulose than for mineral wool in timber frame construction. © Kaunas University of Technology."

It necessitates an analysis of the factors and consequences associated with these efforts. Therefore, this article aims to assess and analyze the factors and barriers influencing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction and the adoption of decarbonization strategies. Furthermore, it seeks to outline the development prospects of EU countries and Ukraine in the context of energy transformation and the achievement of sustainable development. The research findings highlight a trend of decreasing GHG emissions in both the EU and Ukraine from 2006 to 2022, despite the growing dynamics of GDP. In addition, an increase in the share of renewable energy and a decrease in energy intensity of the GDP of the studied countries have been observed. The energy and transport sectors are identified as the most difficult sectors for decarbonization, and therefore the implementation of hydrogen technologies in them is the most urgent. The interdependence between CO2 emissions, GDP volume, and energy intensity of GDP in European countries has been proven based on the results of regression analysis for the period of 2012-2022. The obtained dependency allows for predicting emissions in European countries, and the lower the energy intensity, the smaller the carbon footprint will be. The government policy of supporting low-carbon technologies, which manifests itself in the adoption and implementation of environmental legislation, in particular hydrogen strategies, is studied. Climate legislation provides a global framework for economic and social transformations to address global warming and transition away from fossil fuels. From 2022, the war in Ukraine has become a serious challenge for the sustainable development of Europe and affects carbon emissions and climate sustainability. Without achieving peace, it is impossible to achieve sustainable development. © 2024 by the author(s)."

In our comprehensive analysis, we incorporate ecological footprint, renewable energy, globalization, and technological innovations as exogenous variables. Employing a system of simultaneous equations across the BRICS panel, we aim to fully elucidate the proposed relationships. Our empirical findings underscore the following key insights: foreign direct investment, technological innovations, and the adoption of renewable energy sources significantly contribute to the mitigation of carbon emissions in these selected nations. However, it is essential to note that ecological footprints exhibit a positive association with carbon emissions, raising concerns on two fronts: escalating environmental degradation and increased land pressure, both of which contribute to rising ecological footprints in BRICS countries. Additionally, our analysis reveals that foreign direct investment is influenced by its capacity to reduce carbon emissions and bolster renewable energy adoption, while globalization amplifies investment trends within the BRICS nations. To address the environmental repercussions of mining activities, it is imperative to implement stringent control and regulation measures, given their potential adverse impacts, including soil pollution, acid mine drainage, erosion, biodiversity loss, excessive water resource consumption, and wastewater disposal challenges. Nevertheless, proactive steps such as recycling mining waste, adopting environmentally friendly mining equipment, combatting illegal mining, and enhancing overall mining sustainability offer promising avenues to mitigate the environmental footprint of mining operations. © The Author(s) 2023."

Digital twins for collection systems can help minimize the impacts of flow variation due to extreme weather events, attenuate flows to the WRRF, and reduce sewer overflows and the associated effects. Similarly, digital twins for WRRFs can help improve process, energy, and cost efficiency, fully utilise plant volumes, reduce carbon footprint, and support operator training. The current study provides an overview of two digital twin applications for collection systems (Future City Flow) and WRRFs (TwinPlant) and presents a first example of digital twin integration for proactive collection system-WRRF operation under wet-weather conditions. Current applications of the integrated digital twin are described, including (i) proactive implementation of wet-weather operation mode in WRRF based on inflow forecast and (ii) evaluation of the impacts of RTC in collection systems on WRRF performance. Other potential application examples are described together with the challenges related to the use of this solution.

Although primarily grown in western Canada, many pulse species——field pea in particular, are well suited to temperate growing conditions in the Maritime region of Canada. A study was conducted over 2 years at Harrington, Prince Edward Island, and consisted of four field pea varieties including two yellow varieties (AAC Lacombe and CDC Saffron) and two green varieties (CDC Limerick and CDC Raezer) planted at three plant population densities: 75, 100, and 125 plants m−2. The study also measured the effects of nitrogen fertilizer applied pre-plant (0 kg ha−1 vs. 15 kg ha−1) and applied plant available sulfur (0 kg ha−1 vs. 25 kg ha−1). Overall, yellow pea varieties were higher yielding than green pea varieties, and there was a linear increase in yield with increased seeding rate. There were no significant effects of pre-plant nitrogen fertilizer on yield, although it did slightly increase seed protein. Applied sulfur had a positive effect on yield and a slightly negative effect on thousand seed weight. This experiment provides a recommendation for the optimal seeding rate (100 plants m−2) and fertility recommendations to achieve profitable yields growing field pea in the Maritime region of Canada. © 2024 His Majesty The King In Right Of Canada As Repre-sented By The Minister Of Agriculture and Agri-Food."

Cradle to farm gate, cradle to processor’s gate, and cradle to consumer plate life cycle assessments were carried out to quantify greenhouse gases (GHG), resource use (i.e., water, land, and fuel), and potential water and air pollution (i.e., freshwater eutrophication, terrestrial acidification, and photochemical oxidants formation). Across the production chain, feed production had the greatest impact on most environmental indicators. The GHG intensity without dairy meat was estimated as 10.4 kg CO2-eq per kg of live weight (LW), corresponding to 32.8 kg CO2-eq per kg of consumed boneless beef. Including dairy meat reduced GHG intensity by 5.8% (0.6 kg CO2-eq kg LW–1) compared to when it was excluded. Other environmental metrics per kg of LW were 657 L, 38.7 m2 annual crop-eq, 0.4 kg oil-eq, 2.6 kg P-eq, 115.9 kg SO2-eq, and 8.7 kg NOx-eq for water use, land use, fossil fuel use, freshwater eutrophication, terrestrial acidification, and photochemical oxidants, respectively.

These components are critical to the efficiency and reliability of drilling operations, yet are susceptible to wear, leading to significant economic losses, operational downtime, and safety risks. Despite previous research on wear-resistant materials and surface treatments, gaps exist in understanding the unique properties of thrust pins and inserts. The aim of this study is to enhance mechanical system performance by characterizing the wear resistance of these components. Through chemical analysis, hardness assessments, and metallographic examinations, the study seeks to identify specific alloys and microstructures conducive to wear resistance. Key findings reveal that AISI 9314 thrust pins exhibit superior wear resistance with a tempered martensite microstructure and a hardness of 41 HRc, whereas AISI 9310 inserts are less resistant, with a hardness of 35 HRc. The research employs advanced techniques, including a pin-on-disc tribometer, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and profilometry, to evaluate wear behavior, visualize wear patterns, analyze elemental composition, and quantify material loss and surface roughness. Our findings demonstrate that optimizing the material selection can significantly enhance the durability and efficiency of drilling motors. This has profound implications for the oil and gas industry, offering pathways to reduce maintenance costs, improve operational efficiency, and contribute to environmental sustainability by optimizing energy consumption and minimizing the carbon footprint of drilling operations. © 2024 by the authors."

This experiment aimed to evaluate the effect of light-emitting diode (LED) lighting on the production of basil, mustard, and red cabbage seedlings under controlled artificial conditions and in a greenhouse as a supplementary lighting regime. Under controlled conditions, the experiment was conducted with basil seedlings, comparing LED light with two wavelengths (purple and white light). In a greenhouse, mustard and red cabbage seedlings were evaluated under natural light (regular photoperiod) and with supplementary purple lighting of 3 h added to the photoperiod. The variables assessed were aerial fresh mass (AFM), aerial dry mass (ADM), root dry mass (RDM), plant length (PL), and leaf area (LA). Basil seedlings grown under purple light showed greater length and AFM than those grown under white light, with no effect on the production of secondary metabolites. In the greenhouse experiment, red cabbage seedlings showed an increase in AFM, ADM, and DRM with light supplementation, with no effect on LA. AFM showed no statistical difference in mustard seedlings, but the productive parameters LA, ADM, and DRM were higher with supplementation. None of the evaluated treatments influenced the production of phenolic compounds and flavonoids in the three species evaluated. Light supplementation affected red cabbage and mustard seedlings differently, promoting better development in some production parameters without affecting the production of phenolic compounds and flavonoids in either plant. Thus, light supplementation or artificial lighting can be considered a tool to enhance and accelerate the growth of seedlings, increasing productivity and maintaining the quality of the secondary metabolites evaluated. Thus, this technology can reduce operational costs, enable cultivation in periods of low natural light and photoperiod, and cultivate tropical species in temperate environments in completely artificial (indoor) conditions. © 2024 by the authors."

Combination with cement-free binders, namely alkali-activated materials, is becoming increasingly important for sustainable development in the construction industry. This paper presents results relating to the potential use of waste carbon fibers in alkali-activated mortars. The waste carbon fiber fraction utilized in this research is difficult to integrate as reinforcement in ceramic–cementitious matrices due to its agglomerated form and chemical inertness. For this reason, a nanoceramic coating pretreatment based on nanoclay has been implemented to attempt improvements in terms of deagglomeration, dispersibility, and compatibility with alkali-activated materials. After chemical–physical and microstructural analysis on the nanoclay-plated fibers (including X-ray diffraction, IR spectroscopy, contact angle measurements, and electron microscopy) mortars were produced with four different dosages of treated and untreated waste fibers (0.25 wt.%, 0.5 wt.%, 0.75 wt.%, and 1 wt.%). Mechanical tests and fractographic investigations were then performed. The nanoclay coating interacts compatibly with the waste carbon fibers and increases their degree of hydrophilicity to improve their deagglomeration and dispersion. Compared to the samples incorporating as-received fillers, the addition of nanoclay-coated fibers improved the strength behavior of the mortars, recording a maximum increase in flexural strength of 19% for a fiber content of 0.25 wt.%. This formulation is the only one providing an improvement in mechanical behavior compared to unreinforced mortar. Indeed, as the fibrous reinforcement content increases, the effect of the nanoclay is attenuated by mitigating the improvement in mechanical performance. © 2024 by the authors."

However, temporally shifting workloads involves searching for periods with lower carbon intensity, which increases the workload's completion time. In this paper, we present CarbonScaler, a new approach that reduces carbon emissions of batch workloads without extending their completion time. Our approach relies on applications' ability to change their compute demand by scaling the workload based on fluctuations in energy's carbon intensity. We present a carbon-aware scheduling algorithm, a Kubernetes-based prototype, and an analytic tool to guide the carbon-efficient deployment of batch applications in the cloud. We evaluate CarbonScaler using real-world applications and show that it can yield 33% carbon savings without extending the completion time and up to 32% extra carbon savings over state-of-the-art suspend-resume policies when completion time is flexible.  © 2024 Owner/Author."

The incorporation of rigid CNF as a structural scaffold effectively improved the pore architecture of the aerogel, potentially providing substantial advantages for the infiltration and deposition of conductive materials. Additionally, the outstanding stability and flexibility exhibited by the aerogel in aqueous solutions suggest its significant potential for applications in flexible electrodes. Furthermore, electrochemical experiments showed that the rapid pathway formed between PDA and PEI could enhance the charge-transfer rate within the aerogel substrate. It is anticipated that such an enhancement would significantly benefit the electrochemical attributes of the electrode. Inspired by mussels, our introduced PDA-anchored rigid CNF into flexible polymer networks to fabricate aerogel substrates for electrode materials.

However, biohydrogen commercial uptake is now dominantly inhibited by the low hydrogen yield and process instability. In this work, Al2O3/BaFe2O4 nanoparticles (NPs) are successfully applied to anaerobic fermentation for investigating their effects on hydrogen yield, activity of bacteria and microbial community structure. The benefits of Al2O3/BaFe2O4 NPs with respect to microbial metabolism, reactivity of enzymes and process optimization are systematically researched through batch experiments. In addition, various characterizations are used to verify the physical and chemical properties of Al2O3/BaFe2O4 NPs. The results show that the activity of hydrogenases and microbe metabolism can be significantly inhibited by excess addition of Al2O3/BaFe2O4 NPs (150 mg/L and 200 mg/L) while the optimum addition 100 mg/L of Al2O3/BaFe2O4 NPs can boost the biohydrogen yield by 49% via facilitating microorganism growth and enhancing key enzymatic activities, which indicate that the Al2O3/BaFe2O4 NPs display a beneficial influence on electron transfer efficiency and process stability. The existence of Fe3+, Al3+and Ba2+ derived from the corrosion of Al2O3/BaFe2O4 NPs by organic acids synergistically improve the microbial transmembrane transportation and substrate utilization, which contribute to higher conversion rate of glucose into acetate, butyrate and H2. Meanwhile, the complementary functions of Fe3+ and Al3+ can powerfully shorten the lag phase and promote the glycolysis, which finally accelerate the dark fermentation process. Compared with the control group, Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 is selectively enriched by the addition of Al2O3/BaFe2O4 NPs, which keep heavily involved in the synthesis of H2. On balance, this study provides an effective strategy to enhance hydrogen productivity and maintain process stability, which offer the valuable information for the sustainable utilization of sewage sludge. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC"

The tool, known as “Return on the Environment” (EROI), is based on a widely accepted environmental assessment method and it calculates the Global Warming Potential (GWP100) incurred and avoided at various stages in the supply chain strictly related to RFID technology introduction. To validate the tool, two RFID deployments have been assessed: one involving a pharmaceutical product tagged on its secondary packaging to monitor the flow of products through the distribution channel, and another a medical device tagged on both primary and secondary packaging to oversee product flow from the supplier distribution center to the hospital operating theatres. In both cases, the results indicate that implementing RFID technology reduced GWP100 compared to the scenarios without RFID. This was primarily due to decreased product shrinkage, lower missing or expired products, and reduced additional transportation due to shipping errors. The tool is versatile and it could be applied to any type of product, serving as a source of inspiration for those who want to assess the sustainability of RFID technology not only from an economic perspective, i.e. ROI calculation, but also from an environmental view. Future work will address the third level of sustainability, RFID social sustainability, that is the impact RFID deployments may have on empowering people, improving staff and employees working conditions, and creating possibilities for high-value job opportunities. © 2024 – IOS Press.

The study is structured to help decision-makers access the necessary data related to the status of solar-energy infrastructure and power production in the study region. The study investigates current efforts to establish PV technology and the challenges hindering the development of this technology. These efforts and challenges are then benchmarked against their status in Australia, which has climate and landscape conditions similar to those of the countries in the study region. It was found that Australia is successfully adopting solar energy in households and industrial locations despite its historical reliance on fossil fuels for energy production. This offers a potential avenue for replicating the Australian model of PV development in the study region. This work also addresses the effect of natural and anthropogenic aerosols on the performance of the PV panels. Meanwhile, it also proposes a conceptual model to help local governments and decision-makers in adopting solar-energy projects in the study region. Additionally, a preliminary carbon-footprint analysis of avoided emissions from PV energy utilization compared to national grid intensity was performed for each country. Findings show that the countries in the study region have great potential for using solar energy to gradually replace fossil fuels and protect the environment. It is observed that more hours of daylight and clear-to-scattered cloud coverage help increase solar irradiance near the ground all year around. Dust and aerosol loadings, however, were found to greatly reduce solar irradiance over the GCC area, especially during large dust events. Despite the high potential for harvesting solar energy in the study region, only a handful of PV plants and infrastructural facilities have been established, mostly in the KSA, the UAE, and Jordan. It was found that there is a critical need to put in place regulations, policies, and near-future vision to support solar energy generation and reduce reliance on fossil fuels for electricity production. © 2024 by the authors."

Sustainable dietary patterns have proposed large reductions in red meats in particular. Foods with the potential to reduce the environmental impacts of diets are under increasing investigation, and cultured meat, produced by culturing animal cells, could play a key role, especially for diet transitions away from high red meat consumption. In this paper, the inclusion of cultured meat in optimized Danish diets is explored through minimizing climate impact in greenhouse gas emissions measured through Global Warming Potential (GWP) with ±30 %, 60 %, and 90 % stepwise changes from current diets while meeting nutritional requirements; the total consumer diet costs were also assessed. Three optimization models were run, one with a cultured meat diet (all animal-sourced meats are replaced with cultured meat), an omnivore diet (with conventional animal-sourced foods and no cultured meat), and a vegan diet (neither cultured meat nor other animal-sourced foods are allowed). Results revealed that both omnivore diets with and without cultured meat and vegan diets can achieve impact improvements compared to current diets. The greatest GWP reductions can be seen in the cultured meat diet (8.0 Mt CO2 eq./yr) and vegan diets (9.8 Mt CO2 eq./yr) with 90 % deviation in both from current diets. These reductions could represent potential Danish national emissions decrease of 21 % and 25 %, respectively, in 2022 impacts. Cultured meat diets resulted in the highest costs (11.58€/day) compared to the current diets (8.05€/day), vegan diets (6.49€/day), and omnivore diets (6.11 €/day). This paper provides key information about diet shifts and the potential of novel foods to reduce carbon emissions compared with the current diets. Although the socio-cultural acceptability and technological readiness of cultured meat, which represent crucial prerequisites to its inclusion in diets, still need to be assessed. © 2024 Institution of Chemical Engineers"

To develop sustainable lightweight geopolymer-based building materials useful as fire resistant thermal insulation materials, we added 5 and 10 wt% of discarded cork dust, a readily available industrial by-product, to metakaolin before and after the alkaline activation with sodium hydroxide 8 M and sodium silicate solutions. We followed the chemical, microstructural, antibacterial, and physical properties of the resulting composites for up to 90 days in order to monitor their long-term durability. The presence of cork does not interfere with the geopolymerization process and in fact reduces the density of the composites to values around 2.5 g/cm3, especially when added after alkaline activation. The composites resulted in chemically stable matrices (less than 10 ppm of cations release) and filler (no hazardous compounds released) with a bacterial viability of around 80%. This study provides valuable insights into the tailoring of discarded cork-based composites obtained by geopolymerization with a porosity between 32 and 48% and a mechanical resistance to compression from 15 to 5 MPa, respectively, suggesting their potential as durable interior panels with low environmental impact and desirable performance. © The Author(s) 2024."

This paradigm shift has made cloud computing a cornerstone of the contemporary digital economy, attracting substantial focus from both academic and industrial sectors. Its unique pay-as-you-go model provides customers with on-demand resource availability, enhancing operational flexibility. However, this convenience is offset by the growing energy demands of cloud data centers, which not only escalate operational expenses but also contribute to environmental degradation through increased carbon footprints. To combat these issues, Green cloud computing has been introduced, striving for energy-efficient and sustainable operations. This involves employing strategies that minimize energy consumption and resource utilization through the application of energy-conscious algorithms. Although numerous algorithms based on server consolidation have been proposed to optimize energy use in cloud environments, they often lack uniform evaluative comparisons and vary in performance due to differing experimental conditions. This variance presents a challenge in selecting the most effective algorithm tailored to specific needs. This study aims to provide a nuanced analysis of existing energy-efficient algorithms, assisting researchers in identifying the algorithm that best suits their requirements. We undertake an exhaustive comparison of various algorithms, examining their architecture, modelling approaches, and performance metrics. These algorithms are then implemented and tested under uniform conditions using the CloudSim toolkit.

The healthcare sector, whilst responsible for 4.4% of global net carbon emissions, has been slow in addressing its environmental footprint. This article explores the needs and challenges to achieve sustainable orthopaedic surgery. Orthopaedic surgery continues to create a large carbon footprint, primarily through the use of single-use consumables and energy-intensive operating theatres. While efforts to reduce environmental harm have primarily targeted changes within the operating theatre, a comprehensive approach must consider the entire surgical pathway. The principles of reduce, reuse and recycle are paramount. Reducing surgical caseload and advancing digital healthcare afford opportunities to streamline patient interactions, reduce travel emissions and improve efficiency. Furthermore, reevaluating routine practices, such as preoperative investigations and postoperative care, can minimize unnecessary resource consumption. Improving the sustainability of orthopaedics will bring conflicting clinical, financial and environmental challenges. However, with increasing awareness among healthcare professionals and support from it's professional bodies, there is growing momentum toward sustainable orthopaedic surgery. Transitioning to sustainable orthopaedic surgery neccesitates a broad approach encompassing prevention, optimization, and streamlining of the surgical pathway. Addressing environmental concerns alongside clinical outcomes is imperative for the future of orthopaedic surgery. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

These fibers, made of polyetherimide (PEI) polymer, have a completely amorphous structure, and can be dyed with disperse dyes, similar to how polyester fibers are dyed. This study focused on the reduction clearing process after dyeing PEI fibers with disperse dyes and examined various clearing agents used in both alkaline and acidic conditions, assessing how different concentrations, temperatures, and durations of reduction clearing processes affected the PEI samples. The main goal was to find the best reduction clearing parameters for disperse-dyed PEI samples, taking into account environmental impact, fabric durability, and color fastness. Analytical techniques like chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD5), total organic carbon (TOC), and carbon footprint analysis were used for evaluation. The study revealed that most disperse-dyed PEI fibers require a reduction clearing process, with few exceptions. It is important to note that clearing with sulfuric acid-based agents or in acidic conditions may slightly reduce the fiber’s strength. On the other hand, the study identified that utilizing a solution containing 2 g/l sodium dithionite and 4 g/l NaOH for 30 min at 70 °C resulted in the least strength loss.

Organic materials play an essential role in the degradation of the archaeological organism, while one of the significant dilemmas is identifying the media themselves. Most of these identification methods are destructive. We used a non-destructive analysis technique, namely infrared Raman spectroscopy, to prevent this drawback. The natural polymeric materials represented by hen egg yolk and white were studied as the widely used material starting from the eighteenth dynasty and in the Coptic period in Egypt regarding the interaction between degraded polymers of hen egg yolk and white and elucidate the mechanisms associated with thermally aging egg white and yolk samples. Raman spectroscopy gave valuable results that well illustrated the behavior of aged samples and the interactions between the media used, in addition to dynamic light scattering analysis, which was used to determine the size of proteins, nucleic acids and compounds, to monitor ligand binding, to understand the size of media particles and to draw the carbon footprint of yolks and whites of hen eggs in the steady state and after obsolescence, as these results helped us to preserve, treat and protect precious artifacts.. ©2024 National Information and Documentation Center (NIDOC)"
85,Unravelling life cycle impacts of coffee: Why do results differ so much among studies?,Article,Chéron-Bessou C.; Acosta-Alba I.; Boissy J.; Payen S.; Rigal C.; Setiawan A.A.R.; Sevenster M.; Tran T.; Azapagic A.,Sustainable Production and Consumption,47.0,2024,251,266,10.1016/j.spc.2024.04.005,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190087557&doi=10.1016%2fj.spc.2024.04.005&partnerID=40&md5=d15e33ea3649d0cbb9114a9d33dfb93e,23525509,Scopus,Agriculture; Carbon footprint; Coffee; Environmental impacts; Life cycle assessment,"Coffee beans are a major agricultural product and coffee is one of the most widely traded commodities and consumed beverages globally. Supply chains and cropping systems are very diverse, with contrasted potentials and performance, as well as environmental impacts. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies are needed to inform on reduction in impacts, but there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of the variability of existing LCA results and impacts of the cropping systems and their trade-offs along the supply chains. In an attempt to address this knowledge gap, the paper presents a systematic literature review of coffee LCA, considering a total of 34 studies covering 234 coffee systems. Global warming potential (GWP) was the impact category most reported in the literature, but the results varied greatly at both the farm and drink levels. For the former, the GWP values ranged from 0.15 to 14.5 (median: 3.6) kg CO2 eq./kg green coffee beans and for the latter the values ranged from 2 to 23 (median: 8.8) kg CO2 eq./kg consumed coffee in drinks. Main contributors to the GWP of production of green coffee beans were land use change (LUC), fertilisers and wet processing. However, there were great inconsistencies across studies in terms of LUC accounting, field emissions and wet process modelling. Green coffee beans production was also the main contributor to the GWP of coffee consumed, followed by brewing and coffee cup washing. Some studies covered other impacts, in addition to GWP. At both the farm and drink levels, fertilisers and pesticides were the main contributors to eutrophication and acidification, and to ecotoxicity, respectively. Brewing was the second main contributor at the drink level, in some cases the top contributor for energy-related indicators. Assumptions on packaging, cup washing and waste disposal were highly variable across studies. Water impact indicators were hardly comparable due to the system variability and method inconsistencies. Given the large diversity of coffee cropping systems worldwide, but also the diversity of possible coffee drinks, we recommend that LCA studies be standardised with respect to the definition of the functional unit, including consistent quality aspects for both green coffee beans (moisture) and coffee drinks (organoleptic properties). They should also be more thorough in detailing processes at all stages. More attention should be paid to the farming system complexity and a mass balance should be ensured when assessing biomass flows concerning LUC, co-products and residue emissions. Finally, more primary data would be needed to decipher the cropping system diversity, as well as to characterise emissions from all inputs to the field and bean processing, notably for wet and semi-wet processing. © 2024 The Author(s)"

The operating room has been highlighted as one of the highest contributors, prompting several initiatives by organizations focused on the care of hand and upper extremity conditions. This study aimed to quantify and compare the carbon footprint of a common hand surgery in two different surgical settings, the procedure room (PR) and operating room. We hypothesized that open carpal tunnel release (oCTR) will generate a greater environmental impact in the operating room than in the PR. Methods: This was a retrospective review of oCTRs performed at a tertiary care medical center. Current procedural technology codes isolated a single cohort of patients who underwent bilateral oCTR, one side performed in the PR and the contralateral side in the operating room. Current published emission conversions were used to calculate carbon footprint at our institution based on energy expenditure necessary for the creation and disposal of waste and sterilization of surgical equipment. Surgery time was combined with heating, ventilation and air conditioning/lighting energy consumption to estimate facility emissions. Results: Fourteen patients had bilateral oCTR surgery performed in both settings. Open CTR performed in the operating room generated 3.7 kg more solid waste than when performed in the PR. In total, emissions from oCTR performed in the operating room generated 32.4 kg CO2, whereas oCTR in the PR emitted 13.0 kg CO2 per surgery. Conclusions: Performing a common hand procedure (oCTR) is more environmentally sustainable in the PR than in the operating room, with a 60% reduction in carbon footprint. Clinical relevance: Greater effort should be made to perform surgery in the PR instead of the operating room in appropriately indicated patients. Surgical sets should be evaluated for the necessity of included equipment and unnecessary waste. © 2024 American Society for Surgery of the Hand"

In the present study, we aimed to quantify the CO2 equivalent (CO2eq) balance on annual basis of three farms with soybean‒maize crop systems in the state of Mato Grosso. Each farm had an areas with native vegetation and two other areas cultivated with soybean under no-till practices with different conversion times [2–5 years (S1) and more than 10 years (S2)]. Soil samples were taken to determine soil C stocks. GHG emissions were estimated for the 2020/2021 crop season according to the scope, GHG type, and source. The results showed that, on average, the soil total carbon (C) stocks under S1 and S2 underwent a 12% reduction relative to native vegetation (< 15 Mg ha−1), but they increased by 30% (> 22 Mg ha−1) with increasing time since conversion (S2 vs. S1). The scope 1 (direct emissions from the use of fuels in mobile and stationary implements when applying lime and nitrogen fertilizers, and from decomposition of crop residues) represented 67% of the total emissions, whereas the scope 3 (indirect emissions associated with the production of synthetic fertilizers, lime, fuels and seeds) were responsible 33% of the total GHG emissions on the three farms. On average, for the soybean‒maize farms, the observed GHG emissions (losses) were approximately 2.1 Mg CO2eq ha−1 yr−1, while soil C sequestration amounted to 4 Mg CO2eq ha−1 yr−1, resulting in a mean CO2eq balance of approximately -1.9 Mg CO2eq ha−1 yr−1. Our study showed that the sequestration of C in soil can be adopted in initiatives as a carbon dioxide removal strategy in agriculture systems. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024."

In addressing this, the focus is on preventive measures, as most risk factors for SSI are not controllable. Therefore, operating rooms are equipped with heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems to prevent airborne contamination of the wound, either through turbulent mixed air flow (TMA) or unidirectional air flow (UDAF). Aim: To investigate if the risk for SSI after cardiac surgery was decreased after changing from TMA to UDAF. Methods: This observational retrospective single-centre cohort study collected data from 1288 patients who underwent open heart surgery over 2 years. During the two study periods, institutional SSI preventive measures remained the same, with the exception of the type of HVAC system that was used. Findings: Using multi-variable logistic regression analysis that considered confounding factors (diabetes, obesity, duration of surgery, and re-operation), the hypothesis that TMA is an independent risk factor for SSI was rejected (odds ratio 0.9, 95% confidence interval 0.4–1.8; P>0.05). It was not possible to demonstrate the preventive effect of UDAF on the incidence of SSI in patients undergoing open heart surgery when compared with TMA. Conclusion: Based on these results, the use of UDAF in open heart surgery should be weighed against its low cost-effectiveness and negative environmental impact due to high electricity consumption. Reducing energy overuse by utilizing TMA for cardiac surgery can diminish the carbon footprint of operating rooms, and their contribution to climate-related health hazards. © 2024 The Authors"

This study considered the impact of weather conditions and carbon emissions on route decisions. These factors influenced travel time and rice quality, which can lead to delays, route changes, and increased supply chain costs. To account for weather conditions, the proposed model integrated historical weather data into route decisions. Additionally, the model incorporated carbon emissions as a significant factor in route decisions, aiming to reduce the environmental impact of transportation. This was achieved by considering vehicle fuel consumption and corresponding carbon emissions, optimizing route decisions to minimize the overall carbon footprint. The objective of this research was to develop a routing model that minimizes total costs while adhering to vehicle capacity constraints and customer delivery demands. Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) was proposed as an optimization method to solve the problem. Particularly, novel destroy and repair operators of ALNS were developed to specifically reduce the transportation cost, emission cost, and lost sales cost due to weather-induced damages. The results indicated that the proposed ALNS significantly decreased delivery expenses compared to the initial solution, achieving a 32% reduction in costs. The ALNS algorithm yielded superior outcomes compared to the standard LNS with lower objective and faster computing time. This research contributed to the development of sustainable supply chain practices in the rice commodity industry. The proposed approach provided a solution for MCVRP that considered weather conditions and carbon emissions while ensuring efficient commodity transportation. © 2024 Penerbit UTM Press.

Nanocellulose, with its bountiful sources and inherent properties, ranks top in the list of biofillers with a perspective of reducing the carbon footprint. A systematic study is required to understand the reinforcing effect of various types of nanocellulose. In the present work, we selected three types of nanocellulose, i.e., cellulose nanocrystal (CNC), cellulose nanofiber (CNF) and microfibrillated cellulose (MFC), to investigate the effect of geometrical structure on the properties of unvulcanized natural rubber (NR). Incorporating these fillers improved the tensile strength and modulus of natural rubber films significantly through reinforcement via filler network structure. The reinforcing effect of CNF was found to be higher compared to CNC and MFC, where an increase of 3.85 MPa in tensile strength from the neat sample was obtained. More uniform dispersion was evident through transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and Raman imaging for CNF in the rubber matrix. The structural properties were determined using Raman spectra and X-ray diffraction. The rheological studies revealed a good interaction between filler and NR. The work presented comprehensively compares different types of nanocellulose as reinforcing filler in NR matrix, which will help the researchers select an ideal type for their specific application and, thus, the proper usage of renewable resources, leading to sustainability and a circular economy. © BME-PT."

Recent literature has applied boundaries for climate change in different ways in life cycle assessment and there is a need for a systematic overview of these approaches, their compatibility with different types of assessments, and their effects on assessment results. This paper addresses that need by identifying and contrasting five approaches to operationalizing the climate change boundary and applying these approaches to a common case of the EU27 + UK consumption footprint in 2019. The identified operationalization approaches are found to be either static or dynamic. Static approaches enable comparison with a boundary which is constant through time, while dynamic approaches interpret the environmental sustainability boundary as a trajectory toward reaching net-zero emissions at the right time. When applying the five operationalization approaches to the 2019 consumption footprint of the EU27 + UK, we find that emissions reduction should be more ambitious than the current European Green Deal targets. For policymaking, the static approaches can offer a highly ambitious ideal reference aiding immediate action but can lack adaptability to evolving conditions. Dynamic approaches better address long-term goals and evolving knowledge but are more complex. This study contributes to the literature on absolute sustainability assessment by unravelling model choices and their implications for assessment results and policymaking. © 2024 by the International Society for Industrial Ecology."

The effect of other variables such as renewable energy, industrialization, and globalization was also controlled. The study applied the cross-sectional autoregressive distributed lag method (CS-ARDL), the augmented mean group (AMG), and common correlated effects mean group (CCEMG) methods as a robustness checks. The empirical findings reveal that circular economy and renewable energy have pro-environmental effects by decreasing carbon emissions and ecological footprint and increasing the load capacity factor in BRI countries. However, industrialization and globalization have detrimental effects on the environment. The result of causality shows a bidirectional causality between renewable energy, circular economy, industrialization, and three environmental indicators, but the relationship of globalization with CO2 emissions and the load capacity factor is unidirectional and with the ecological footprint is bidirectional. All the results are confirmed by the robustness tests. The study suggests policy implications for the BRI government. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024."

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is used successfully in dentistry to provide sedation and pain relief to anxious patients, most commonly in children. However, N2O is a powerful climate pollutant 298 times more damaging than carbon dioxide over a 100-year estimate. Methods: The functional unit chosen for this LCIA was 30 min delivery of N2O to oxygen in a 50:50 ratio at 6 L per minute flow rate as inhalation sedation to one patient. Two types of equipment were compared to deliver the anaesthetic gas: reusable and disposable items. Results: The use of disposable equipment for N2O sedation produces a significantly larger environmental impact across nearly all of the environmental impact scores, but the overall global warming potential is comparable for both types of equipment due to the vast environmental pollution from N2O itself. Conclusion: N2O sedation is a reliable treatment adjunct but contributes to climate change. Single-use equipment has a further deleterious effect on the environment, though this is small compared to the overall impact of N2O. Dental priorities should be to deliver safe and effective care to patients that protects staff, minimises waste and mitigates impact on the environment alongside promoting research into alternatives. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to European Academy of Paediatric Dentistry 2024."

This fossil-fuel power source has also increased the industry’s carbon footprint. As a solution to these problems, the objective of this work is to provide a sustainable and quality hybrid DC power supply system for BTS that would increase access to information and communication technology or ICT infrastructure. This involves the integration of solar & wind energy with the grid. The sizing of the hybrid sub-systems was designed & simulated using MATLAB Simulink to test for functionality. A prototype of the design system was then implemented with the results showing an average power output that guarantees 21 hours/day of supply. By installing this hybrid system of 1.3 kW, approximately 2.55 kg of diesel (C10H20) would be un-utilized by one BTS, thereby preventing 3.6 kg of CO2 from been emitted to the atmosphere daily. Extrapolating these values shows 930.75 kg of diesel can be saved and reduce 1314 kg of CO2 emission within a year. Hence eliminating the need for diesel-backup generator for a grid connected or non-grid BTS sited in rural areas. © 2024, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved."

Yet, few studies have considered if transient restrictions in dietary CP could reduce the environmental footprint of late-lactation cows. We hypothesized that the effects of CP feeding pattern on digestibility and environmental outputs would be amplified at lower dietary CP. We tested CP levels below and near predicted requirements (low protein [LP], 13.8%; high protein [HP], 15.5%) offered in 2 feeding patterns: where diets alternated ±1.8 percentage units CP every 2 d (oscillating [OF]) or remained static. Our study used a 2 × 2 factorial design with 16 mid- to late-lactation Holsteins (mean = 128, SD = 12 DIM), divided into rumen-cannulated (n = 8) and noncannulated subsets (n = 8). For each 28-d experimental period, we recorded feed intake and milk production and took samples of orts (1×/d) and milk (2×/d) for 4 d. For the cannulated subset, we measured and sampled from the total mass of feces and urine production and collected plasma 2×/d across 4 d. For the noncannulated subset, we sampled carbon dioxide and methane emissions 3×/d for 4 d. For each subset, we fit linear mixed models with fixed effects for CP level, CP feeding pattern, the interaction of CP level and CP feeding pattern, period, and a random effect for cow. For plasma and urinary urea-N, we conducted time series analysis. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found no evidence that dietary CP level and CP feeding pattern interacted to influence N balance, nutrient digestibility, or gas emissions. Results showed HP resulted in similar milk N but increased manure N, reducing N use efficiency (milk true protein N/intake N) relative to LP. For OF, urea-N in urine and plasma peaked 46 to 52 h after the first higher-CP phase feeding. Nutrient digestibility and gas emissions were similar across treatments, except CO2 production was greater for OF-HP. In summary, measured variables were minimally affected by dietary CP alternating ±1.8 percentage units every 48 h, even when average dietary CP was fed below predicted requirements (LP). Although our findings suggest that mid- to late-lactation cows are resilient to oscillation in dietary CP, oscillating CP neither reduced the environmental footprint by improving nutrient use efficiencies nor reduced the potential for direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions. © 2024 American Dairy Science Association"

The baseline findings were found to be robust to endogeneity test. Further tests revealed that higher carbon footprint emitted from PCON firms was more pronounced in advanced economies, and in carbon-intensive industries. However, the study found that stronger institutional governance could partially alleviate the significant and positive association between PCON firms and carbon footprint. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."
98,Carbon Footprint of Total Intravenous and Inhalation Anesthesia in the Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Procedure,Article,Yang L.; Hubert J.; Gitundu S.; Brovman E.; Cobey F.,Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia,38.0,2024,1314,1321,10.1053/j.jvca.2024.02.027,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188014978&doi=10.1053%2fj.jvca.2024.02.027&partnerID=40&md5=24635bb0ce3174b8eea5574e19d73050,10530770,Scopus,carbon footprint; inhalation anesthesia; TAVR; TIVA,"Objectives: To quantify and compare the emissions for deep sedation with total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and general anesthesia with inhaled agents during the transcatheter aortic valve replacement procedure. Design: A retrospective study. Setting: A tertiary hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. Participants: The anesthesia records of 604 consecutive patients who underwent the transcatheter aortic valve replacement procedure between January 1, 2018, and March 31, 2022, were reviewed and analyzed. Interventions: Data were examined and compared in the following 2 groups: general anesthesia with inhaled agents and deep sedation with TIVA. Measurements and Main Results: The gases, drugs, airway management devices, and anesthesia machine electricity were collected and converted into carbon dioxide emissions (CO2e). The carbon emissions of intravenous medications were converted with the CO2e data for anesthetic pharmaceuticals from the Parvatker et al. study. For inhaled agents, inhaled anesthetics and oxygen/air flow rate were collected at 15-minute intervals and calculated using the anesthetic gases calculator provided by the Association of Anesthetists. The airway management devices were converted based on life-cycle assessments. The electricity consumed by the anesthesia machine during general anesthesia was estimated from the manufacturer's data (Dräger, GE) and local Energy Information Administration data. The data were analyzed in the chi-squared test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test. There were no significant differences in the patients’ demographic characteristics, such as age, sex, weight, height, and body mass index. The patients who received general anesthesia with inhaled agents had statistically higher total CO2e per case than deep sedation with TIVA (16.188 v 1.518 kg CO2e; p < 0.001), primarily due to the inhaled agents and secondarily to airway management devices. For deep sedation with TIVA, the major contributors were intravenous medications (71.02%) and airway management devices (16.58%). A subgroup study of patients who received sevoflurane only showed the same trend with less variation. Conclusions: The patients who received volatile anesthesia were found to have a higher CO2e per case. This difference remained after a subgroup analysis evaluating those patients only receiving sevoflurane and after accounting for the differences in the duration of anesthesia. Data from this study and others should be collectively considered as the healthcare profession aims to provide the best care possible for their patients while limiting the harm caused to the environment. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."

Using industrial and natural pozzolans to reduce cement consumption and carbon dioxide footprint can be a crucial step in the industrial and economic development of UHPCs. In this study, by introducing ten mix designs based on UHPC and replacing 5%, 10%, and 15% by weight of silica fume with single pozzolans including slag and zeolite separately and a combination of percentages of both pozzolans as a silica fume replacement up to 15% by weight, various tests, including evolutions in internal temperature, setting time, compressive strength, and electrical resistivity in early and higher ages and final water absorption were performed on the specimens. The test results revealed that each of the pozzolans exhibits a different behavior during the hardening period, early and higher ages. In addition, a strong mathematical correlation was found between the results of various mechanical and durability tests. Slag and zeolite in amount of 5% cement weight in the mix designs, acquired the best results in terms of mechanical and durability properties, and percentages of 15% in single and complex conditions gave relatively lower results. The microstructural evaluation of the two optimal designs showed the increased compaction and improved C.S.H. growth due to pozzolan replacement with silica fume. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."

However, practical applications of wastewater-grown algal biomass have social acceptability issues in the food and feed industries due to unexpected threats (such as human/animal pathogens and toxins) associated with the wastewater-grown biomass. Therefore, considering the substantial pollutant removal potential of microalgae and the abundance of wastewater as a growth media, alternative bioprocessing routes of the wastewater-grown biomass should be developed. This review highlights some non-food and non-feed applications of wastewater-grown algae biomass. Recent Findings: Wastewater-grown algal biomass contains high amounts of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids depending upon the composition of wastewater and algal species grown. These three significant metabolites are precursors to bioenergy and biomaterial products such as bioethanol, biogas, and bioplastics. Hydrolysis of the wastewater-grown algal biomass can be easily improved to enhance the microbial fermentation yields to produce bioethanol and biobutanol. Fresh algal biomass, residual biomass, or both can be used as feedstocks in anaerobic digestion/co-digestion to produce biogas. Depending upon the selected species, wastewater-grown algal biomass can also produce biopolymers whose productivity depends on growth conditions, wastewater composition, and biopolymer synthesis method. Enzymatic, eco-friendly chemicals and mechanical approaches used to prepare biopolymers from algal biomass should be optimized for higher yields of biopolymers. Summary: Although wastewater-grown biomass has acceptability issues, it offers certain environmental benefits, including atmospheric carbon capture, phycoremediation of pollutants, and water recycling. This manuscript highlights the recent progress and emerging trends of wastewater-grown algal biomass as a feedstock with potential applications for fermentation, anaerobic digestion, and bioprocessing to produce clean energy and bioplastics.

In this context, alternative fuels have shown great potential in terms of achieving cleaner combustion and compliance with ever increasing pollutant emissions regulations. This work is focused on the study of two promising alternative fuels as Hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), which is a biofuel and Dimethoxymethane also termed as OME1, which is an e-fuel. A comprehensive numerical approach has been followed to study these fuels. Primarily a compact reaction mechanism having 121 species and 678 reactions has been developed which can be utilized to perform 3D CFD simulations of blends of these fuels. Secondly, a detailed numerical investigation including combustion and emissions analysis has been carried out. Results show that the developed mechanism is able to offer predictions, which match the experimental behavior observed in various combustion parameters and thus can be utilized for compression ignition engine applications involving these promising fuels. In addition, the numerical analysis also highlights that a reduction of 50% and 37% in terms soot and NOx emissions respectively can be achieved by addition of 30% OME1 in the blend containing HVO, suggesting that these blends can be utilized in unmodified CI engines to break the soot-NOx tradeoff without significantly penalizing the energy loss. © IMechE 2024."

Establishing low-carbon pilot cities exerts both actual and exemplary effects in decreasing its CO2 emissions. However, research in the field of low-carbon measures has frequently bypassed their particular effects on sectors with high emissions, such as the hospitality industry. This study seeks to fill this void by assessing the influence of low-carbon city pilot policies (LCCP) on the hotel sector's carbon footprint. The analysis uses a PSM-DID model to review emission data across 49 prominent tourist cities in China over the period 2010–2020. It contrasts emission patterns between pilot and non-pilot cities. Findings reveal that LCCP markedly cuts CO2 output in hotels. This cutback stems from sectoral change, the growth of higher-rated hotels, and enhanced hotel occupancy rate. The policy's effects are especially strong in affluent regions and international tourist cities. These results point to LCCP's crucial contribution to sustainable hotel practices. The study emphasizes the necessity for precise environmental regulations in energy-intensive industries to meet wider sustainability objectives. © 2024 The Authors"

It reports on a bibliometric analysis of the relations between climate change and circular economy, and it provides evidence and assessments based on a sample of 11 large companies in the chemical industry. The results show that there is a concern in the academic literature to discuss circular economy efforts to combat climate change, reduce carbon emissions, strengthen the supply chain, assess the life cycle of products, their environmental impact, and waste management, and identify barriers to implementing the circular economy. In addition, there is a close association between the CE concept and tackling climate change in how organisations report their practices to the stakeholders, in considering concepts of recycling, reusing, adopting renewable energy, seeking resource efficiency, and rethinking strategies. The study concludes by providing some suggestions that may assist companies in intensifying their efforts to reduce their carbon footprint, combining them with more circular business models. Efforts from interested stakeholders must focus on defining CE in a more detailed manner, as well as its implementation at the different stages of production and consumption, especially in operations for which no uniform approach or common practice can be established. In this context, implications for positive social and environmental impacts by promoting a faster and more proactive climate transition in the chemical sector are presented. The novelty of this paper relies on the fact that it advances knowledge on matters related to the circular economy under a climate change context, identifying current trends and suggesting some measures which may optimise current business practices of the chemical sector. © 2023 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

From a global warming perspective, in 2018, Iran was the seventh-highest greenhouse gas emitter in the world. An implementation should demonstrate that it is possible to estimate the environmental impact of climate change. A simple carbon footprint estimation model for waste-to-energy power plants with a life cycle assessment using the 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines is presented in this study. For this purpose, first the system boundary is determined. Then, the total emissions of each part within boundary are identified in terms of total greenhouse gas emission (and expressed in mass of carbon dioxide equivalent). In conclusion, the carbon footprint of generating one kWh of electricity is estimated. The final emission of the Tehran power plant is calculated at 24.46 ktCO2eq/year. Thus, the carbon footprint is estimated to be 1351.94 g CO2eq/kWh. Key parameters that affect carbon footprint are divided into two groups: emission parameters and electricity generation parameters. The sensitivity analysis of effective parameters showed the distance travelled and weight of waste transported during waste transportation, the fossil carbon content in waste composition has the highest effect on carbon footprint. The study shows a 1.2-fold difference between the carbon footprint of two current scenarios of waste treatment: landfill and waste-to-energy plant. The life cycle emissions of landfills exceed of waste-to-energy plants, indicating that these systems can contribute significantly to addressing the current environmental challenges. Additionally, they offer advantages in terms of electricity generation. © 2024 The Authors"

The call for global sustainability heightens the criticality of digital economy which is recently evolving in environmental empirics. This study provides the first empirical evidence advancing the symmetric effects of eco-digitalization, green technology, green finance, and renewable energy on environmental sustainability in China within the novel STIRPAT model. The study explores the ARDL model to evaluate the stated hypotheses based on quarterly data from 1995Q1 to 2019Q4. The preliminary analyses reveal the vulnerability of the Chinese environment to surging greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Besides, the structural break unit root anchored on Zivot–Andrew reveals prominent breakpoint years. The essential roles of urbanization and affluence are empirically investigated. Robustness checks on the long-run impacts are conducted based on FMOLS, DOLS, and CCR coupled with the causality analysis examined based on Toda–Yamamoto estimator. The findings uncover that eco-digitalization, green technology, green finance, and renewable energy promote environmental sustainability in China by mitigating CO2 emissions and ecological footprint. Conversely, urbanization and affluence escalate both pollutants. Further, causalities running from bidirectional to unidirectional nexuses among the variables are well documented. Policy insights that drive the paths to sustainability in China are suggested based on the findings. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023."

However, the huge cost of the abstracts limits its massive production. This study investigates the viability of bakery waste oil (BWO) as an economically efficient and environmentally sustainable feedstock for SLs production. Although such waste valorisation minimizes the use of first-generation substrates, the systematic environmental impacts need to be assessed as the waste streams may introduce different materials and processes. For this reason, a dynamic life cycle assessment (dLCA) was employed to iteratively assess the environmental impacts of SLs production as technology evolved. To facilitate the comparison between each traversal, the functional unit (FU) is defined as the production of 1 kg of crude SLs. SimaPro software and Ecoinvent v3.5 database were used to perform the dLCA. Cumulative energy demand (CED), global warming potential (GWP), and ReCiPe 2016 Midpoint (H) methods were used as indicators. Surprisingly, this analysis reveals that the use of BWO as a feedstock for SLs production (15,803.3 MJ of CED and 1277.3 kg CO2 eq. of GWP) does not consistently lead to reduced environmental impacts compared to first-generation feedstocks like oleic acid (11,898.3 MJ of CED and 959.6 kg CO2 eq. of GWP). Then different pH regulators were added to improve the bioprocess and reduce the environmental impacts. Notably, the introduction of potassium hydroxide (KOH) as a pH regulator significantly decreased environmental footprints, with results showing a CED and GWP of 9301.1 MJ and 751.7 kg CO2 eq., respectively. In contrast, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) exacerbated these impacts, resulting in a higher CED (19,741.6 MJ) and GWP (1595.6 kg CO2 eq.). ReCiPe Midpoint results confirmed that the use of BWO significantly reduced the environmental impacts of chemicals, especially the first-generation feedstock, under the regulation of KOH. Finally, a comparison was made between the use of BWO and food waste as substrates, demonstrating that BWO has a greater potential for reducing environmental impact. Moreover, the study recommends that combining BWO and food waste, along with other productivity-enhancing techniques like fed-batch fermentation and in-situ separation, will further enhance the sustainability of SLs production. The findings from the dLCA framework provide valuable insights for achieving sustainable SLs production, simultaneously enhancing SLs yield and environmental friendliness. This study highlights the effectiveness of dLCA as a method to track and analyze emerging technologies, guiding them toward a sustainability pathway. © 2024"

Through its resonant properties of peak wavelength, amplitude, and quality factor (Q factor), changes in concentration can be quantified within seconds and monitored over days with great stability. In addition, the small footprint, low cost, and high sensitivity are ideal properties for a disposable sensor that can be utilized in extreme environments. The large Q factor of the resonant cavity enables long interaction lengths and amplifies the effect of small changes in the background refractive index, which is detectable in picometer shifts of the resonance wavelength. However, this measurement is susceptible to changes in other environmental factors such as temperature, pressure, and humidity, which manifest on the picometer wavelength scale, reinforcing the need to decouple the variables. In this work, we compare the spectral response of different diameter resonators to carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and its mixtures, observing the spectral shifting and broadening of the cavity resonance near 1550 nm. In addition, the effect of environmental temperature on spectral shifting due to the thermo-optic effect is characterized and quantified. Lastly, the gas concentrations are changed in real time to showcase the tracking and recovery capabilities of the resonator sensor. © The Author(s) 2024."

In this study, an analysis of the carbon footprint has been carried out, including the main elements during the construction phase of a tunnel employing a tunnel boring machine (TBM). The research proposes several options for an easy and quick calculation of CO2 generation in a design phase. Its determination can be crucial for decision-making before and during the execution of any tunnel in the near future. The estimation models have been validated based on real case studies, defining the carbon footprint of each construction element. The proposed procedure can apply to any tunnel. However, it should be noted that it is an approximate analysis, and the limitations described in each section should be considered. The main CO2 generator found in the construction process is the lining element; the percentage varies between 50% in tunnels with smaller diameters (4–5 m) and 75% for tunnels with larger diameters (9–10 m), followed by the auxiliary elements, 16%, and the operation of the tunnel boring machine itself, 11.2%, while the other parts remain in a range between 1.3 and 5.7%.

European directives stress the importance of enhancing existing buildings to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. An approximately 100-year-old wooden apartment building in the heritage conservation area in Võru, Estonia, was designed as a nearly zero-energy building (nZEB). This study examined the impact of different renovation scenarios, considering both embodied and operational carbon emissions. During the study, the technical requirements of the National Heritage Board were developed in several aspects. The results of this study indicate that it is possible to renovate buildings in heritage conservation areas and achieve great energy performance. In addition to improving energy performance, it is possible to make the restoration of a significantly damaged exterior with intermediate repairs more cost-effective for the owner. Deep renovation of a historical wooden building decreases its carbon footprint as it leads to more energy-efficient renovation solutions. This is because operational emissions dominate over embodied emissions in a cold climate. From an environmental perspective, it is more feasible to renovate historically valuable buildings more deeply than it is to upgrade the external appearance of buildings. Renovation work to achieve an nZEB building should include insulating the thermal envelope while restoring the historical appearance and preserving the original building profile. In conclusion, this study offers a comprehensive analysis of various scenarios, including carbon footprint, energy performance, and cost optimality, related to different renovation strategies for buildings located in heritage conservation areas. There is a need to align heritage board technical requirements with the environmental perspective. Given that major renovation is more cost-effective and better at preserving the exterior appearance compared to staged renovation, the former should be preferred to ensure the owner's willingness to pay. © 2024 The Authors"

A comprehensive analysis and design process encompassing parametric variations in the span, roof pitch, and bay spacing was performed. The findings revealed that span size significantly impacts total embodied carbon, aligning with expectations. Smaller spans exhibit higher material use efficiency, contributing to a reduced carbon footprint per unit area. Roof pitch variations have a minimal influence on embodied carbon, emphasizing the robustness of steel structures across different pitch angles. This study also highlights the critical role of bay spacing, demonstrating that smaller spacing results in lower embodied carbon, highlighting the importance of efficient material utilization. Interestingly, an optimal range for carbon intensity per unit area was identified, providing nuanced insights into the sustainable design of warehouses. This research advances the understanding of embodied carbon in steel structures and offers practical recommendations for optimizing warehouse design. The findings contribute to the broader discourse on sustainable construction practices, guiding industry professionals, architects, and policymakers toward more environmentally conscious decisions in the realm of steel structure design and construction. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."

This proposal was evaluated via three objectives: (1) synthesise literature studies documenting the effectiveness of geological minerals at mitigating GHG emissions; (2) quantify, via meta-analysis, GHG magnitudes that could be abated by minerals factoring-in the carbon footprint of the approach; and (3) estimate the global availability of relevant minerals. Several minerals have been effectively harnessed across multiple sectors—including agriculture, waste management and coal mining—to mitigate carbon dioxide/CO2 (e.g., olivine), methane/CH4 (e.g., allophane, gypsum) and nitrous oxide/N2O (e.g., vermiculite) emissions. High surface area minerals offer substantial promise to protect soil carbon, albeit their potential impact here is difficult to quantify. Although mineral-based N2O reduction strategies can achieve gross emission reduction, their application generates a net carbon emission due to prohibitively large mineral quantities needed. By contrast, mineral-based technologies could abate ~9% and 11% of global CO2 and CH4 anthropogenic emissions, respectively. These estimates conservatively only consider options which offer additional benefits to climate change mitigation (e.g., nutrient supply to agricultural landscapes, and safety controls in landfill operations). This multi-benefit aspect is important due to the reluctance to invest in stand-alone GHG mitigation technologies. Minerals that exhibit high GHG mitigation potential are globally abundant. However, their application towards a dedicated global GHG mitigation initiative would entail significant escalation of their current production rates. A detailed cost-benefit analysis and environmental and social footprint assessment is needed to ascertain the strategy’s scale-up potential. © The Author(s) 2024."

With the advancement of science and nanotechnology, nanomaterials have been introduced to geotechnical material enhancement owing to their distinctive structures and great characteristics. Among various nanomaterials, Nano-SiO2 has been studied for more than a decade and has shown encouraging results for its usage as a ground improvement. The present work provides a comprehensive review of the physical parameters, strength characteristics, hydraulic conductivity, durability, and dynamic characteristics of soil employing Nano-SiO2. Furthermore, in order to better understand the underlying mechanism, cost-effectiveness, environmental concerns, and applications of the geomaterials treated with silica nanoparticles were studied. According to research, a small fraction of silica nanoparticles significantly alters the soil properties owing to their greater specific surface area and strong reactivity. Also, the amorphous silica particles are less harmful than the crystalline silica polymorphs. However, research on the silica nanoparticles used for soil enhancement is particularly promising and has the potential to strengthen the interaction between sustainable development and civil engineering through novel methodologies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Indian Geotechnical Society 2024."

Here, a comprehensive biomass-to-acetylene process was constructed that integrated several units including biomass pyrolysis, oxygen-thermal CaC2 fabrication and calcium looping. For comparison, a coal-to-acetylene process was also established by using coal as feedstock. The carbon efficiency, energy efficiency and environmental impacts of the bio-based calcium carbide acetylene (BCCA) and coal-based calcium carbide acetylene (CCCA) processes were systematically analyzed. Moreover, the environmental impacts were further evaluated by applying thermal integration at system level and energy substitution in CaC2 furnace. Even though the BCCA process showed lower carbon efficiency and energy efficiency than that of the CCCA process, life cycle assessment demonstrated the BCCA (1.873 kgCO2eq kg-prod−1) a lower carbon footprint process which is 0.366 kgCO2eq kg-prod−1 lower compared to the CCCA process. With sustainable energy (biomass power) substitution in CaC2 furnace, an even lower GWP value of 1.377 kgCO2eq kg-prod−1 can be achieved in BCCA process. This work performed a systematic analysis on integrating biomass into industrial acetylene production, and revealed the positive role of biomass as raw material (carbon) and energy supplier. © 2022 Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences"

During the Leaders’ Climate Summit, the US president articulated precise targets for combating climate change, notably a 50 to 52 percent reduction in net CO2 emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. Consequently, it becomes imperative to identify the pivotal factors that are driving this intensified dedication to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Hence, it is vibrant to determine the basic causes propelling the intensified interest in meeting SDGs 7 and 13. From this perspective, this study explores the dynamic link between energy transition, fossil fuel energy, green innovation, and economic complexity index on CO2 emissions and ecological footprint in the United States from 1980 to 2020. The dynamic Autoregressive-Distributed Lag (ARDL) simulations and Frequency Domain Causality (FDC) techniques are applied for long-medium and short-run causal association among the variables. Our empirical evidence shows that energy transition, fossil fuel energy, and economic complexity increase CO2 emissions and ecological footprint. On the other hand, green innovation reduces CO2 emissions and ecological impact only in the long term. The pragmatic outcomes suggest that authorities should inhibit Fossil Fuel Energy, concentrate on energy transitions, and include more renewable sources in the US energy mix. The findings would assist the United States in meeting SDGs 7 and 13. © 2024 International Association for Gondwana Research"

The efficient production of bio-jet fuels depends on the identification and characterization of eco-friendly and sustainable feedstocks. Brassica carinata (Arun Braun) cultivars are among the most significant industrial oilseeds that can be utilized as alternative feedstocks in the aviation industry. The study thoroughly evaluated four non-food Brassica carinata cultivars that are indigenous to Ethiopia to determine their suitability as substitute feedstocks for the production of bio-jet fuel. The effects of solvent extraction parameters were studied using response surface methodology with Box-Behnken design in an isothermal batch reactor. Physicochemical characterization, fatty acids profiling, ultimate analysis, analysis of metals and phosphorus concentration, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy characterization, and calorific value analyses were performed to characterize the properties of oils. Accordingly, oil yields ranged from 35.93 to 45.25%. Erucic acid (EA) was the most predominant fatty acid in all oils, accounting for 42–50%, of Derash and Yellow Dodolla oils, respectively, making Yellow Dodolla oil a super-high erucic acid oil. In comparison to the other oils, Yellow Dodolla was observed to be the least oxygenated oil, with a 7.80% oxygen content and oxygen to carbon ratio of 0.07, which may enable it to consume a very limited amount of hydrogen gas during hydrodeoxygenation in bio-jet fuel production. It was determined that, except for calcium and phosphorous levels in Tesfa, the concentrations of the metals and phosphorous were very small. Alkanes, alkenes, carboxylic acids, esters, alcohols, aromatics, and olefins were among the most significant and main functional groups identified. Our extraction and characterization results revealed that the Brassica carinata cultivars have very high oil contents, better physicochemical properties, excellent fatty acid profiles, and very low concentrations of heteroatoms (nitrogen, sulfur), metals and phosphorous concentrations, and very low level of oxygen to carbon ratios, making the oils, notably Yellow Dodolla oil, very high quality and promising alternative feedstocks for upgrading of the oils into bio-jet fuels through hydroprocessing pathway. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2022."

Despite constituting nearly three-quarters of global carbon emissions, the influence of household consumption choices on a region's carbon footprint is often neglected. While assessments at a regional or city scale may prove too broad for targeted mitigation strategies, estimating carbon emissions at the neighbourhood scale can foster sustainable and resilient urban areas. However, challenges arise in estimating emissions at this scale due to the availability of aggregated data, insufficient cross-sectoral data integration, and a lack of practical visualisation tools, causing policymakers to overlook the impact of household choices on neighbourhood carbon footprints. Therefore, the present article provides insights into the ongoing early-stage development of using urban digital twins to model, simulate, analyse, and visualise the impact of household consumption choices on neighbourhood-scale consumption-based carbon emissions. By exploring”what-if” scenarios, this research also seeks to forecast emission profiles based on how household consumption choices influence a neighbourhood's carbon emissions under future climatic and demographic conditions. © Author(s) 2024.

Concrete truss systems on the other hand have not been widely used in the construction industry because of its weak strength in tension. In this study, a concrete truss system prestressed with a conventional prestressing system and shape memory alloy (SMA) is proposed, and its sustainability is evaluated by estimating the embodied carbon footprint of the proposed system. The bottom concrete chord of the Howe truss is prestressed with conventional high-strength steel (HSS) reinforcement using mechanical tensioning, and the vertical elements are prestressed with SMA bars. The embodied carbon footprint of the FeMnSi SMA bar is evaluated by comparing it with the HSS reinforcements in chemical components and manufacturing processes. The concrete truss is designed and numerically validated for the concrete bridge girder application to satisfy the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) service and strength limit states. The designed concrete truss satisfies the AASHTO service and strength limit states with 37.3% less total weight and 25.9% less carbon emissions than the reference model, which is as per the AASHTO type 2 I-girder. © The Author(s) 2024."

Tar abatement is a critical process in product gas upgrading since tars compromise downstream processes and equipment, for this, membrane technology for upgrading syngas quality is discussed in this paper. Microchannel reactor technology with the design of state-of-the-art multifunctional catalysts provides a path to develop decentralised biomethanol synthesis from biogenic residues.

In this scope, firstly ball milling of the flue dust with citric acid is applied and then in situ carbonization conditions are optimized by pyrolyzing the mixture at different temperatures (600 °C and 750 °C) and times (4 h and 6 h). Every sample delivers capacities greater than graphite. Structural, morphological, and chemical characterization results demonstrate that the designed method not only promotes the formation of a nanometer-thick carbon layer formation over the particles but also induces partial phase transformation in the structure. The best performance is achieved when citric acid is used as the carbon source and the ball-milled powder is treated at 600 °C for 4 h in nitrogen (C6004): It delivers 714 mAh g−1 capacity under a current load of 50 mA g−1 after 100 cycles. This research is expected to set an example for the utilization of different industrial wastes in high value-added applications, such as energy storage.

Iran is one of the top CO2-emitting countries. However, there have been limited efforts in studying the Iranian population’s knowledge of global warming, their concerns about its consequences, and their support for a decarbonized economy. In this work, we study climate change awareness and the support for decarbonization among university students in Isfahan Province. Isfahan is one of the most populated and developed provinces in Iran. Therefore, understanding the awareness and willingness to act among the educated young generation adults in this province is critical in assessing plans to mitigate climate change in Iran. We present a correlation analysis between students’ backgrounds (age, gender, economic background, and level of education) and their concerns about climate change consequences and their support for a transition toward a decarbonized economy. The results show that most surveyed students (N = 388) agree that global warming is a concerning issue. Moreover, most students have taken some actions in their personal lives to reduce their carbon footprint. However, the support for policies to prevent climate change was not as strong among the students. Our analysis shows younger students have higher support for climate actions. Moreover, female students are more aware of the climate crisis and its consequences. © AESS 2024."

The bamboo culms are available with different spacing of knots, which has an effect on the physical and mechanical characteristics of the bamboo. Bamboo possesses significant tensile strength in the range of 100–250 N/mm2 along the fibers. In the present study, effect of spacing of knots in bamboo (Bambusa Vulgaris sp.) on flexural strength of Bamboo Reinforced Concrete (BRC) slabs is studied. Four variations in spacing of knots of bamboo were chosen for the study, BRC slabs of size 1.2 m × 0.45 m × 0.06 m of M20 concrete grade were cast for each variation of knots spacing. The slab panels were tested for two-point load and it was found that the BRC slabs reinforced with larger spacing of knots in bamboo possess higher flexural strength as well as higher ductility ratio than those samples of BRC slabs cast with bamboo having closely spaced knots. The probability of survival of BRC slab panels is determined by reliability analysis. In addition, the BRC slab panels considered for study are 47.54% energy efficient and 23.81% economical than the conventional Reinforced Concrete (RC) slabs of equivalent size. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."

Due to containment of swelling minerals in considerable proportion with net electronegative arrangement of ions, these clays possess extraordinary ability to absorb water resulting in low-strength and high-swelling structure of soil. These soils produce some of the major ill effects in the structural elements constructed over them due to their high activity and volume change behaviour, seriously hurting the utility of the structure. Chemical stabilizers have proved to be satisfactory modifier of the inherent structure of the soil. Although the conventional stabilizers such as lime, cement and fly ash have shown their ability to successfully enhance the utility of the soils for engineering purposes, their rising cost and environmental concerns including their carbon footprint have led researchers to focus on the more sustainable and environment-friendly form of stabilizers which could replace the former ones. This paper presents a summarization of the research works carried out in the recent past to counter the unwanted behaviour of expansive clays with the use of non-conventional waste products as potential stabilizers. In addition, the stabilization mechanism, field application, durability and possible environmental impact have also been addressed to present an overall picture of their future potential in stabilization of expansive soils. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Indian Geotechnical Society 2024."

The literature assessing the environmental impacts of household consumption is mostly focused on developed economies, thus, leaving a critical gap when it comes to assessing the impacts of household consumption and of related environmental policies in developing countries. Therefore, in order to fill this gap, this study analyzes household consumption-based emissions for high income, upper middle income, lower middle income, and low-income countries from six different geographical regions. It assesses the sector-wise CO2, CH4 and N2O-footprints and evaluates their social costs. The study methodology employs an environmentally extended multiregional input–output model from the EORA26 database which uses a common 26-sector classification for all countries. The findings show that household consumption accounts for 48–85% of the national CO2-footprints. (The values are similar for CH4 and N2O.) Developing economies have lower CO2-footprints of household final consumption than developed economies, but exert a higher pressure on the environment with respect to CH4- and N2O-footprints per capita. That highlights the necessity to focus environmental policies in developing countries on tackling CH4 and N2O on a first-priority basis. The study also identifies those sectors where the social costs of aggregated CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions make up a substantial share of the industries’ output, thus, indicating the level of technological efficiency of the respective economies and the industries where more stringent environmental regulation should be implemented. © The Author(s) 2023."

This proclivity underscores the urgent need for transitioning towards renewable energy sources to alleviate environmental footprints and economic vulnerabilities. A significant share of conventionally generated power is being consumed by the telecommunication sector of Saudi Arabia. Keeping in view the increasing costs, there is an extensive need for effective power utilization by these towers. Utilization of environment-friendly renewable energy resources for powering these towers can be a sustainable solution. However, important parameter considerations are to be kept in mind for technical, economic and environmental viability. This research work presented a techno-economic analysis of a standalone hybrid energy system to compensate the load demand of telecom towers in Saudi Arabia. The proposed system's performance has been assessed under various economic and environmental parameters to validate its efficiency, reliability, cost-effectiveness, and carbon footprints. The simulation results revealed that the proposed system is highly economical with levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) 0.18$/kWh in comparison to the conventional power system currently in-use with LCOE 0.46$/kWh. Furthermore, reduction of 37,326 kg/year in result of adoption of proposed configuration can lead to more environment friendly scenario. Based on the results, this study can be considered a benchmark to deploy this system to power telecom towers effectively in remote regions worldwide, especially in the middle eastern region. © 2024 The Authors"

This system features a self-powered water splitter with a solar harvester from an aluminium-doped zinc oxide/n-type silicon Schottky junction. Thin-film photovoltaic devices are connected in series to reach the reaction potential necessary for the electrolysis of water. Three types of device systems are studied, and their respective hydrogen generation properties are evaluated. The surface passivation effect from only 0.8 nm ultrathin aluminium oxide was found to effectively protect the device surface by withstanding the corrosion of critical solutions for hydrogen generation. In addition, the surface silicon nanopillars create numerical Schottky junctions that can reduce the reaction potential for the electrolysis of DI water from 1.28 V to 0.74 V and achieve a 115 μLh−1cm−2 hydrogen generation rate. Here, a bias-free and simple structural device system is successfully developed and is advantageous for directly converting solar energy into hydrogen among various water systems. The idea of a sustainable solar-powered hydrogen generation system as well as a future low-carbon footprint design meets the principles of the Paris Agreement. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC"

The research presents two new contributions. On the one hand, the basis of analysis on what we call ‘Excess per capita CF’, that is, the part of CF that exceeds a threshold associated with a minimum per capita consumption of each product in a household, below which level it is difficult to expect reductions in consumption. Second, the use of a quantile regression (QR) approach for the estimation of the drivers of CF. Both issues imply important changes in the consideration of the influence of some drivers considered so far in the literature, related to which CF quantile the household is in. These differences between an ordinary least squares (OLS) and the QR are especially significant for variables such as income, household size, occupation, age, household composition, housing area and area of residence. © The Author(s) 2022."

The determinants of energy consumption increase as the energy density of food production and storage increases. Reducing the amount of energy used for drying, freezing, chilling, refrigeration, and air conditioning is becoming more important. The objective of this study was to extend food’s shelf life utilizing creative and novel technical approaches, such as vacuum freeze-drying’s energy-efficient process. Despite being a part of this investigation, the vacuum freeze drier was created using environmentally benign energy sources. To minimize the carbon footprint of food preservation, it is essential to use eco-friendly energy sources in chilling storage. According to the first law of thermodynamics, the energy efficiency at 1 atm pressure and 25 [°C] temperature (neglecting potential and kinetic energies) in the dead state is calculated under thermal equilibrium conditions. In this study, the energy efficiency was shown according to 5 different scenarios. The results of energy efficiencies are as follows: η1 is from 14.3 to 21.4%, η2 is from 20.7 to 31.0%, η3 is from 27.3 to 40.9%, η4 is from 32.1 to 48.1%, and η5 is from 34.6 to 51.9%, respectively. This analysis demonstrates that the energy efficiency improved from 12 to 18 h. In this study, optimizations with scenarios were employed considering vacuum freeze-drying technology in the plant with sustainable energy sources can considerably improve food shelf life while limiting our environmental impact. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2023."

It focuses on implementing energy-efficient technologies and practices to minimize energy consumption and environmental impact. The study encompasses four cases, each addressing different aspects of energy use in a university setting, including the installation of LED lighting, programmable remote switches, and high-efficiency air conditioning systems. The methodology involves a detailed analysis of energy consumption patterns, using smart energy meters and theoretical calculations. Case I establishes a baseline energy consumption, while subsequent cases implement energy-saving measures. Case II involves replacing traditional tube lights with energy-efficient LED lights, resulting in considerable energy savings. Case III extends these savings further by integrating programmable remote switches mapped with student timetables. Finally, Case IV proposes the replacement of older air conditioning units with 25 SEER models, leading to significant reductions in energy use. The results highlight the effectiveness of these interventions. Case II achieves a 66.67% energy saving, while Case III yields up to 77.78% energy saving in lighting and 33.34% in air conditioning. In Case IV, the adoption of high-efficiency air conditioners can result in a 52% energy saving during teaching weeks. The economic benefits of these measures are substantial, with cost savings per classroom ranging from 7.65% in Case II to 53.46% in Case IV. Moreover, the environmental impact of these energy conservation techniques is substantial. The study reports reductions in carbon emissions from 14.71 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MT CO2e) in base Case I to 6.85 MT CO2e in Case IV. The overall carbon emission reductions for Cases II, III, and IV are 7.61%, 36.37%, and 53.43%, respectively.

It compares the environmental impact of this solution with hydrogen production from natural gas-steam reforming (NGSMR) and commercial electrolysis in the Portuguese context. Various metrics, including carbon footprint, water depletion, energy utilization, and waste valorization are employed for a comprehensive comparison. The assessment explores the impact of operational parameters and different off-gas combustion scenarios, incorporating water recycling practices. Due to challenges in obtaining detailed data on the actual reforming process, the study relies on process simulation techniques, primarily using DWSIM. Commercially available data for water electrolysers were used for comparison. In the context of decarbonizing power systems, hydrogen from water electrolysis emerges as a competitive option only in a scenario where the power system is 100% reliant on renewable sources, particularly with respect to the carbon footprint metric. Biogas systems, characterized by near-zero carbon emissions, stand out as a favourable option from the near future to the long run. This research contributes valuable insights into the dynamics of hydrogen production, shedding light on environmentally viable alternatives across a range of power system scenarios. © 2024 The Authors"

However, meeting current demands for material availability and environmental sustainability requires alternative methods limiting conventional chemical and energy-consuming chitin extraction from crustaceans. To assist future chitinous bioproduct development, this work analyzes the physicochemical properties and potential environmental sustainability of fungal chitin-glucan complexes. A conventional isolation procedure using sodium hydroxide, a weak acid, and short reaction times are applied to the fruiting body of 22 fungal species. Besides, the valorization of underutilized waste streams including Agaricus bisporus and Agaricus brunnescens stipes is investigated. The carbohydrate analysis renders chitin fractions in the range of 9.5-63.5 wt %, while yields vary from 4.2 to 29.9%, and the N-acetylation degree in found in between 53.0 and 98.7%. The sustainability of the process is analyzed using life cycle assessment (LCA), providing impact quantification for global warming potential, terrestrial acidification, freshwater eutrophication, and water use. With 87.5-589.3 kg·CO2-equiv per kilo, potentially lower global warming potential values in comparison to crustacean chitin are achieved. The crystallinity degree ranged from 28 to 78%, while the apparent chitin crystalline size (L020) is between 2.3 and 5.4 nm. Ten of the species yield α-chitin coexisting with semicrystalline glucans. Zwitterionic properties are observed in aqueous solutions, shifting from cationic to anionic at pH 4.5. With its renewable carbon content, fungal chitin is an environmentally sustainable alternative for high-value applications due to its balance of minimal treatment, low carbon footprint, material renewability, ease of isolation, thermal stability, zwitterionic behavior, biodegradability, and noncytotoxicity. © 2024 The Authors.

A literature review was conducted to identify the decision-making situations and limitations that MFCA and LCA (CFP) integration models can support. Twenty-one previous literatures were collected and three types of MFCA and LCA (CFP) integration methods were identified: collaborative, product-based partial integration, and process-based partial integration. Next, the collected prior literature was analyzed based on the CMA decision-making framework proposed and some issues were identified. The common challenge of the three existing integrated models is that they can only provide short-term and past-oriented information. It is difficult to provide incentives for carbon reduction because it does not show the relationship between the physical information of carbon emissions and the cost information. It is also difficult to encourage management to make long-term decisions on green procurement, capital investment, environmentally conscious product design, etc. Another common issue is that the use of MFCA tends to focus on the carbon emissions of material losses rather than all the carbon emissions carried by materials, which may impede product development and capital investment with zero or low carbon emissions in mind. This may inhibit product development and capital investment in consideration of zero carbon and low carbon emissions. The quality of LCA (CFP) information to support internal corporate decision-making is still lower than that of MFCA. Finally, another issue is how to share the information from MFCA among supply chains to extend the process-based partially integrated model to the supply chain. Copyright: ©2024 The authors.

Decarbonizing the operations of automotive Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) requires a holistic and systemic understanding of all environmentally relevant resource flows and the implementation of technologically and economically affordable solutions to achieve their targets for reducing the carbon footprint (CF). The CF analysis of Jaguar Land Rover Slovakia s.r.o. (JLR SK) was performed using the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol). The purpose of the study was to improve the understanding of CF within the context of an OEM. The authors of this study are not aware, as of the date of publication, of any other comparable outputs from CF analyses by GHG Protocol in Slovakia, making this study the first of its kind. The results showed that the total CF was 1,143,205 tCO2e (tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent); of which SCOPE 1 emissions were 18,584 tCO2e (1.62%), SCOPE 2 emissions were 0.87 tCO2e (0.0001%) and SCOPE 3 emissions were 1,130,866 tCO2e (98.38%). Normalized CF values for all three SCOPES were 309.81 tCO2e per active employee; 3.08 kgCO2e per unit of turnover (EUR); and 14.95 tCO2e per vehicle produced. Current legislative standards and the active participation of OEMs can lead the automotive industry towards sustainability, including the achievement of net-zero carbon emissions despite rising consumption or production volume.

141,"Unlocking the path to environmental sustainability: navigating economic policy uncertainty, ICT, and environmental taxes for a sustainable future",Article,Deng X.; Qamruzzaman M.; Karim S.,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,31.0,2024,37136,37162,10.1007/s11356-024-33566-6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193345742&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-024-33566-6&partnerID=40&md5=ed14eec0a2ea6e67b6fede8afd79756b,09441344,Scopus,Carbon emission; CUP-FM; CUP-BC; Nonlinear ARDL; Ecological footprint; Economic policy uncertainty; Environmental tax; Information communication and technology,"The study aims to gauge the impact of economic policy uncertainty, ICT, and environmental tax on environmental sustainability, which is measured by carbon emission and ecological footprint in a panel of 22 nations from 1997 to 2021. The present study has implemented the advanced panel data estimation techniques, including continuously updated fully modified (CUP-FM) and continuously updated bias-corrected (CUP-BC), dynamic seemingly unrelated regressions (DSUR), and nonlinear autoregressive distributed lagged (NARDL) in documenting the elasticities of target variables. Moreover, the directional causality has been tested through the D-H causality test. Study findings documented a positive and statistically significant linkage between EPU and environmental degradation. That is, EPU amplifies the emission of CO2 and ecological instability. The effects of ET and ICT are positively associated with environmental sustainability; that is, ET and ICT control the emission of CO2 and bring ecological improvement. This study contributes to the existing body of literature by conducting a thorough analysis of the relationship between various factors and their impact on environmental degradation. The study emphasizes the significance of every factor in influencing environmental outcomes. It provides policy suggestions to reduce CO2 emissions and promote ecological sustainability. The findings add valuable insights to the ongoing conversation about how to tackle environmental challenges in our constantly evolving world. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024."

Stakeholders are putting pressure on firms to disclose more details about their ecological footprints and greenhouse gas emissions. Finding authors, publications, journals, and discoveries in the literature on emission carbon disclosure is the aim of this endeavor. To do this, we employ a review methodology that makes use of the bibliometric study technique to pinpoint a few pertinent elements found in the literature. Utilizing tools such as VOSviewer and biblioshiny from RStudio, we examine output by year, authors, articles, and publications that have received more citations. We outline the key developments in the field of carbon disclosure together with the most widely applied ideas. Furthermore, we formulate the notion of carbon disclosure as suggested by Borghei (2021), concentrating on six domains and primary patterns within the field: Provide answers to the following questions: strategic climate, carbon disclosure determinants, carbon disclosure guarantee, quality of carbon disclosure, and carbon disclosure consequences. The incorporation of sustainability dimensions into the reporting system has replaced the evaluation techniques of the disclosures as the research issue. It is discovered that a number of factors influence the corporation’s choice to release its environmental accounting information. Based on its findings and analysis of current research trends and themes, this study offers suggestions for further investigation. © 2024, Econjournals. All rights reserved."
143,Immiscible foam displacement in low-permeability formations: A numerical study for screening potential reservoirs,Article,Sherratt J.; Sharifi Haddad A.; Rafati R.,Chemical Engineering Research and Design,205.0,2024,467,485,10.1016/j.cherd.2024.04.008,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190808650&doi=10.1016%2fj.cherd.2024.04.008&partnerID=40&md5=4a0220dcb12f4ad5f27c008403ad3ef6,02638762,Scopus,Foam; Immiscible displacement; Low-permeability formation; Oil recovery,"Understanding immiscible displacement in low-permeability porous media such as tight oil reservoirs, requires further studies. In this work, we explore the governing mechanisms during immiscible displacement of oil phase by an aqueous foam in low-permeability formations. An implicit pressure explicit composition numerical model coupled with a local equilibrium foam model (IMPEC-LE) is developed to study the performance of both immiscible CO2 and CO2-foam injection into low-permeability oil formations. Results show that at very low permeability the injectivity of an aqueous surfactant is very poor and therefore the displacement efficiency with foam is low. We found this permeability limit is approximately 0.1 mD and permeabilities below this can be quickly screened as unfavourable to foam injection. For permeabilities greater than 0.1 mD, foam injection always yields higher oil displacement efficiency than immiscible gas injection. It was shown that lower foam quality, has the tendency to increase the displacement efficiency by ensuring foam stability in the formation resulting in later gas breakthrough. The outcome of this study can be used to screen the applicability of foam in a foam-assisted displacement process to maximise the displacement efficiency and reduce the cost and environmental footprints associated with oil recovery processes. © 2024 The Authors"

The ophthalmic sector contributes to the emission of greenhouse gases, thus altering the natural environment. There is currently no data on global emissions of fluorinated gases in ophthalmic surgery. This retrospective study from 2017 to 2021 aims to report the carbon dioxide (CO 2) equivalence of sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6), hexafluoroethane (C 2 F 6), and octafluoropropane (C 3 F 8) at a tertiary eye center. Methods: Data collected from 1842 surgical procedures that used injections of fluorinated gases were analyzed. Environmental impact (global warming potential over 100 years) was calculated by converting milliliters to grams by using modified ideal gas law at standard temperature and pressure for the canisters and then to their CO 2 equivalence. Results: Though 70% of surgeries used C 3 F 8, the least greenhouse effect causing fluorinated gas, the total carbon emission was 1.4 metric tons. The most common indication was macular hole surgery (36.86%). Conclusion: This study paves a step toward analyzing the problem statement, thus awakening us to contemplate options to make ophthalmic surgeries greener.  © 2023 Copyright: "

Collecting operational parameters related to various facility systems and process equipment is initially performed by using the developed energy conversion factors (ECF) calculator. Moreover, innovative fab energy simulation (FES) software has been designed by Taipei Tech. This software is designed for high-tech fab energy consumption analysis. The annual energy consumption data for fabs can be calculated. This data is then converted into carbon dioxide emissions using the power carbon emission coefficient provided by the Bureau of Energy, Ministry of Economic Affairs Taiwan. In this study, five different energy-saving strategies were proposed. The energy consumption and carbon emissions distribution were evaluated to assess the benefits of those different techniques. The findings show that among the existing operational facilities, the use of an exhaust air conditioning unit with reduced enthalpy value setting, with lowered supply air temperature, demonstrates the highest energy-saving. This technique has the potential to annually reduce carbon emissions by approximately 623,158 kg CO2 and operational costs by NT$ 6,005,764 (189,602 U.S.$ ). This can reduce the overall manufacturing cost and is also beneficial for the environment.  © 1988-2012 IEEE."

Moreover, its properties can be further enhanced via surface functionalization with metallic nanoparticles (NPs) such as silver, zinc, etc. However, the synthesis of metallic NPs is challenging, costly, and environmentally harmful. On the other hand, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are highly suitable as an additive to cellulose paper due to their high electrical conductivity, excellent mechanical strength, ease of fabrication, and antibacterial properties. In this study, we coated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) on Hanji, a traditional Korean paper, using a simple dipping method and investigated its antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (E. coli). The MWCNT-coated Hanji exhibited an inhibition efficiency of ~ 93% against E. coli cells. Moreover, the MWCNT coating resulted in improved mechanical strength, enhanced electrical conductivity, and increased hydrophobicity of the Hanji. Furthermore, it was observed that MWCNTs exhibited exceptionally stable adhesion to the Hanji surface. Our finding shows that MWCNT-coated Hanji could be utilized as an antibacterial material that is used as masks, air pollution filters, and wallpapers in hospitals and residential complexes, and an efficient platform for antiviral studies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024."

Carbon footprint, one of the measurement methods, is a widely applied tool to assess the environmental impact of organizations. This study presents a real case study of a denim-washing company’s activities based on ISO standard calculation methods of greenhouse gas emissions. Accordingly, the annual carbon footprint of the denim-washing company was 2482.09 tCO2e for the year 2021 in total for the overall carbon footprint. Direct emission was calculated at 1575.75 tCO2e, indirect energy–related emission at 798.09 tCO2e, and indirect non-energy–related emission at 108.25 tCO2e. The highest CO2 emissions are related to heating from greenhouse gas direct emission sources, followed by purchased electricity consumption, and the lowest CO2 emissions are related to fire–CO2 tube storage. In conclusion, this study is particular in that it analyzes not only the specific processes of a denim-washing company but also the overall organizational carbon footprint calculation, assesses the importance of indirect non-energy in the total carbon footprint, and evaluates the calculation findings with sector-specific mitigation strategies. © The Author(s) 2024."

However, the high hydrophilicity of nanocellulose is not conducive to its adsorption at the oil–water interface, resulting in a low emulsification capacity of Pickering emulsion. This work applied 2,2,6,6-tetramethy1-1-piperidyloxy(TEMPO)-mediated oxidation and sodium periodate oxidation to prepare nanocellulose with carboxyl and aldehyde groups, and studied the effects of bonding forms on the hydrophilicity of bovine serum albumin (BSA)/nanocellulose composites. Compared with pure components, the composite products prepared by adsorbing or grafting had improved effects in the emulsification by increasing viscosity and reducing surface wettability. With adsorbed BSA, the composite showed a higher hydrophobicity, and the corresponding Pickering emulsion had an extended oil fraction of 60%. Due to the strong chemical bonding, the grafted composite can stabilize the Pickering emulsion of a 70% oil fraction with stable droplets of uniform size. This study provides an idea for improving the emulsification performance of nanocellulose through protein bonding.

The youth origin of YAR stars has been proposed to be binary evolution via mass transfer or stellar mergers. If that is the case, YAR stars should spin rapidly and thus be magnetically active, because they are mass and angular momentum gainers. In this study, to seek this binary footprint, we select YAR stars on the main-sequence turn-off or the subgiant branch (MSTO-SGB) from APOGEE DR17, whose ages and projected rotation velocities (vsin i) can be precisely measured. With APOGEE vsin i and LAMOST spectra, we find that YAR stars are indeed fast rotators and magnetically active. In addition, we observe low [C/N] ratios and high Gaia RUWE in some YAR stars, suggesting that these MSTO-SGB stars probably have experienced mass transfer from red-giant companions. Our findings underscore that magnetic activity can serve as a valuable tool for probing the binary evolution for other chemically peculiar stars, such as red giants with lithium anomalies and carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars. © The Author(s) 2024.

Promoting responsible tourism and using sustainable tourism practises, like offering eco-friendly lodging, is a key part of protecting natural habitats and lowering carbon footprints. Hence, this study tries to examine the relationship between tourism development, economic policy uncertainty, renewable energy, and natural resources on the ecological footprint of India during 1990–2022. This study applies a novel dynamic ARDL simulation approach for long-run and short-run analyses. The study also employs frequency-domain causality to check the causal relationship between the variables. The result reveals that tourism has a positive effect on the ecological footprint. Similarly, economic policy uncertainty has a positive and significant effect on the ecological footprint in India during the sample period. Additionally, natural resource rent shows a positive effect on the ecological footprint or deteriorating environmental quality in the short and long run in the sample period. However, renewable energy consumption indicates a negative effect on the ecological footprint. The results reveal that TDI and EPU have rejected the null hypothesis of no Granger cause in the long, medium, and short term. While renewable energy has a causal relationship with ecological footprints in both the long run and medium run, it is imperative for India to adopt measures that facilitate the advancement of sustainable tourism, with a particular focus on promoting environmentally friendly lodging options, enhancing public transportation systems, and implementing effective waste management strategies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024."

Derived primarily from the transesterification of vegetable oils or animal fats, biodiesel offers an eco-friendly energy avenue with a minimized carbon footprint. Catalysts are central to the success of this process, which significantly enhance yield rates. Geopolymers, traditionally associated with construction applications due to their inorganic nature, have been derived from aluminosilicate sources activated using alkaline solutions. However, recent advancements spotlight geopolymers in a new light, emphasizing their prospective role as nanocatalytic agents for biodiesel synthesis. This paradigm shift suggests improved production efficiency and an innovative method of repurposing industrial waste. This study centers on the pioneering application of geopolymers, fortified with magnetite, as potent heterogeneous catalysts for biodiesel generation from soybean and safflower oils. By leveraging a meticulously crafted geopolymer matrix—consisting of metakaolin, sodium hydroxide, and magnetite—this research replaced traditional catalysts with this advanced nanostructured geopolymer variant in the biodiesel methylation process. The research delved deep to ascertain the prime synthesis conditions. Furthermore, utilizing cutting-edge machine learning methodologies provided an analytical lens to navigate the extensive experimental data, thereby fine-tuning the optimization trajectory. One of the salient takeaways from this research is the validation that geopolymer catalysts, rooted in kaolinite, can be ingeniously tailored to ensure elevated biodiesel yields across a spectrum of oil sources, underscoring their unparalleled efficiency and versatility in the biofuel domain. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."

Numerous control approaches for PV maximum power point tracking (MPPT) have lately been investigated. This paper proposes a metaheuristic algorithm to reach PV maximum power more efficiently based on the hybridization of Improved Grey Wolf Optimization (IGWO) and BAT algorithms, which are chosen for their reliability and fast MPPT for PV systems. However, they both encounter issues including delayed convergence and increased oscillations while tracking. To overcome these limitations, a newly Improved Grey Wolf BAT Optimization (IGWBO) is applied to specify the duty cycle parameter that is used in MPPT to enhance the performance of FPV systems under a variety of non-uniform weather scenarios. The results of implementing IGWBO-FPV are compared to those of IGWO-FPV, GWO-FPV, BAT-FPV, and FPV without any control algorithm. The findings revealed that the proposed IGWBO-FPV approach outperforms the annual generated power of the IGWO-FPV, GWO-FPV, BAT-FPV, and FPV without control by 5.64%, 10.58%, 17.54%, and 27.28% respectively. The optimal IGWBO-FPV enviro-economic evaluation indicates that 42.83 tons of CO2/year can be prevented from being released into the environment, with an LCOE of 0.052 $/kWh. © 2024 The Institution of Chemical Engineers"

In this study we explore the opportunity to replace the expanded polystyrene packaging, with a corrugated cardboard coated with bioplastic for the storage and transport of cheese and mozzarella. Life cycle analysis (LCA) indicates that the use of bioplastic coated corrugated board could significantly reduce the packaging's carbon footprint. Corrugated board has a lower environmental impact than polystyrene, except for the ecosystem quality indicator. This indicator is worse for corrugated because of the impacts associated with the cultivation of corn and sugar cane needed for bioplastics production, as well as the deforestation associated with paper production. EPS, on the other hand, is more impactful due to oil extraction and disposal processes such as landfill and incineration. From the analysis of defined sensitivity by increasing the percentage of composting and recycling, there is an improvement in the environmental performance of coated board, even in critical categories. Therefore, the latter scenario is the ideal and desired solution to obtain the replacement of EPS packaging with bioplastic coated cardboard. © 2024 The Author(s)"

However, as they are intermittent and fluctuating, renewable energies alone cannot provide a 24/7 supply and should be combined with a secondary source. Finding the optimal infrastructure configuration for both renewable production and financial costs remains difficult. In this article, we examine three scenarios with on-site renewable energy sources combined respectively with the electrical grid, batteries alone and batteries with hydrogen storage systems. The objectives are first, to size optimally the electric infrastructure using combinations of standard microgrids approaches, second to quantify the level of grid utilization when data centers consume/ export electricity from/to the grid, to determine the level of effort required from the grid operator, and finally to analyze the cost of 100% autonomy provided by the battery-based configurations and to discuss their economical viability. Our results show that in the grid-dependent mode, 63.1% of the generated electricity has to be injected into the grid and retrieved later. In the autonomous configurations, the cheapest one including hydrogen storage leads to a unit cost significantly more expensive than the electricity supplied from a national power system in many countries.  © 2016 IEEE."

Existing methods mainly promote ridesharing by flocking multiple orders to the minimum required vehicles. However, supply-demand variations may aggregate undersupply in the long run and affect the order completion rate. Meanwhile, it is difficult to accurately estimate associating utility among ridesharing orders with lane-level features, such as traffic flow. To fill this gap, we propose ERShare, an elastic order dispatching algorithm to maximize the order completion rate in the MoD system. First, the ridesharing order dispatching problem is formulated as an offline optimization problem, and then it is proved that the order completion rate is maximized when the MoD system achieves long-term supply-demand equilibrium. Next, a dummy order/vehicle generation method is proposed to generate dummies as a spinner to achieve supply-demand equilibrium elastically. Also, a lane-level ridesharing rule is designed to accurately estimate the associating utility based on an order association graph. Subsequently, a dummy-based order dispatching algorithm is proposed to find the optimal dispatching decisions. Finally, the simulations on real-world data validate the superiority of ERShare over state-of-the-art solutions regarding order completion rate. © 2023 IEEE."

We employ a fully modified ordinary least squares framework for cointegrating polynomial regressions, and include obtained long-run relations in a panel Vector Error Correction model. The findings suggest that the linear EKC form is more coherent for Central Asia compared to the N-shaped EKC form. We link this to the fact that the Central Asian countries are in the first stage of the EKC. We observe that Gross domestic product, ecological footprint, energy consumption and climate change adaptation positively impact carbon dioxide emissions in the long-run. Moreover, there is bidirectional causality from GDP and climate change adaptation to CO2 emissions, while causality is unidirectional between emissions and energy consumption. © The Author(s) 2023."

But the variability of results has also been questioned by several published LCA reviews, the latest identified dating back from 2016. This article aims at assessing whether new developments and knowledge confirm this statement. Methods: Meta-analysis is a systematic review approach that allows to assess this variability. It was applied in this study to measure and understand the dynamics behind the greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions of nuclear electricity in a life cycle perspective. From 114 publications identified since 2012, 22 primary studies were selected and analysed to provide a meta-database of 63 estimations of greenhouse gases (GHG) per kWh generated. A descriptive analysis of the meta-database provided a status of the art on the topic in terms of approaches adopted, data sources, etc. Additional data exploitation using boxplot graphs was performed to assess the dispersion and variability of the results around these figures depending on several factors such as extraction mining technique and energy demand, enrichment technology used, reactor’s size, and type of LCA practitioners. Results and discussion: The life cycle GHG emissions of nuclear electricity found with the meta-analysis were 3.09 g CO2 eq./kWh (min), 6.36 g CO2 eq./kWh (median), 12.4 g CO2 eq./kWh (average excluding extrema), and 43.2 g CO2 eq./kWh (max), although extremum values were also identified at 53.4, 60.0, and one outlier, based on theoretical scenarios. Using principal component analysis (PCA), the two most influential variables of the environmental performance of nuclear electricity were identified: GHG emissions intensity of the electricity consumed during the enrichment of uranium and energy demand for the extraction of uranium ore. Conclusions: Finally, the contributions of this meta-analysis to current knowledge on the GHG emissions intensity of nuclear electricity generation systems were discussed, including life cycle step breakdown, data gaps, limits, and uncertainties associated to the back end and reactor activities. Among the main areas for improvement for future LCA studies, the study helped identify a need for consolidated industrial data along with harmonised practices regarding system boundary definition. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024."

High-temperature superconductor (HTS) cables offer a high-capacity and small-footprint solution compared to traditional cable technologies, making them ideal for densely populated areas. HTS cables, however, possess different electrical characteristics compared to conventional cables. This paper presents a specific case study of a 12.9 km long 275 kV HTS cable connecting Birkenhead Substation and Lister Drive Substation in the U.K. A dynamic electrical model incorporating the varying resistance of the HTS cable was constructed. The HTS cable model was integrated into an equivalent test network, representing conditions at the target site, to analyse its behaviour and impact on conventional power system protection performance via simulation case studies. The results indicate that differential protection operates reliably, while distance protection is impacted by the varying resistance. However, the proposed HTS cable design at the specified location presents a relatively small change in HTS cable resistance. The impact on distance protection was therefore minimal and can be addressed by considering HTS properties when determining distance protection settings. The study was conducted by considering manufacturer-supplied HTS parameters, network parameters reflective of an actual location in the U.K. grid, and protection requirements specified in the U.K. grid code. The study provides valuable insights into practicality and protection strategies for reliable HTS cable operation in a real-world transmission network. The findings can inform future HTS cable designs and installations globally, as well as provide a framework for further research in this area.  © 2002-2011 IEEE."

This paper explores the microstructure and certain properties of SSC, focusing on the particular complexities of its microstructure and the difficulties of microanalysis of its hydrates. To do so, SSC paste samples were first cast to identify hydration products using X-ray diffraction, then observed at early age using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and at early and late age using scanning electron microscopy. In addition, concrete cores impregnated with fluorescein in order to highlight porosity, cracking and aggregates debonding were observed under UV light using optical microscopy (OM), showing a complete absence of cracking and aggregate debonding. Both microscopy techniques (CLSM and UV light OM) have been applied to this type of binder for the first time. The results show that SSC microstructure is characterised by a sophisticated intergrowth of various phases, including ettringite and amorphous calcium-(alumina)-silicate hydrate gels.

Narrow-band imaging (NBI) enables endoscopic grading of GIM (EGGIM). In the era of climate change, gastrointestinal endoscopists are expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and medical waste. Based on the diagnostic performance of NBI endoscopy, this study measured the environmental impact and reduced cost of implementing EGGIM during gastroscopy. Methods: Using NBI endoscopy in 242 patients, EGGIM classification and operative link on GIM (OLGIM) staging were prospectively performed in five different areas (lesser and greater curvatures of the corpus and antrum, and the incisura angularis). We estimated the environmental impact and cost reduction of the biopsy procedures and pathological processing if EGGIM were used instead of OLGIM. Results: The diagnostic accuracy of NBI endoscopy for GIM was 93.0–97.1% depending on the gastric area. When a high EGGIM score ≥ 5 was the cut-off value for predicting OLGIM stages III–IV, the area under the curve was 0.862, sensitivity was 81.9%, and specificity was 90.4%. The reduction in the carbon footprint by EGGIM was −0.4059 kg carbon dioxide equivalents per patient, equivalent to 1 mile driven by a gasoline-powered car. The cost savings were calculated to be $47.36 per patient. Conclusions: EGGIM is a reliable method for identifying high-risk gastric cancer patients, thereby reducing the carbon footprint and medical costs in endoscopy practice. © 2024 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd."

Based on the availability of data, the research object is positioned as the sample data of 152 countries from 2002 to 2018 to obtain more in-depth and comprehensive research conclusions. The empirical results show that: (1) Corruption control has a significant effect on improving the ecological environment in countries and regions with poor environmental quality. The impact of natural resource rent on environmental quality remains inconclusive, when environmental quality is relatively high, natural resource rent tends to promote the increase of carbon emissions, but there is a reduction effect on the ecological footprint. For countries and regions with better environmental quality, there will be an effect of increasing resource consumption and reducing pollutant emissions. (2) Increasing the consumption intensity of energy will lead to the deterioration of environmental quality, and increasing the proportion of renewable resources will increase and weaken this impact, so it is particularly important to improve the energy consumption structure and improve environmental quality. (3) The impact of urbanization on environmental quality dose not form a unified opinion, and the difference in the selection of environmental quality indicators brings variability to the results, which also prompts the adoption of multiple indicators or the establishment of a composite index that covers multiple perspectives of environmental quality to conduct comprehensive and in-depth research on environmental quality. © 2024 United Nations."

However, estimating carbon footprints is a complex task, given the diversity of existing distribution channels. Average values for carbon emissions of “conventional” retail (i.e., purchasing and receiving the product directly at the physical point of sale) found in most studies mask a heterogeneous reality: different retail strategies entail diverse shopping behavior for consumers, as well as varied procurement processes for outlets. In this paper, we propose a methodology to assess greenhouse gas (GHG) impacts of different distribution systems related to the consumption of goods in the Paris Region by coupling traditional transport modeling with a life-cycle assessment (LCA) approach. We model and compare six distribution systems, including five traditional retail formats (hypermarkets, supermarkets, small generalist retail, small food retail, and small nonfood retail) and E-commerce home deliveries. Our model includes warehouse activity, shop and home delivery, shop energy consumption, consumer mobility, and goods packaging. Overall, we conclude that E-commerce emits fewer GHG emissions than retail outlets per kilogram of product purchased. This result is in line with the existing literature on the topic. However, the carbon footprint varies greatly within the case study depending on the characteristics of the logistics procurement processes of outlets, the behavior of shoppers, and spatial characteristics. © 2024 The Authors.

Following this trend, China is one of the top contributors to global pollution, and at the same time, it is a leading producer of electricity production from renewable sources (ELREC). The current research examines the relationship between ELREC, research and development (REDEV), and economic growth and their impact on three environmental quality indicators: carbon dioxide emissions, ecological footprint, and load capacity factor in China from 1985 to 2018. This research is significant because it helps to identify factors contributing to the environmental deterioration in China and how they can be addressed. Using the autoregressive distributed lag and dynamic autoregressive distributed lag model, the research suggests a load capacity curve (LCC) and simultaneously tests the LCC and environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypotheses. The findings indicate that the LCC and EKC hypotheses are viable in China and that ELREC favorably influences environmental quality.

172,An innovative heterogeneous transfer learning framework to enhance the scalability of deep reinforcement learning controllers in buildings with integrated energy systems,Article,Coraci D.; Brandi S.; Hong T.; Capozzoli A.,Building Simulation,17.0,2024,739,770,10.1007/s12273-024-1109-6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85185248247&doi=10.1007%2fs12273-024-1109-6&partnerID=40&md5=f15d6253344fbe85f9d1ab8a1605c275,19963599,Scopus,building control; building energy management; reinforcement learning; transfer learning,"Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based control shows enhanced performance in the management of integrated energy systems when compared with Rule-Based Controllers (RBCs), but it still lacks scalability and generalisation due to the necessity of using tailored models for the training process. Transfer Learning (TL) is a potential solution to address this limitation. However, existing TL applications in building control have been mostly tested among buildings with similar features, not addressing the need to scale up advanced control in real-world scenarios with diverse energy systems. This paper assesses the performance of an online heterogeneous TL strategy, comparing it with RBC and offline and online DRL controllers in a simulation setup using EnergyPlus and Python. The study tests the transfer in both transductive and inductive settings of a DRL policy designed to manage a chiller coupled with a Thermal Energy Storage (TES). The control policy is pre-trained on a source building and transferred to various target buildings characterised by an integrated energy system including photovoltaic and battery energy storage systems, different building envelope features, occupancy schedule and boundary conditions (e.g., weather and price signal). The TL approach incorporates model slicing, imitation learning and fine-tuning to handle diverse state spaces and reward functions between source and target buildings. Results show that the proposed methodology leads to a reduction of 10% in electricity cost and between 10% and 40% in the mean value of the daily average temperature violation rate compared to RBC and online DRL controllers. Moreover, online TL maximises self-sufficiency and self-consumption by 9% and 11% with respect to RBC. Conversely, online TL achieves worse performance compared to offline DRL in either transductive or inductive settings. However, offline Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents should be trained at least for 15 episodes to reach the same level of performance as the online TL. Therefore, the proposed online TL methodology is effective, completely model-free and it can be directly implemented in real buildings with satisfying performance. © The Author(s) 2024."

However, the choice of sewage sludge incineration process is still controversial. In this study, the comparative life cycle assessment of sewage sludge incineration processes, including the mono-incineration, co-incineration in coal-fired power plants and co-incineration in municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration plants, was carried out from the perspective of environment, carbon footprint and economy. The environmental assessment results show that terrestrial ecotoxicity, freshwater ecotoxicity, marine ecotoxicity, human carcinogenic toxicity and human non-carcinogenic toxicity are the most significant environmental impacts. And the environmental performance of co-incineration in coal-fired power plants is the best. Moreover, the environmental impact is most sensitive to the dehydrant, electricity and fly ash chelating agent. Co-incineration in MSW incineration plants has the lowest carbon emissions, with only 70.50% and 82% of the carbon emissions from mono-incineration and co-incineration in coal-fired power plants, respectively. Furthermore, sewage sludge mono-incineration has the highest disposal costs because of the higher depreciation and solid waste disposal costs. The comprehensive evaluation results reveal that the optimization should focus on the selection of dehydrant and fly ash chelating agent, as well as the improvement of the equipment efficiency. © The Author(s) 2023."

In this context, different philosophies exist. A classic debate, referred to as “boomsters vs. doomsters”, asks whether humanity's drive for technological innovations will mitigate climate change, or whether it is justifiable to compromise our living standards, affluence, and consumption patterns. A Danish research project has elucidated this topic through cross-collaboration between historians and engineers by quantifying the personal consumption-based carbon footprint (CF) of Danish citizens, taking into account the consumption segments of food, transport, housing, and furniture. Quantification is conducted through life-cycle assessments (LCA) of five decadal timesteps during the period 1860–2020. As only one other study conducting historical (retrospective) LCA with an extensive time horizon was identified in the scientific literature, our own study provides novel insights by exploring possible approaches in this field. Historical LCA has many similarities with prospective (future) LCA, providing inspiration to the approach. The main challenge of the study is to adjust both foreground and background systems in the inventory modelling phase. Data is largely based on national statistics, books, museum case studies, expert testimonials, and proxies such as using the steam turbine as an indicator of improvements to technological efficiency over time. The results show a slightly declining carbon footprint in the period 1860–1930, from 7.7 to 6.6 t CO2-eq per capita annually. Unsurprisingly the footprint peak is not found until the 1970s, at 11 t, reducing to 5.4 t in the 2010s. The residential energy consumption segment contributes half of this CF, followed by transportation by road and rail. Discussion of the results shows that whether technology can mitigate the impact from the increase in affluence depends on the specific consumption segment. For housing combined with residential energy, the results show that technology can mitigate increases in CF, despite the comforts of home having only increased over time. For the transportation segment, however, the past century has seen an eightfold increase in CF due to the pronounced evolution of personal modes of transportation. The findings suggests that the “boomsters vs. doomsters” debate is not so black and white after all. We further suggest that historical LCA, in tandem with prospective LCA, can provide valuable insights for decision support to facilitate a green transition and hence a green future. © 2024 The Authors"

Reliable data around military resource use and environmental damage is highly variable. Researchers are dependent upon military transparency, the context of military operations, and broader emissions reporting. While studies are beginning to emerge on global militaries and their carbon footprints, less work has focused on wartime emissions. We examine one sliver of the hidden carbon emissions of late-modern warfare by focusing on the use of concrete “blast walls” by US forces in Baghdad over a five-year period (2003–2008). This study uses a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to study one of the world's largest military carbon footprints of concrete, an infrastructural weapon in late-modern urban counterinsurgencies. Moving beyond dominant discourses on climate-security and “greening”, we present one of the first studies to expose direct and indirect military emissions resulting from combat. © 2023 The Authors.

This study is the first to construct a Difference in Carbon pressures-adjusted Human Development Index (DCHDI) model for the purpose of exploring the coupling effect between carbon emissions and human development variety from 2000 to 2019 in Chinese provinces. We demonstrate the following. (1) The total energy-related carbon footprint of 30 provinces in China reached 10.2 billion tons in 2019, with an average annual growth rate of 6.93% over the past two decades; and the provinces with the highest carbon emissions per capita are InnerMongolia, Ningxia, and Shanxi. (2) At the provincial level, we observed that the Human Development Index (HDI), which includes life expectancy, education, and income, has been rising, while Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin entered the super-high HDI level before 2008. (3) The entire coupling effect of 30 Chinese provinces has been broadly fortified in the last 20 years, but the growth rate of DCHDI values in 2011–2019 has slowed down compared with that in 2000–2010; the clustering phenomenon demonstrated that this discovery is associated with historical peaks in total carbon emissions. (4) The coordination degree of carbon emissions per capita and HDI was verified, and 96% of the data points were found in the range of super high coupling coordination degree. Overall, this study provides the government with worthwhile guidance for decision-making and carbon reduction strategies for other countries struggling to advance human sustainable development. © 2023"

This study aims to investigate the distribution, source characteristics, and ecological risks of PAHs in black-odorous urban river sediments, providing support for environmental safety assessment and pollution control. Material and methods: A total of 173 surface sediment samples were collected and analyzed for 17 types of PAHs using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The sources of PAHs were identified using isomer ratio indicator analysis and a positive matrix factorization model (PMF). Furthermore, the health risks of the PAHs were assessed using the Sediment Quality Guidelines and the organic carbon normalization method. Results: The total PAH concentration ranged from 0.02 to 52 μg g−1 dry weight. PMF and isomer ratio indicators revealed that the predominant sources were petroleum and fuel combustion. The ratio of perylene to pentacyclic aromatic isomers was < 10 in 75% of the samples. Most areas posed a low risk. Conclusions: PAH concentrations exceeded those typically found in lakes and river surface sediments, ordinary industrial parks, and agricultural soils. However, no distinct spatial distribution was evident. The primary contributors were fossil, coal, and biomass fuel combustion. Moreover, the source of perylene exhibited spatial variability—natural biodiagenesis in South China and anthropogenic pyrolysis in North China. These suggest that as an index to trace the sediment footprint of large river influences, its environmental significance varied with different locations. The ecological risk assessment indicated that PAHs in most polluted urban river sediments posed low to moderate risks. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024."

Renewable energy consumption could play a major role in mitigating the effects of climate change by improving environmental quality in the region. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of renewable energy consumption on environmental quality in sub-Saharan African countries. Design/methodology/approach: The empirical investigation is based on the estimation of an augmented Green Solow model through the defactored instrumental variables approach on a sample of 34 countries over the period 1996 to 2018. Findings: The results of two-stage defactored instrumental variables estimator show that renewable energy consumption improves environmental quality. Indeed, renewable energies have a significant negative influence on CO2 emissions. This result is robust when using the ecological footprint as an indicator of environmental quality. Practical implications: In terms of implications, governments in Sub-Saharan Africa need to pursue policies to encourage investment in the renewable energy sector. This will promote renewable energy consumption, change the structure of the energy mix in favour of renewable energy, improve environmental quality and effectively combat climate change. Originality/value: The originality of this research in relation to the existing literature lies at several levels. Firstly, the analysis is carried out using a unified framework combining the environmental Kuznets curve and the environmental convergence hypotheses. Secondly, this research uses a very recent econometric method. Finally, environmental quality is measured using two indicators. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."

The dynamic relationships between the THF, heat island intensity (HII), and quarterly average temperature (QAT) are investigated. The impulse response function and variance decomposition analysis are used to assess if a long-term causal relationship exists between the three indicators. The results show the following. (1) The hotel industry in Macao is the source of energy consumption and heat release. (2) A Granger causality relationship exists between the THF and QAT but not between the THF and HII. (3) The interaction effect between the growth rate of the THF and QAT is manifested as shocks with the same frequency and regular periodic fluctuations.

Research findings/insights: Utilizing a global sample of publicly listed companies for the period 2004–2019, we find that a one-standard deviation increase in demographic and structural diversity translates into 4.66% and 7.11% higher corporate eco-innovation, respectively. Furthermore, we discover that demographic and structural diversity promotes eco-innovation by offsetting the negative effects of political risk. In an additional analysis, we find evidence that, in the absence of greater external monitoring (institutional investors and analyst following), organizations benefit more from the monitoring role of board diversity. Theoretical/academic implications: By adopting the concept of “bundling the governance mechanisms,” our study adds to the ongoing discourse about the function of board diversity in addressing corporate climate footprints by offering original evidence that board diversity heterogeneity—demographic and structural diversity—matters for corporate eco-innovation. Practitioner/policy implications: Given the increasing pressure on companies to manage their environmental impacts and carbon footprints, our paper has significant ramifications for those involved in promoting eco-innovative business practices, such as policymakers, regulators, and practitioners. © 2023 The Authors.

Quantifying urban emissions and trends over time is needed to evaluate the efficacy of policy targeting emission reductions as well as to understand more fundamental questions about the urban biosphere. A number of approaches have been proposed to measure, report, and verify (MRV) changes in urban CO2 emissions. Here we show that a modest capital cost, spatially dense network of sensors, the Berkeley Environmental Air Quality and CO2 Network (BEACO2N), in combination with Bayesian inversions, result in a synthesis of measured CO2 concentrations and meteorology to yield an improved estimate of CO2 emissions and provide a cost-effective and accurate assessment of CO2 emissions trends over time. We describe nearly 5 years of continuous CO2 observations (2018-2022) in a midsized urban region (the San Francisco Bay Area). These observed concentrations constrain a Bayesian inversion that indicates the interannual trend in urban CO2 emissions in the region has been a modest decrease at a rate of 1.8 ± 0.3%/year. We interpret this decrease as primarily due to passenger vehicle electrification, reducing on-road emissions at a rate of 2.6 ± 0.7%/year. © 2024 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society."

Recently, multi-objective hyperparameter optimization has been proposed to search for Machine Learning models which offer equally Pareto-efficient trade-offs between accuracy and fairness. Although these approaches proved to be more versatile than fairness-aware Machine Learning algorithms—which instead optimize accuracy constrained to some threshold on fairness—their carbon footprint could be dramatic, due to the large amount of energy required in the case of large datasets. We propose an approach named FanG-HPO: fair and green hyperparameter optimization (HPO), based on both multi-objective and multiple information source Bayesian optimization. FanG-HPO uses subsets of the large dataset to obtain cheap approximations (aka information sources) of both accuracy and fairness, and multi-objective Bayesian optimization to efficiently identify Pareto-efficient (accurate and fair) Machine Learning models. Experiments consider four benchmark (fairness) datasets and four Machine Learning algorithms, and provide an assessment of FanG-HPO against both fairness-aware Machine Learning approaches and two state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization tools addressing multi-objective and energy-aware optimization. © The Author(s) 2024."

Carbon Footprint (CF) Calculators pose potential for helping individuals situate themselves in climate impacting systems of which they are a part. However, little is currently known about whether and how individuals who complete CF calculators understand their CF in the context of climate change. This article explores how people make sense of their CFs and locate themselves in the capitalocene. It draws on theories of social practices, environmental ethics, valuation, and knowledge-use to analyse data from 500+ Danes who completed a CF calculator (https://carbonfootprint.hi.is) and interviews with 30 Danes who were asked to complete the CF calculator. In this article, we describe how Danes’ CFs are impacted, looking at how survey respondents rate importance of mitigating climate change, importance of personal actions, and importance of public steering, as well as disposable income, living space, and family type. We also show how interviewees reflect over their consumption activities and possibilities. Those with high income nearly always had high CF but felt like they had little agency to change the system and rather justified their high-emitting practices such as flying, while those with low CF felt they had more agency in the system. The results show that high-CF individuals resist voluntary reduction of their emissions despite the presence of environmental ethics. Thus, we conclude that systemic solutions have the foremost capacity to reduce carbon emissions. © The Author(s) 2024. corrected publication 2024."

Consequently, this article aims to rank and evaluate the challenges to implement the G-IoT towards the SDA. An integrated approach is proposed with stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) and additive ratio assessment (ARAS) under Pythagorean fuzzy sets. As a result, an machine-to-machine (M2M) standardization protocol with a weight value of 0.0508 has the first rank, followed by adaptation to natural energy sources with a weight value of 0.0479, information security and privacy protection with a weight value of 0.0469, and internet protocol version-6 (IPv6) for low-end devices with weight 0.0467. To validate the proposed method, sensitivity analysis and comparison using existing methods have been conducted. © 2022 The Author(s)."

It is of great practical significance for China to find out the current situation and future trend of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from sugar production, and explore measures for reducing GHG emissions from sugar planting and processing. The IPCC GHG emissions accounting method is applied to analyze the carbon footprint of sugar production based on planting management and industrial development data, in which the GHG emissions per unit of sugar product are calculated and analyzed. According to Carbon Peak and Carbon Neutrality targets, the total GHG emissions of China's sugar industry in 2030 and 2060 are predicted and discussed. The results show that: (1) The average GHG emissions per unit yield of sugar show a downward trend from 2004 to 2021. The total GHG emissions of sugar production in China have reached 1319.9 × 104 t CO2eq in 2021, which has not yet reached its peak due to the growth of consumption demand. (2) The average GHG emissions per unit of Beet Sugar (1.477 tCO2eq/t) is higher than that of Cane Sugar (0.825 tCO2eq/t). It is more meaningful to enlarge the planting area of sugarcane than that of sugarbeet in the future. (3) Overall, in 2021 the GHG emissions of sugar production reached 0.91 tCO2eq/t in China, which would decline 15 %–87 % until 2030 and 2060. There is great potential for sugar production to reduce GHG emissions in the future. © 2024 Institution of Chemical Engineers"

This will bring extensive and profound changes to the manufacturing industry. As an advanced manufacturing technology, additive-subtractive integrated hybrid manufacturing (ASIHM) is not only suitable for manufacturing complex parts but also offers significant advantages in terms of material utilization and production efficiency. In this paper, carbon emission modeling and a case study are conducted to assess the carbon emission characteristics of ASIHM quantitatively. Firstly, the research system boundary was delineated based on the life cycle theory. Secondly, the precise model of carbon emissions was established according to the equipment operating status and process characteristics. Then, the carbon emissions of the ASIHM process were analyzed, and comparative research on the carbon emissions in material and energy consumption was also carried out with the conventional subtractive manufacturing (CSM) process. The results have revealed that ASIHM has the highest proportion of carbon emissions during the additive forming stage, reaching over 54%. Compared to conventional milling, ASIHM has an 80% lower carbon footprint. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Korean Society for Precision Engineering 2024."

Pallets play an important role in protecting and transporting over 80 % of global trade, while also bring environmental implications. Currently, research on identifying the environmental impact reduction pathway for different types of pallets in the second-largest pallet holder, China, is lacking. This study aims to provide a comprehensive framework to improve the environmental performance of the pallet industry in China. The framework is composed of three scenarios which represent the pallet system as in China today, the establishment of a pallet sharing system and the adoption of circular economy (CE). The framework is validated by adopting life cycle assessment and scenario analysis. Results show that the Chinese pallet market can achieve a remarkable environmental impact reduction by 95.2 % and 97.3 %, respectively, by adopting the sharing system and CE strategies. Especially, carbon footprint can be reduced by 95 % (from 43.23 to 2.14 billion kg CO2) under the sharing system, and by 98.1 % (to 0.8 billion kg CO2) under the CE scenario. The sharing system reduces the impacts of freshwater consumption (FC) category by 93 % (from 284.81 million m3 to 19.40 million m3) and the impacts of terrestrial ecotoxicity (TE) category by 90 % (from 18.48 billion to 1.76 billion kg 1,4-DB eq). In the CE scenario, the impacts of FC drop by 94 % (to 16.38 million m3) and the impacts of TE decrease by 99 % (to 0.27 billion kg 1,4-DB eq) compared to the base case. The study recommends prioritising measures to enhance awareness and adoption of CE, focusing on addressing tonnage loss and developing robust infrastructure for efficient pallet management. © 2024"

However, due to the limited battery power and computing resources of MD, it is critical to process more data with less energy. This article studies the Wireless Power Transfer-based Mobile Edge Computing (WPT-MEC) network system assisted by Intelligent Reflective Surface (IRS) to enhance communication performance while improving the battery life of MD. In order to maximize the Computation Energy Efficiency (CEE) of the system and reduce the carbon footprint of the MEC server, we jointly optimize the CPU frequencies of MDs and MEC server, the transmit power of Power Beacon (PB), the processing time of MEC server, the offloading time and the energy harvesting time of MDs, the local processing time and the offloading power of MD and the phase shift coefficient matrix of Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS). Moreover, we transform this joint optimization problem into a fractional programming problem. We then propose the Dinkelbach Iterative Algorithm with Gradient Updates (DIA-GU) to solve this problem effectively. With the help of convex optimization theory, we can obtain closed-form solutions, revealing the correlation between different variables. Compared to other algorithms, the DIA-GU algorithm not only exhibits superior performance in enhancing the system's CEE but also demonstrates significant reductions in carbon emissions.  © 2016 IEEE."

Methods: Baseline and 1-year follow-up data from 5800 participants in the PREDIMED-Plus study were used. Each participant's food intake was estimated using validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires, and the adherence to MD using the Dietary Score. The influence of diet on environmental impact was assessed through the EAT-Lancet Commission tables. The influence of diet on environmental impact was assessed through the EAT-Lancet Commission tables. The association between MD adherence and its environmental impact was calculated using adjusted multivariate linear regression models. Results: After one year of intervention, the kcal/day consumed was significantly reduced (−125,1 kcal/day), adherence to a MD pattern was improved (+0,9) and the environmental impact due to the diet was significantly reduced (GHG: −361 g/CO2-eq; Acidification:-11,5 g SO2-eq; Eutrophication:-4,7 g PO4-eq; Energy use:-842,7 kJ; and Land use:-2,2 m2). Higher adherence to MD (high vs. low) was significantly associated with lower environmental impact both at baseline and one year follow-up. Meat products had the greatest environmental impact in all the factors analysed, both at baseline and at one-year follow-up, in spite of the reduction observed in their consumption. Conclusions: A program promoting a MD, after one year of intervention, significantly reduced the environmental impact in all the factors analysed. Meat products had the greatest environmental impact in all the dimensions analysed. © 2024 The Author(s)"

It is advantageous for two-parametric data as well as for data with three variable parameters. One of the most crucial functions of supply chain management is to increase competitive pressure. The study's standout innovation, Multi-Attributive Ideal Real Comparative Analysis (MAIRCA), has been implemented to give powerful group decision-making. An ecological perspective is becoming more prevalent due to the competitive climate and customer perception. Green supplier selection (GSS) has become a significant issue. In this study, we address the problem of GSS, which aims for flexibility, robustness, ecological sensitivity, leanness, and feasibility. The feasibility criteria in recycling, environmental, carbon footprints, and water consumption are different from those in standard supplier selection. The aim of our work is to introduced the weighted Average/Geometric aggregation operators based on Sq-LDFSs. For this we defined some operational rules as a foundation of aggregation operators. Secondly we proposed a MAIRCA approach for Sq-LDFSs to address these issues. The MAIRCA strategy, which uses multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) to evaluate and choose traditional and environmental conventionalities, is used to reduce instability and ambiguity. The spherical q-linear Diophantine fuzzy MAIRCA approach provides comparative analysis of decision-makers and criteria. By merging Sq-LDFS and MAIRCA, a hybrid strategy is formed, successfully selecting the best provider among options based on the order of significance. These numerical examples demonstrate the suggested MCGDM approaches that were applied in actual situations, giving a realistic appreciation of their efficacy. The comparative study of the final ranking further supports the idea that these strategies are dependable in decision-making processes in addition to being practical and usable.  © 2024 - IOS Press.

193,Towards a sustainable circular economy: Understanding the environmental credits and loads of reusing modular building components from a multi-use cycle perspective,Article,Yang Y.; Zheng B.; Luk C.; Yuen K.-F.; Chan A.,Sustainable Production and Consumption,46.0,2024,543,558,10.1016/j.spc.2024.02.027,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85187955240&doi=10.1016%2fj.spc.2024.02.027&partnerID=40&md5=94b87b5c7834f18741052ae847c26956,23525509,Scopus,Design For Deconstruction; Global sensitivity analysis; Multiple use cycles; Product environmental footprint; Reusability; Value retention process,"Properly designed modular construction offers the potential for easy disassembly, relocation, and reuse across multiple use cycles. However, the environmental benefits and burdens resulting from the reuse of modular components over these cycles are not well understood. The study aimed to assess the environmental credits and loads associated with reusing modular components over multiple use cycles. This aim was achieved through two approaches. Firstly, three dedicated life cycle assessment (LCA) allocation rules were adopted, namely, cut-off with Module D, the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF), and the Circular Footprint Formula (CFF), to evaluate the environmental impacts of production, reuse, repair, replacement, recycling, and disposal of a modular unit (including the steel frame, concrete slab, and steel connector) across different life cycle stages (Module A, Module C, and Module D) and use cycles (first, intermediate, and last). The PEF approach was determined to be the most suitable for interpreting the environmental credits and burdens associated with reuse. The study found that the reuse and recycling of the modular unit resulted in approximately 9007 ± 362 kg, 2925 ± 602 kg, and 8433 ± 544 kg of equivalent carbon dioxide emissions in the first, intermediate, and last use cycles, respectively. Secondly, a global sensitivity analysis was performed to assess how uncertain input parameters related to future use cycles (e.g., reuse rate, direct reusability rate, recyclability rate, and transport distance) influenced the LCA outcomes. The results revealed that it is beneficial to achieve a higher level of reusability (i.e., direct reusability) and recyclability for the steel frame to maximize the environmental advantages. The impact associated with a relatively lower level of reusability (i.e., repairable) and recyclability for subcomponents is considered environmentally acceptable. However, the lowest level of reusability of subcomponents (i.e., replaceable) should be avoided to minimize the impact associated with replacements. With a view to ensuring net environmental benefits from reuse, it is crucial to attain the desirable reusability level through developing proper design and deconstruction strategies for individual modular components. © 2024 Institution of Chemical Engineers"

India has witnessed a significant surge in greenhouse gas emissions due to rapid economic growth and population expansion, making it the world's third-largest CO2 emitter. This upsurge intensifies the natural greenhouse effect, leading to global temperature rise, ocean acidification, and heightened risks to human health. Objectives: To assess the Carbon Footprint generated by urban households of Vijayapura. Material and methods: This study employs a cross-sectional approach targeting urban households residing within the operational area of the urban health center in BLDE(DU), Vijayapura City. The sample, comprising 150 households, was selected via systematic random sampling. Data was collected through household visits and interviews with the family heads using a semi-structured questionnaire. and analyzed utilizing SPSS Software Version 26. Results: The analysis of carbon emissions highlights that primary emissions surpass secondary emissions. Notably, households categorized under the upper socioeconomic class exhibit a statistically significant carbon emission rate of approximately 39.47 tonnes per month. Conclusion: This study's assessment of the carbon footprint emanating from urban households illuminates the pivotal connection between day-to-day choices and the broader ecological context. © The Author(s). 2024 Open Access."

A pilot plant was operated with feedstock from a fruit and vegetable processing industry and its final products were assessed. The pilot plant was powered by renewable energy (solar energy supported by biomass), which minimized the carbon footprint and operating costs of the process. Through the ultimate analysis of the produced algae, it was evident that in all cases it could be commercialized as a solid NPK organic fertilizer being in line with the respective EU and Spanish legislation framework. As far as the animal feed perspective is concerned, the end-product of the pilot plant could be efficiently included in the feed of various animals, substituting a significant part of the animal feed required. The results from the implementation were used for the design of a full-scale implementation of the innovative treatment scheme, proving that 1.26 ton/d of microalgae could be produced, which could be later used as fertiliser and/or animal feed from the daily wastewater production of a medium sized fruit and vegetable processing company. From an environmental perspective, the proposed solution provides a gold standard example of the circular economy concept, since 1.15 kg CO2 equivalent per kg of sludge avoided could be saved. Additionally, the use of renewable energy (solar and biomass) will result in a saving of 0.531 kg of CO2 emissions per kWh consumed. Conclusively, the proposed treatment scheme could meet circularity and sustainability since the end-products quality permits their integration into new value chains. © The Author(s) 2023."

However, carbon accounting inaccuracies, ambiguous emissions disclosures and unambitious climate targets are hampering these aspirations. This paper reports on the disparity between high-level guidance and practical implementation of carbon accounting and reporting at company level. By conducting a systematic literature analysis and focussing on the English Water sector, we utilise case study data from Northumbrian Water Limited (NWL), to identify limitations in the current guidance and frameworks. The results indicate the necessity for enhanced alignment in high-level guidance, particularly regarding the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and the Science-Based Target Initiative. It is evident that clarity and consistency from high-level resources are essential for climate mitigation. This paper shows, depending on the sector and company types, that different benefits are gained from using the available resources. We propose a carbon measurement and management process for the English Water sector (and beyond) to reach net zero targets and make recommendations for decision makers. This helps to understand best practices of carbon accounting and reporting and to make effective investment decisions. Consequently, we advocate for policy interventions to improve the standardisation of carbon accounting models. Harmonising international regulatory frameworks and standards is needed, which will empower organisations to effectively assess, manage and reduce their carbon footprints. © 2023 The Authors.

Currently, terrestrial data centers consume a significant amount of energy, estimated at about 1.5% of worldwide electricity use. Furthermore, the increasing demand for data-intensive applications is expected to raise energy consumption, making it crucial to consider sustainable computing paradigms. In this study, we propose a data center-enabled High Altitude Platform (HAP) system, where a flying data center supports the operation of terrestrial data centers. We conduct a detailed analytical study to assess the energy benefits and communication requirements of this approach. Our findings demonstrate that a data center-enabled HAP is more energy-efficient than a traditional terrestrial data center, owing to the naturally low temperature in the stratosphere and the ability to harvest solar energy. Adopting a data center-HAP can save up to 14% of energy requirements while overcoming the offloading outage problem and the associated delay resulting from server distribution. Our study highlights the potential of a data center-enabled HAP system as a sustainable computing solution to meet the growing energy demands and reduce carbon footprint.  © 2023 IEEE."

We employed CIPS (cross-sectional Im, Pesaran, and Shin) unit root tests, CS-ARDL (cross-sectional augmented distributed lag (CS-ARDL), FMOLS (fully modified ordinary least squares), and DOLS (dynamic ordinary least squares) for the empirical examination of the data. The long-run estimates exhibit that institutional quality, financial development, and health expenditure variables contribute to longer life expectancy, while carbon emissions, ecological footprint, birth rate, mortality rate, and population growth reduce life expectancy in the selected Asian countries. Based on these findings, we propose that financial sector strengthening, increase in healthcare budget allocation, the adoption of clean and green technology and stringent environmental pollution regulatory policies are vital for improving life expectancy and overall human well-being and achieving the ultimate goals of sustainable development. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023."

They are also combined with two nanosilicas with different specific surface area (O and A). Blends of alone M or G and with nanosilica are mixed in water with Ca(OH)2 and chloride (C) to compare chloride binding capacity of both in presence or not of nanosilica. Blends are analysed by XRD, FTIR, DTA–TG and chloride binding capacity is determined too by potentriometric titration with AgNO3. The addition of chlorides to both pozzolanic M and G indicates that M shows higher chloride binding capacity than G although very similar Friedel's salt formation, indicating a higher physisorbed chlorides contain. Chlorides addition meaningfully replaces carbonates in carboaluminates phases to form Friedel's salt, being this exchange higher for samples with M than for G blends. The combination of experimental techniques used in this study have shown that the effect of nanosilica addition to samples with M and G show an opposite effect in Friedel's salt formation, increasing for samples with G and decreasing for samples that contain M. © 2023 The Authors"

Blockchain and carbon neutrality, each can be expensive to adopt and complex to manage, thus getting the “truth” on decarbonization may require additional costs for consumers. Design/methodology/approach: Experimental modeling is used to address these critical and emergent issues that influence practices across a set of supply chain actors. Three hypotheses relating to the relationship between blockchain-supported carbon offset information and consumer perceptions and intentions associated with the product and supply chain actors are investigated. Findings: The results show that consumer confidence increases when supply chain carbon offset information has greater reliability, transparency and traceability as supported by blockchain technology. The authors also find that consumers who are provided visibility into various shipping options and the product's journey carbon emissions and offset – from a blockchain-supported system – they are more willing to pay a premium for both the product and shipping options. Blockchain-supported decarbonization information disclosure in the supply chain can lead to organizational legitimacy and financial gains in return. Originality/value: Understanding consumer action and sustainable consumption is critical for organizations seeking carbon neutrality. Currently, the literature on this understanding from a consumer information provision is not well understood, especially with respect to blockchain-supported information transparency, visibility and reliability. Much of the blockchain literature focuses on the upstream. This study focuses more on consumer-level and downstream supply chain blockchain implications for organizations. The study provides a practical roadmap for considering levels of blockchain information activity and consumer interaction. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."

The main objective of this evaluation is to examine the effects of different degrees of decentralization in production networks of the chemical industry. Using the production of a biopolymer as an example, the study includes strategic supply chain planning by agent-based simulations, economic evaluation by calculation of net present values and environmental assessment by calculation of carbon footprints. By allowing for dynamic reconfiguration of the decentralized networks over time, it is shown that mobile, modular plant concepts are beneficial to reduce supply chain expenses. Transportation efforts resulting from strategic supply chain planning are reduced by 40 % with increasing degree of decentralization. The profitability of the decentralized networks is dominated by the costs for the production processes themselves as capital and operational expenditures allocate to >50 % of the total costs. Product prices of 3000 to 5500 €2020 per ton are necessary to reach profitability of the decentralized production networks. Regarding the environmental assessment, the carbon footprint of the supply chain accounts for <3 % of the total emissions, which are dominated by the provision of process heat that accounts for 46 to 68 % of the total emissions. Carbon footprint of the decentral production networks can be significantly reduced by a systematic electrification of 90 % of the process heat demand. © 2024 The Authors"

The research unfolded in the Kalyani Sub-division of West Bengal, India, encompassing both urban and rural landscapes. Data collection entailed comprehensive interviews with 610 households during the period spanning December 2021–May 2022. Statistical analysis was rigorously executed through SPSS, while carbon footprint computations drew upon the well-regarded Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emission accounting methodology. Analysing global carbon dioxide emissions spanning 1850–2011, the study underscores the alarming surge in emissions driven by industrialization and non-renewable energy consumption. The ensuing disparities in emissions across nations and regions are attributed to socioeconomic factors, urbanization, and individual lifestyle choices. It becomes evident that socioeconomic status, education, and gender roles exert significant influence over energy consumption behaviour, with higher educational attainment correlating with heightened environmental awareness. Simultaneously, income inequality acts as a structural constraint, limiting sustainable behaviour adoption. Education emerges as a potent tool in mitigating structural limitations, challenging traditional gender norms, and addressing income disparities are deemed essential for universal access to sustainable practices. This research urges the formulation of context-specific interventions and policies to tackle the multifaceted drivers of carbon emissions, providing policymakers and practitioners with valuable insights into promoting environmental sustainability. Future research should delve into diverse sociocultural contexts and rigorously assess intervention efficacy, enriching our understanding of the complex interplay between habits, structural constraints, and carbon emissions, and guiding us towards a more sustainable and equitable future. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023."

Likewise, the influence of renewable energy (RWN), economic complexity (ECI) and environmental control technology (EVT) on EQ is still unsettled. Thus, based on arrays of pollution metrics (ecological footprint (ECF), carbon emission damage (CO2D) and consumption-based carbon emissions (CCO2) and annual panel series spanning 1990–2018, this study provides fresh insights into the implications of the listed variables on EQs in E7 countries. Accordingly, the following empirical narratives were established: (i) The effects of the enlisted panel series on EQ are sensitive to the peculiarities of each pollution metric. (ii) Estimates of the pool mean group autoregressive distributed lag (PMG-ARDL) model and those of cross-sectional augmented autoregressive distributed lag (CS-ARDL) underscore the important roles of ENS and RWN on EQ, particularly on ECF; and ECI on CO2D. While EVT provides insignificant carbon emission reducing effects across all variants of EQ indicators, population and economic growth are all time-significant pollution enablers. (iii) The outcomes of the panel quantile regression demonstrate that ENS enhances EQ only at the 25th and 50th quantiles and accelerates pollution at the 75th and 95th quantiles. RWN enhances EQ across all quantiles while ECI deaccelerates ECF and CO2D and accelerates CCO2 across all quantiles. Furthermore, EVT accelerates ECF and CO2D while it deaccelerates CCO2 across all quantiles. Meanwhile, the unpleasant effects of growth and population are reemphasized. Policy strategies to ensure a sustainable environment in E7 have been highlighted. © The Author(s) 2022."

Though previous studies concerning life cycle assessment (LCA) of oil and gas pipelines have estimated the carbon footprint to some extent, there is a lack of research on life cycle carbon emissions that take the process of crude oil pipelines transportation. the main objective of this study is to build a comprehensive LCA model of carbon footprint for crude oil pipeline systems. A gate-to-gate analysis is provided for the LCA model, which means that the entire pipeline's life cycle from the extraction to disposal is considered. The LCA approach used both midpoint and endpoint impact assessment methods to evaluate the environmental impacts of crude oil pipeline transportation in Iran. The study analyzed the major environmental impact categories, such as greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, water usage, and solid waste generation. The results showed that the crude oil pipelines transportation has significant environmental impacts in Iran. The three highest impacts on the midpoint scale are marine ecotoxicity by 61.54 kg 1,4-DCB, terrestrial ecotoxicity by 52.26 kg 1,4-DCB and fossil resource scarcity by 40.22 kg oil eq. The endpoint impacts of three stations were also compared. The Chamran, Abadan and Zanganeh stations have 95.44%, 94.22%, and 6% impacts on human health, respectively. Also, Abadan station has the largest amount of damage to ecosystems and resources with 96.65% and 80.02%, respectively. The findings of this study could be used by policymakers, oil companies, and other stakeholders to make informed decisions and implement strategies to reduce the environmental impact of oil transportation in Iran. © 2024 The Authors.

Historically, this transfer of constructive information has been a manual task that the designer has had to face, often through the generalization and simplification of the energy models. This document describes a methodology and a proprietary free web application (IMIP-webapp), which enables the reading of information contained in IFC and GBXML files, and incorporates, in an automated manner, the necessary data into the energy model, facilitating its rating, contributing to its evaluation, improving its energy performance, and, consequently, reducing its carbon footprint. The application has been successfully evaluated based on case studies and pilot tests conducted over the course of the IMIP project (Innovative Eco-Construction System Based on Interlocking Modular Insulation Wood & Cork-Based Panels), simulated energetically with the assistance of the tool. This approach represents a new strategy in the fight against climate change as it: (a) reduces the working time in energy certification processes; (b) facilitates the interaction between different digital models promoting a more informed decision-making process in environmental design, which ultimately should contribute to reducing the impact of public and private buildings in Southwestern Europe. © 2024 Universidad Politecnica de Valencia..

Therefore, life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) can provide a more holistic framework for performance evaluation than the conventional approach. This study added water footprint (WF) to LCIA and defined ϕ index for accounting for the damage ratio of carbon footprint (CF) to WF. The application of these innovations was verified by comparing the performance of 26 WWTPs. These facilities are located in four different climates in Iran, serve between 1,900 and 980,000 people, and have treatment units like activated sludge, aerated lagoon, and stabilization pond. Here, grey water footprint (GWF) calculated the ecological impacts through typical pollutants. Blue water footprint (BWF) included the productive impacts of wastewater reuse, and CF estimated CO2 emissions from WWTPs. Results showed that GWF was the leading factor. ϕ was 4–7.5% and the average WF of WWTPs was 0.6 m3/ca, which reduced 84%, to 0.1 m3/ca, through wastewater reuse. Here, wastewater treatment and reuse in larger WWTPs, particularly with activated sludge had lower cumulative impacts. Since this method takes more items than the conventional approach, it is recommended for integrated evaluation of WWTPs, mainly in areas where the water–energy nexus is a paradigm for sustainable development. © 2024 IWA Publishing.

However, the lack of systematic evaluation at a fine scale presents considerable challenges in guiding localized strategies for mitigating GHG emissions from crop production. Here, we analyzed the county-level carbon footprint (CF) of China’s rice production from 2007 to 2018 by coupling life cycle assessment and the DNDC model. Results revealed a significant annual increase of 74.3 kg CO2-eq ha-1 in the average farm-based CF (FCF), while it remained stable for the product-based CF (PCF). The CF exhibited considerable variations among counties, ranging from 2324 to 20,768 kg CO2-eq ha-1 for FCF and from 0.36 to 3.81 kg CO2-eq kg-1 for PCF in 2018. The spatiotemporal heterogeneities of FCF were predominantly influenced by field CH4 emissions, followed by diesel consumption and soil organic carbon sequestration. Scenario analysis elucidates that the national total GHG emissions from rice production could be significantly reduced through optimized irrigation (48.5%) and straw-based biogas production (18.0%). Moreover, integrating additional strategies (e.g., advanced crop management, optimized fertilization, and biodiesel application) could amplify the overall emission reduction to 76.7% while concurrently boosting the rice yield by 11.8%. Our county-level research provides valuable insights for the formulation of targeted GHG mitigation policies in rice production, thereby advancing the pursuit of carbon-neutral agricultural practices. © 2024 American Chemical Society."

This paper introduces a decoupled quad-active-bridge converter (QAB) with multi-directional power flow capability, which can integrate PV, energy storage (ES), grid, and EV in a charging station and rule the power among them. As the number of ports increases in the multiple-active-bridge converter, the complexity of control increases exponentially because of power decoupling. For the QAB, by tuning one port in series with LC units, the decoupling is achieved between the other three ports, reducing the control difficulty significantly. Further, the resonance decoupling method is extended to the n-port converter. For different power flows, the system automatically switches between different resonance modes to form higher-efficiency power flow channels. Three operating modes with decoupled closed-loop control methods have been constructed for the QAB to be suitable for future charging stations: (1) Charging mode: PV, ES, and grid coordinate with each other to provide incessant and stable charging for EV. (2) Electricity sales mode: Gird is supplied by PV, ES, and EV flexibly. (3) Under no load, PV power is stored locally. Experimental waveforms were presented by a 1-kW prototype, verifying the effectiveness of power decoupling and the feasibility of the three operating modes. © 2024 The Authors.

A life cycle assessment (LCA) of the SRF production from non-recyclable and selected waste was conducted in an Italian mechanical treatment plant to estimate the potential environmental impacts per ton of SRF produced. The analysis would contribute to evaluate the benefits that can be obtained due to coke substitution in best- and worst-case scenarios. The avoided impacts achieved were assessed, together with an evaluation of the variables that can affect the environmental benefits: SRF biogenic carbon content (in percentage of paper and cardboard); transportation distances travelled from the treatment plant to the cement kiln; the renewable energy used in the mechanical facility. On average, about 35.6 kgCO2-eq are generated by the SRF transportation and production phase. These impacts are greatly compensated by coke substitution, obtaining a net value of about −1.1 tCO2-eq avoided per ton of SRF. On balance, the global warming potential due to SRF production and consumption ranges from about −542 kgCO2-eq to about −1729 kgCO2-eq. The research recommended the use of SRF to substitute coke in cement kilns also in low densely-populated areas to mitigate environmental impacts and achieve carbon neutrality at a global level. © 2024 The Authors"

Biogas from agricultural and municipal organic waste is gaining momentum as a renewable energy source. Concurrently, the European Hydrogen Strategy focuses on green hydrogen for decarbonising the industrial and transportation sectors. This paper presents a multi-objective network design model for urban–industrial symbiosis, incorporating anaerobic digestion, cogeneration, photovoltaic, and hydrogen production technologies. Additionally, a Bayesian best-worst method is used to evaluate the weights of the sustainability aspects by decision-makers, integrating these into the mathematical model. The model optimises industrial plant locations considering economic, environmental, and social parameters, including the net present value, energy consumption, and carbon footprint. The model’s functionalities are demonstrated through a real-world case study based in Emilia Romagna, Italy. It is subject to sensitivity analysis to evaluate how changes in the inputs affect the outcomes and highlights feasible trade-offs through the exploration of the (Formula presented.) -constraint. The findings demonstrate that the model substantially boosts energy and hydrogen production. It is not only economically viable but also reduces the carbon footprint associated with fossil fuels and landfilling. Additionally, it contributes to job creation.

Previous papers have analysed and recommended measures to reduce road transport's negative environmental impact and carbon footprint. However, some restrictions are impossible (or very costly) to meet, even in developed countries. Unfortunately, presenting the impact of transport on air pollution levels as a whole can only give a general picture. This paper provides a more detailed analysis and attempts to assess the impact of one of the most important elements shaping modern transport, that is, vehicle engine types. Thus, the main objective of the study is to analyse and evaluate the different types of engines in vehicles from the point of view of technical, environmental, and economic aspects in European countries and to verify whether Europe is ready to implement the European Green Deal. The results indicate significant technological developments must occur in electric vehicles to become environmentally better than combustion engine-based cars. Additionally, in the case of some developing countries, owning a means of transport is still perceived as a symbol of a certain status, which is why it is still an important material asset. Thus, in rich countries, material status and environmental awareness (e.g. choice of public transport) will help to achieve climate neutrality, while poorer countries (even developed ones) may have severe problems in meeting EU requirements. Overall, while answering some questions, this article also poses new ones. Decision-makers often face challenging aspects. This article is intended to give them a basic knowledge to pursue an environmental policy that is viable and feasible for all countries.  © 2024 Kamil Maciuk et al., published by Sciendo."

This study employs a combination of machine learning (gradient boosting regression, GBR) and spatial analysis to better understand the key drivers behind air pollution and its prediction and mitigation strategies. Focusing on New York City as a representative urban area, we investigate the interplay between urban characteristics and weather factors, showing that urban features, including traffic-related parameters and urban morphology, emerge as crucial predictors for pollutants closely associated with vehicular emissions, such as elemental carbon (EC) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Conversely, pollutants with secondary formation pathways (e.g., PM2.5) or stemming from nontraffic sources (e.g., sulfur dioxide, SO2) are predominantly influenced by meteorological conditions, particularly wind speed and maximum daily temperature. Urban characteristics are shown to act over spatial scales of 500 × 500 m2, which is thus the footprint needed to effectively capture the impact of urban form, fabric, and function. Our spatial predictive model, needing only meteorological and urban inputs, achieves promising results with mean absolute errors ranging from 8 to 32% when using full-year data. Our approach also yields good performance when applied to the temporal mapping of spatial pollutant variability. Our findings highlight the interacting roles of urban characteristics and weather conditions and can inform urban planning, design, and policy. © 2024 American Chemical Society."

Building on Chan (2021), this study aims to explore what drives Australian accommodation providers to measure the carbon footprint of their businesses and what barriers hinder them from doing so. Design/methodology/approach: Empirical data were collected by conducting ten semi-structured interviews with owners, senior executives, consultants, certification bodies and hotel management companies. The set of interviews represented different segments of the hotel industry and various accommodation types. Data were analysed with thematic analysis. Findings: The major drivers for adopting carbon footprint analysis are as follows: the analysis being perceived as an important contribution to a company's corporate responsibility, the owner or manager's environmental concern, the assessment being a requirement for obtaining an eco-certification and the business benefits associated with implementing the initiative. The major barriers hindering adoption include the following: difficulties with data gathering, the lack of a standard methodology, a lengthy decision-making process and a lack of resources. Research limitations/implications: Based on the empirical findings and three theories on ecological responsiveness, this study develops a conceptual framework for implementing carbon footprint analysis in the accommodation context and recommends strategies to increase the adoption of carbon footprint analysis. Originality/value: This study responds to Chan and Hsu's (2016) call for further research on carbon footprint in the hotel context and represents the first attempt to explore the drivers and barriers specifically associated with implementing carbon footprint analysis in the accommodation sector. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Design/methodology/approach: A discrete choice experiment questionnaire was administered to a sample of 958 Hong Kong respondents. Hybrid choice modeling was used to examine the respondents’ preferences for destination attributes and to explain preference heterogeneity using tourists’ climate change perceptions. The respondents’ willingness to pay for the destination attributes was also calculated to measure the monetary value of the attributes. Findings: Destination type, carbon emissions and travel cost had significant effects on tourists’ choices of destination. Nudging increased tourists’ preference for low-carbon footprint choices. Tourists with higher climate change perceptions were more likely than others to select low-carbon destinations with carbon offset projects. Practical implications: The findings of this study provide an impetus for destination management organizations to support local carbon offset projects, implement policies that mitigate carbon emissions and develop sustainable tourism to fulfill tourists’ demand for low-carbon footprint travel choices. Based on the findings, policymakers could promote sustainable tourism by publishing relevant climate change information on social media. Originality/value: This study addressed a gap in the literature on tourist travel choice by considering carbon emission-related attributes and climate change perceptions and by confirming the role of nudging in increasing the choice of low-carbon destinations. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Thereby, the wastewater rich in urea from sanitary units, and industries are subjected to produce green energy as a source for hydrogen through waste water-splitting. Thus, anodic reaction in electrochemical hydrogen production is the most widely promoted towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). However, both possess sluggish kinetics which need to be improved. Therefore, the development of novel materials that can meet the demands of both reaction mechanisms is highly required. Herein, Fe2P2O7-based composite grown on the conductive substrate can effectively enhance the electrical transportation of ions during electrocatalytic activity. The experimental and theoretical investigations are adopted to get a comprehensive insight and understanding of the catalytic nature of the as-prepared samples. Compared with other as-synthesized materials, Fe2P2O7 exhibits splendid performance with a low onset potential of 1.482 and 1.317 V (vs RHE) to obtain a current density of 10 mA/cm2 towards the OER and UOR process, respectively. The low Tafel slope and high turnover frequency offer low resistance during charge transfer. Additionally, greater ECSA and roughness factors enrich the attributes of Fe2P2O7 and offer more active sites for reaction to be held, producing a higher amount of gas bubbles. Hence, improved electrical conductivity, low charge transfer resistance, more electrochemical active surface area, and impressive durability reconfirm the Fe2P2O7 as an effective catalyst. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC"

The huge electricity demand and the associated carbon emissions of DCs have great impacts on power system reliability and environmental sustainability. This paper proposes a bilevel model for low-carbon operation of DCs via carbon-integrated locational marginal prices (CLMPs). In the upper level, the power system operator sequentially solves the optimal power flow and the carbon emission flow problems to determine the CLMPs. In the lower level, a joint workload sharing and carbon trading model for DCs is developed to minimize their overall operation cost while keeping each DC's carbon footprint within its carbon allowance. To solve the bilevel model and preserve the privacy of DCs, we propose a bisection-embedded iterative method. It can tackle the issue of oscillation, thereby ensuring convergence. In addition, a filtering mechanism-based distributed algorithm is proposed to solve the lower-level DC problem in a distributed manner with much reduced communication overhead. Case studies on both small-scale and large-scale systems demonstrate the effectiveness and benefits of the proposed method.  © 2013 IEEE."

We wanted to review the existing literature about carbon footprint of flexible cystoscopy and analyze the environmental impact of the Isiris® (Coloplast©) single-use flexible cystoscope compared to reusable flexible cystoscopes. Methods: First, a systematic review on single-use and reusable cystoscope carbon footprint was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Second, carbon footprints of Isiris single-use flexible cystoscope and reusable cystoscope were analyzed and compared. Life cycle of the single-use flexible cystoscope was divided in three steps: manufacturing, sterilization, and disposal. For the reusable cystoscope, several steps were considered to estimate the carbon footprint over the life cycle: manufacturing, washing/sterilization, repackaging, repair, and disposal. For each step, the carbon footprint values were collected and adapted from previous comparable published data on flexible ureteroscope. Results: The systematic literature review evidenced total carbon emissions within a range of 2.06 to 2.41 kg carbon dioxide (CO2) per each use of single-use flexible cystoscope compared to a wide range of 0.53 to 4.23 kg CO2 per each case of reusable flexible cystoscope. The carbon footprint comparative analysis between Isiris single-use flexible cystoscope and reusable cystoscope concluded in favor of the single-use cystoscope. Based on our calculation, the total carbon emissions for a reusable flexible cystoscope could be refined to an estimated range of 2.40 to 3.99 kg CO2 per case, depending on the endoscopic activity of the unit, and to 1.76 kg CO2 per case for Isiris single-use cystoscope. Conclusion: The results and our systematic literature review demonstrated disparate results depending on the calculation method used for carbon footprint analysis. However, the results tend rather toward a lower environmental impact of single-use devices. In comparison to a reusable flexible cystoscope, Isiris compared favorably in terms of carbon footprint.

In-person conferences provide a unique social and professional platform to engage in networking and foster professional development; however, there is an opportunity for hybrid and virtual platforms to provide CME for broader audiences looking to improve their clinical skills and strengthen their knowledge base. This study seeks to describe the reduction in carbon emissions associated with a webinar hosted by an online dermatology-focused medical education platform. Methods: This cross-sectional study used the location of deidentified virtual attendees of a webinar to predict the carbon emissions produced if attendees had instead traveled to the location of the most recent Integrative Dermatology Symposium (Sacramento, CA). Following collection of each virtual attendee’s location, the mode of transportation was predicted on the basis of each participant’s distance to the conference. Results: The estimated carbon emissions were calculated for 576 participants. The total estimated, unadjusted carbon emissions for both attendees predicted to fly or drive was 370,100 kg CO2. The emissions produced per participant from those expected to fly to an in-person CME after adjusting for all additional passengers on every flight were 4.5 kg CO2. The emissions produced per participant from those expected to drive were 42.7 kg CO2. Conclusion: The use of a virtual CME webinar led to a significant reduction in travel-related carbon dioxide emissions when compared to running the same program in-person event. When accounting for all passengers traveling via plane on any flight, driving to an event produced more emissions per participant than flying. © The Author(s) 2024."

In the department of Cundinamarca, specialized dairy farms located in the high tropics contribute 14% of the national milk production, and 94% of them are small-scale producers. Therefore, mitigation strategies for dairy farms are needed to achieve national GHGE reduction targets. This study aims to quantify the carbon footprint (CF), through a Life cycle Assessment Methodology, of 82 specialized dairy farms at the farm gate in 3 regions of Cundinamarca: Central Savannah, West Savannah and Ubate Valley; and to identify the contribution of Acacia decurrens, Baccharis latifolia, and Sambucus peruviana to milk production increases and GHGE mitigation potential. The comparison of the effect of the tree species on the measured variables was carried out by analysis of variance under a completely random design. GHGE were calculated using the 2019 Refinement to 2006 IPCC guidelines and impact factors from databases. The emission factor for enteric methane from cows was estimated by considering the equation proposed by Niu et al. (Glob Chang Biol 24:3368–3389, 2018). The functional units corresponded to one kg fat and protein-corrected milk (FPCM) and one kg live weight gain in a cradle-to-farm-gate approach. For the 3 regions, enteric fermentation and manure left on pasture were the main on-farm sources of GHGE, and feed manufacturing was the main off-farm source. Milk CFs ranged from 1.5 to 2.2 kg CO2-eq kg FPCM−1. The inclusion Acacia decurrens, Baccharis latifolia, and Sambucus peruviana in cattle diets reduced the milk CF by 13–26% and increased milk yield by 19–37% in the three regions. Therefore, the inclusion of locally available forages in dairy cattle diets is a potential sustainable GHGE mitigation option that dairy farmers, from the Colombian high tropics, can adopt. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024."

The main focus was to elucidate opportunities for sustainability in terms of decreasing resource utilization in the textile sector. On-site surveys and detailed data collection studies were carried out at 150 textile facilities. Average specific values for water, auxiliary chemicals, dyestuff, electricity, and steam consumptions, and related reduction potentials were calculated and compared within facilities and sub-sectors. The minimum specific resource consumption values reported in the Best Available Techniques Reference Document (BREF) for the textile industry and data of similar facilities from the literature were evaluated and used. A detailed environmental performance profile of the Turkish textile sector in terms of resource usage and reduction potential was generated. The highest specific water consumption was found in the wool-woven fabric sub-sector (345 ± 262 L/kg product). Although the specific auxiliary chemical consumption shows similarities within sub-sectors, the highest specific auxiliary chemical consumption (397 ± 237 g/kg product) was found in the synthetic woven fabric sub-sector. The sub-sector with the highest specific dyestuff consumption (30 ± 13 g/kg product) was the cotton knitted fabric sub-sector. The wool woven fabric industry had the highest specific electricity (7 ± 5.3 kWh/kg product) and steam (20 ± 11 kg steam/kg product) consumption. In addition, for all the studied sub-sectors country-wide, the lowest and highest reduction potentials in resource uses were 18 ± 15% and 73 ± 13%, respectively, suggesting a need for major full-scale implementations of cleaner production for enhancing sustainability in the textile industry. © The Author(s) 2024."

This article incorporates technological innovation, militarization, and environmental change into a unified analytical framework to assess the potential impact of technological progress and defense military expenditure on the environment in BRICS countries. Based on CSD tests, unit root tests, and cointegration tests, this study constructs a CS-ARDL model to examine the long-term and short-term relationships among various variables from 1990 to 2021. The results show that technological innovation, military expenditure, and economic growth can significantly increase ecological footprint in the long run, while in the short term, technological innovation and economic growth significantly increase ecological footprint, and the impact of military expenditure is not significant. It is suggested that BRICS countries should focus on supporting low-carbon technology policies and research and development investment, while also considering the use of cutting-edge technology to improve military intelligence capabilities in order to reduce the negative impact of technological innovation and military activities on the environment. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024."

Additionally, energy used in the operating theater (scope 2 emissions) contributes to anesthesia-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Objectives: Optimizing the electricity use of medical devices might reduce both GHG emissions and costs might hold potential to reduce anaesthesia-related GHG-emissions and costs. We analyzed the electricity consumption of six different anesthesia workstations, calculated their GHG emissions and electricity costs and investigated the potential to reduce emissions and cost by using the devices in a more efficient way. Methods: Power consumption (active power in watt, W) was measured with the devices off, in standby mode, or fully on with the measuring instrument SecuLife ST. Devices studied were: Dräger Primus, Löwenstein Medical LeonPlus, Getinge Flow C, Getinge Flow E, GE Carestation 750 and GE Aisys. Calculations of GHG emissions were made with different emission factors, ranging from very low (0.09 kg CO2-equivalent/kWh) to very high (0.660 kg CO2-equivalent/kWh). Calculations of electricity cost were made assuming a price of 0.25 € per kWh. Results: Power consumption during operation varied from 58 W (GE CareStation 750) to 136 W (Dräger Primus). In standby, the devices consumed between 88% and 93% of the electricity needed during use. The annual electricity consumption to run 96 devices in a large clinical department ranges between 45 and 105 Megawatt-hours (MWh) when the devices are left in standby during off hours. If 80% of the devices are switched off during off hours, between 20 and 46 MWh can be saved per year in a single institution. At the average emission factor of our hospital, this electricity saving corresponds to a reduction of GHG emissions between 8.5 and 19.8 tons CO2-equivalent. At the assumed prices, a cost reduction between 5000 € and 11,600 € could be achieved by this intervention. Conclusion: The power consumption varies considerably between the different types of anesthesia workstations. All devices exhibit a high electricity consumption in standby mode. Avoiding standby mode during off hours can save energy and thus GHG emissions and cost. The reductions in GHG emissions and electricity cost that can be achieved with this intervention in a large anesthesiology department are modest. Compared with GHG emissions generated by volatile anesthetics, particularly desflurane, optimization of electricity consumption of anesthesia workstations holds a much smaller potential to reduce the carbon footprint of anesthesia; however, as switching off anesthesia workstations overnight is relatively effortless, this behavioral change should be encouraged from both an ecological and economical point of view. © The Author(s) 2024."

The reduced size of micro-CPV provides several advantages over conventional CPV, including shorter optical paths and lower temperature and resistive losses in the cell, resulting in higher electrical efficiencies. This may increase the energy yield per area compared to conventional CPV or silicon modules. Cost reduction is achieved through material savings and the use of continuous manufacturing methods enabled by the tiny size of cells and optics, such as roll-to-roll (R2R) and roll-to-plate (R2P) ultraviolet (UV) imprinting for optics production. However, adapting these processes to large-area arrays of Fresnel micro-lenses with no wasted areas and high efficiency remains a challenge. In this study, we present a comprehensive methodology for the development of micro-CPV optics with full area coverage—from design and mastering to up-scaling, tooling, and replication. The methodology involves designing a non-rotationally symmetric elementary insert tailored to ultraviolet imprinting. Crucially, multiple inserts are originated via precision machining and recombined to form a single array master mold without wasted areas. The master is then replicated into a flexible working stamp for UV imprinting of Fresnel lens arrays, utilizing different UV curable materials. The functional characterization of the lenses demonstrates an optical efficiency of 80% at 178X under collimated white light, representing the highest effective concentration achieved using UV-imprinted Fresnel lenses. Furthermore, initial reliability tests confirm the absence of degradation during thermal cycling or outdoor exposure. This methodology paves the way for continuous high-throughput manufacturing of micro-lens arrays using R2R or R2P methods, presenting a significant step forward in micro-CPV. © The Author(s) 2024."

One of such actions are know-as-you-throw (KAYT) schemes, which aim to change the behaviour of waste generators through tailored communication of information. KAYT schemes offer a relatively uncontroversial and simple tool, yet their environmental and economic performance remains unknown due to their limited implementation. To fill this gap, the LIFE-funded REthinkWASTE project applied a novel KAYT scheme in four pilot areas in Italy and Spain. The results of such pilots were evaluated in terms of carbon footprint and life-cycle costs of municipal waste management. The carbon footprint was notably reduced in all pilot areas, ranging from a 46% to 19% reduction, mainly due to notable reductions in unsorted waste (between 10 and 17% reduction) and subsequent lower treatment impacts. Life-cycle costs slightly increased overall, ranging from 4.6% to a −0.4% change. In addition to various sources of uncertainty, self-selection and recency biases are highlighted as major sources for potentially overestimating the benefits of KAYT in the context of large-scale and long-term KAYT implementation. The results however consistently show that the additional carbon footprint from KAYT actions can be offset with less than a 5% reduction in unsorted waste, well below the observed values. The results robustly reveal the potential of KAYT to notably reduce the carbon footprint of waste management systems with limited investment of economic resources. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Telehealth visits have been found to mitigate carbon emissions by reducing patient and physician transport. Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC) is the most rural academic medical center in the country, serving a population where the majority of patients reach the hospital by car. No large study or systematic review has evaluated the impact of telehealth visits on CO2 emissions (CO2e) across multiple specialties in a purely rural setting. Further, no sizable rurally focused study has compared CO2e avoided during the various stages of the pandemic. Methods: We extracted data for all outpatient telehealth visits at DHMC from three periods: prepandemic, early pandemic, and late pandemic. The extracted data included the pandemic stage of the virtual visit, the type of visit (video or telephone), the specialty, and the distance from the patient's home to DHMC. Results: The total CO2e avoided among all three pandemic stages analyzed in this study was 23,658,898 kg (n = 251,832). During period 1, the mean driving distance = 159.0 miles; CO2e avoided per encounter = 128.3 kg; period 2, mean distance = 84.85 miles; average CO2e avoided per encounter = 68.47 CO2e kg; and period 3, mean distance = 112.9 miles; average CO2e avoided per encounter = 91.08 kg. Conclusions: This data supported long distances to the medical center and large savings in CO2e avoided across multiple specialties that spanned all pandemic periods. Further, this level of averted emissions could translate to over $3M in saved fuel costs and the avoidance of six excess deaths. While discussions of the future of telehealth commonly focus on access, use cases, technology, costs, and satisfaction, the impact on carbon footprint is an additional important metric, particularly in largely rural regions.

These strategies mainly include both sustainable energy supplies and the conversion of CO2 in downstream processes. This study developed a coupled process of biomass chemical looping H2 production and reductive calcination of CaCO3. Firstly, a mass and energy balance of the coupled process was established in Aspen Plus. Following this, process optimization and energy integration were implemented to provide optimized operation conditions. Lastly, a life cycle assessment was carried out to assess the carbon footprint of the coupled process. Results reveal that the decomposition temperature of CaCO3 in an H2 atmosphere can be reduced to 780 °C (generally around 900 °C), and the conversion of CO2 from CaCO3 decomposition reached 81.33% with an H2:CO ratio of 2.49 in gaseous products. By optimizing systemic energy through heat integration, an energy efficiency of 86.30% was achieved. Additionally, the carbon footprint analysis revealed that the process with energy integration had a low global warming potential (GWP) of −2.624 kgCO2·kg-CaO−1. Conclusively, this work performed a systematic analysis of introducing biomass-derived H2 into CaCO3 calcination and demonstrated the positive role of reductive calcination using green H2 in mitigating CO2 emissions within the carbonate industry. © 2024 The Chemical Industry and Engineering Society of China, and Chemical Industry Press Co., Ltd"

It examines five broad domains: health hazards, exposures and impacts; adaptation, planning and resilience for health; mitigation actions and health co-benefits; economics and finance; and public and political engagement. In this, the sixth report of the MJA–Lancet Countdown, we track progress on an extensive suite of indicators across these five domains, accessing and presenting the latest data and further refining and developing our analyses. Our results highlight the health and economic costs of inaction on health and climate change. A series of major flood events across the four eastern states of Australia in 2022 was the main contributor to insured losses from climate-related catastrophes of $7.168 billion — the highest amount on record. The floods also directly caused 23 deaths and resulted in the displacement of tens of thousands of people. High red meat and processed meat consumption and insufficient consumption of fruit and vegetables accounted for about half of the 87 166 diet-related deaths in Australia in 2021. Correction of this imbalance would both save lives and reduce the heavy carbon footprint associated with meat production. We find signs of progress on health and climate change. Importantly, the Australian Government released Australia's first National Health and Climate Strategy, and the Government of Western Australia is preparing a Health Sector Adaptation Plan. We also find increasing action on, and engagement with, health and climate change at a community level, with the number of electric vehicle sales almost doubling in 2022 compared with 2021, and with a 65% increase in coverage of health and climate change in the media in 2022 compared with 2021. Overall, the urgency of substantial enhancements in Australia's mitigation and adaptation responses to the enormous health and climate change challenge cannot be overstated. Australia's energy system, and its health care sector, currently emit an unreasonable and unjust proportion of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. As the Lancet Countdown enters its second and most critical phase in the leadup to 2030, the depth and breadth of our assessment of health and climate change will be augmented to increasingly examine Australia in its regional context, and to better measure and track key issues in Australia such as mental health and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health and wellbeing. © 2024 The Authors.

However, due to the small space, human metabolic pollutant (such as CO2) is more likely to accumulate, and the air is not easily circulated. In this paper, a full-size experimental platform is set up with three types of ventilation modes to explore the exclusion efficiency of metabolic pollutants and the overall distribution of age of air under these ventilation modes. The conclusions showed that the mean values of metabolic pollutant exclusion rates for the different ventilation modalities varied very little across the spatial dimensions of the confined space but varied considerably in the area around the head. The double-side attached ventilation method was the most effective in removing human metabolic pollutants, especially in the head region (CN ≥ 0.92), while the single-wall attached ventilation method had the best air exchange efficiency (η ≥ 0.85). This suggests an inconsistent distribution of CO2 and age of air, which is contrary to general common sense. The conclusions of this paper can guide the design of ventilation for tiny sleeping spaces. © Tsinghua University Press 2024."

However, its use leads to high material consumption and environmental footprint together with time-consuming processes for placing steel reinforcement. To reduce time-consuming processes and carbon footprint, the replacement of ordinary steel reinforcement by structural macrofibers is envisioned as a suitable solution due to: (1) the acceptance of fiber reinforced concrete (FRC) for structural applications in various guidelines (as Annex L of FprEN 1992-1-1:2023, draft for future Eurocode 2) and (2) the fact that the amounts of fibers necessary to reach the required mechanical performance of the FRC for crack control are expected to be economically competitive. Additionally, within the spectra of types of macrofibers capable of efficiently reinforce concrete, macrosynthetic fibers (MSFs) were considered in this research due to their benefits in terms of durability performance and reduced environmental impact (potential to use cements with lower clinker content and reduced thickness of elements). Aiming at confirming both the constructability, casting procedure and structural performance of macrosynthetic fiber reinforced concrete (MSFRC) partition walls, these walls were constructed in a real building in Switzerland. In this article, the design process is presented as well as the associated MSFRC material and structural experimental programmes, conducted both in laboratory and on-site. In addition, several FEM-modeling considerations as well as quality control and construction aspects observed during the implementation process are raised. Finally, for reference purposes, a first approach to the economic and environmental impact (CO2eq-based) of such MSFRC walls is presented. © 2024 The Authors.

In this study, we evaluate the climate impacts of Mexico’s food consumption patterns by creating a high-resolution (262 sectors) Environmentally Extended Input-Output (EEIO) model called MXEEIO. We focus on the differences between food away from home (FAFH) and food at home (FAH) and compare Mexico’s results with those of the USA. The results show that the main components of food spending in Mexico were meat, baked products, and beverages, raising concerns about their potential negative health effects if consumed excessively. Mexico’s total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from food consumption were estimated at 149 million metric tons (MMT) in 2013, as opposed to 797 MMT for the USA. Meat and dairy products were the main contributors to Mexico’s food-related GHG emissions, accounting for 57% of total emissions. Mexico spent a much smaller proportion of food-related income on FAFH than the USA (13% vs. 52%), suggesting great potential for growth as Mexico’s per capita GDP continues to rise. Detailed contribution analysis shows that reducing Mexico’s food-related GHG emissions would benefit most from a transition to low-carbon cattle farming, but mitigation efforts in other sectors such as crop cultivation and electricity generation are also important. Overall, our study underscores the significance of food-related GHG emissions in Mexico, especially those from meat and dairy products, and the mitigation challenges these sectors face. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024."

Design: Life cycle assessment (LCA). Setting: Tertiary maternity units and home births in the UK and the Netherlands. Population: Birthing women. Methods: A cradle-to-grave LCA using openLCA software to model the carbon footprint of different modes of delivery in the UK and the Netherlands. Main Outcome Measures: ‘Carbon footprint’ (in kgCO2 equivalents [kgCO2e]). Results: Excluding analgesia, the carbon footprint of a caesarean birth in the UK was 31.21 kgCO2e, compared with 12.47 kgCO2e for vaginal birth in hospital and 7.63 kgCO2e at home. In the Netherlands the carbon footprint of a caesarean was higher (32.96 kgCO2e), but lower for vaginal birth in hospital and home (10.74 and 6.27 kgCO2e, respectively). Emissions associated with analgesia for vaginal birth ranged from 0.08 kgCO2e (with opioid analgesia) to 237.33 kgCO2e (nitrous oxide with oxygen). Differences in analgesia use resulted in a lower average carbon footprint for vaginal birth in the Netherlands than the UK (11.64 versus 193.26 kgCO2e). Conclusion: The carbon footprint of a caesarean is higher than for a vaginal birth if analgesia is excluded, but this is very sensitive to the analgesia used; use of nitrous oxide with oxygen multiplies the carbon footprint of vaginal birth 25-fold. Alternative methods of pain relief or nitrous oxide destruction systems would lead to a substantial improvement in carbon footprint. Although clinical need and maternal choice are paramount, protocols should consider the environmental impact of different choices. © 2024 The Authors.

Blood transfusions require complex, interlinked processes to collect, manufacture, and supply. Their contribution to healthcare emissions and avenues for mitigation is unknown. Study Design and Methods: We performed a life cycle assessment (LCA) for red blood cell (RBC) transfusions across England where 1.36 million units are transfused annually. We defined the process flow with seven categories: donation, transportation, manufacturing, testing, stockholding, hospital transfusion, and disposal. We used direct measurements, manufacturer data, bioengineering databases, and surveys to assess electrical power usage, embodied carbon in disposable materials and reagents, and direct emissions through transportation, refrigerant leakage, and disposal. Results: The central estimate of carbon footprint per unit of RBC transfused was 7.56 kg CO2 equivalent (CO2eq). The largest contribution was from transportation (2.8 kg CO2eq, 36% of total). The second largest was from hospital transfusion processes (1.9 kg CO2eq, 26%), driven mostly by refrigeration. The third largest was donation (1.3 kg CO2eq, 17%) due to the plastic blood packs. Total emissions from RBC transfusion are ~10.3 million kg CO2eq/year. Discussion: This is the first study to estimate GHG emissions attributable to RBC transfusion, quantifying the contributions of each stage of the process. Primary areas for mitigation may include electric vehicles for the blood service fleet, improving the energy efficiency of refrigeration, using renewable sources of electricity, changing the plastic of blood packs, and using methods of disposal other than incineration. © 2024 AABB."

The proposed method begins by developing and validating the model for the methanol synthesis involving the recycling of unreacted gas stream into the methanol reactor feed. The data generated using this model is used to develop a GRNN-based surrogate model to expedite the evaluation of fitness values for the optimization algorithm. The objective functions considered for simultaneous optimization are minimizing the total energy cost per unit of energy input (TEC), maximizing overall resource utilization (R), and minimizing CO2-gram equivalent emissions per unit of energy input (EPEI). Pareto optimal solutions are obtained for three bi-and one tri-objective optimization case studies using the GRNN-assisted multi-objective optimization (GRNNAMOO) method. The developed GRNNAMOO approach reduces the computational time from multiple days to a few seconds for all case study scenarios. For the tri-objective optimization case, the operating point selected using multi-criteria decision-making achieves 84.37% of R, 10.45 $/GJ of TEC, and an EPEI value of 81.34 gCO2eq/MJ. These results represent 7.05% higher R, 0.34 $/GJ lower TEC, and 0.82 gCO2eq/MJ lower EPEI than the Aspen plus simulation results. Further, the carbon footprint values obtained are significantly lower than 110 gCO2eq/MJ reported for modern methanol plants for nearly the same R and TEC values. The proposed approach aligns with the United Nations' sustainability development goals by lowering energy costs and promoting sustainable energy through improved environmental sustainability in methanol production plants. © 2024 Institution of Chemical Engineers"

Accordingly, in this study, a diet structure optimization model was developed to simulate the diet structure of urban and rural residents in four regions of China, taking into account nutritional needs and environmental sustainability for optimization. The results showed that by optimization based on nutrition alone, nutrient adequacy ratios could increase by 2.8% on average, narrowing regional disparities. Incorporating environmental sustainability slightly reduced nutritional improvements but significantly lowered carbon emissions, water usage, and ecological footprints by 2.9%, 6.9%, and 2.4%, respectively. By simulating the optimization of diet structure, the Qinghai-Tibet region showed potential for nutrient enhancement, whereas the southern and northern regions had opportunities for environmental impact mitigation.

The carbon footprint resulting from these operations threatens environmental sustainability while the increased energy costs have a direct impact on the profitability of cloud providers. Using renewable energy sources to satisfy the energy demands of datacenters has emerged as a viable approach to overcome the aforementioned issues. The problem of scheduling workflows across multi-cloud environments powered through a combination of brown and green energy sources includes multiple levels of complexities. First, the general case of workflow scheduling in a distributed system itself is NP-hard. The need to schedule workflows across geo-distributed cloud datacenters adds a further layer of complexity atop the general problem. The problem becomes further challenging when the datacenters are powered through renewable sources which are inherently intermittent in nature. Consequently, traditional workflow scheduling algorithms and single-agent reinforcement learning algorithms are incapable of efficiently meeting the decentralized and adaptive control required for addressing these challenges. To this end, we have leveraged the recent advancements in the paradigm of MARL (Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning) for designing and developing a multi-agent RL framework for optimizing the green energy utilization of workflow executions across multi-cloud environments. The results of extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the comparison algorithms with respect to minimizing energy consumption of workflow executions by 47% while also keeping the makespan of workflows in par with comparison algorithms. Furthermore, with the proposed optimizations, the multi-agent technique learnt 5 times faster than a generic multi-agent algorithm.  © 1990-2012 IEEE."

However, the absence of detailed and comparable studies has left the carbon footprint of DP steel and its sources largely unknown. This study addresses this gap by establishing a cradle-to-gate life cycle model for DP steel, encompassing on-site production, energy systems, and upstream processes. The analysis identifies and scrutinizes key factors influencing the carbon footprint, with a focus on upstream mining, transportation, and on-site production processes. The results indicate that the carbon footprint of DP steel is 2.721 kgCO2-eq/kgDP, with on-site processes contributing significantly at 88.1%. Sensitivity analysis is employed to assess the impact of changes in resource structure, on-site energy, CO2 emission factors, and byproduct recovery on the carbon footprint. Proposals for mitigating carbon emissions in DP steel production include enhancing process gas recovery, transitioning to cleaner energy sources, and reducing the hot metal-to-steel ratio. These findings offer valuable insights for steering steel production towards environmentally sustainable practices. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024."

Conversely, the uses of pest-control chemicals, long-distance transportation of salad mixes, and plastic packaging have raised environmental concerns among ""green consumers."" Because proenvironmental products are becoming more widespread, this study delved into market segments of salad mix consumers based on their preferences for proenvironmental labels. Data for this study were collected via a 2020 web-based survey of 2100 salad mix consumers in the United States. We performed a comprehensive two-stage cluster analysis that integrated both hierarchical and partitioning methods. This analysis was based on consumers' preferences and evaluations of production (low energy use, low fertilizer use, low greenhouse gas emissions, low water use, and pollinator-friendly) and marketing-related (biodegradable packaging, low carbon footprint, and low food miles) proenvironmental labels. Three segments were identified. We used ordered probit regression to assess the impact of consumer demographic characteristics, market preferences, and environmental perceptions on cluster membership. The deep-rooted segment, which represented 36% of the sample, highly valued all proenvironmental labels related to salad mixes and had a particular preference for labels that included low fertilizer use, pollinator-friendly production methods, and low greenhouse gas emissions. The indecisive segment comprised 40% of the sample and moderately valued all proenvironmental labels; this group mainly comprised individuals with lower income levels and those living in rural areas. The skeptic segment represented 23% of the sample and valued environmental labels less than the deep-rooted and indecisive segments did; additionally, they reported the lowest consumption of salad mixes. These findings can help retailers and policymakers communicate information about proenvironmental labels more effectively to each segment of salad mix consumers. © 2024 American Society for Horticultural Science.

Water can be purified wherever sunlight is available, providing a viable solution to water shortage. Metal chalcogenide-based materials are revolutionary for solar evaporators due to their excellent photothermal conversion efficiency, facile synthesis methods, stability, and low cost. Herein we present a prototype Bi-doped CoTe nano-solar evaporator embedded on leno weave cotton gauze (Bi/CoTe@CG) using the sonication process. The nano-solar evaporator was synthesized using a simple hydrothermal approach to provide an opportunity to scale up. The as designed solar evaporator consisting of 5 % Bi/CoTe@CG showed an excellent water flux of 2.38 kg m−2 h−1 upon one sun radiation (1 kW m−2), considered among the highest literature-reported values. The introduced solar evaporator showed excellent solar efficiency of 96.7 %, good stability, and reusability for five cycles of one hour. The best doping ratio of Bi in CoTe was obtained as Bi0.5Co9.5Te with a contact angle of 11.9° in powder form. The hydrophilic nature of the designed solar-evaporator increased the water interaction with the embedded nano-solar evaporator, which helps the transfer of the heat to nearby water molecules, break their hydrogen bonding and increase the evaporation rate. The ion concentration, of the desalinated pure water collected using Bi/CoTe@CG, decreased by many orders of magnitude and it is far below the limit of WHO standards for Na+ and K+. Thus, a self-floating Bi-doped CoTe nano-solar evaporator deposited on cotton gauze (CG) is an excellent solar evaporator for seawater desalination. The proposed solar evaporator is another step towards introducing environmentally friendly desalination methods. © 2023 Elsevier Inc."

However, industrial processes with heat demand vary significantly across industries in terms of temperature requirements, capacities, and equipment, making it challenging to determine applications for low-carbon technologies that are technically and economically feasible. In this analysis, we develop a framework for evaluating life cycle emissions, water use, and cost impacts of electric and clean hydrogen process heat technologies and apply it in several case studies for plastics and petrochemical manufacturing industries in the United States. Our results show that industrial heat pumps could reduce emissions by 12-17% in a typical poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) facility in certain locations currently, compared to conventional natural gas combustion, and that other electric technologies in PVC and ethylene production could reduce emissions by nearly 90% with a sufficiently decarbonized electric grid. Life cycle water use increases significantly in all low-carbon technology cases. The levelized cost of heat of viable low-carbon technologies ranges from 15 to 100% higher than conventional heating systems, primarily due to energy costs. We discuss results in the context of relevant policies that could be useful to manufacturing facilities and policymakers for aiding the transition to low-carbon process heat technologies. © 2024 The Authors.

In recent years, a big effort has been made to replace these solvents with more environmentally benign alternatives; however, this work has not had a significant effect on reducing the PMI and carbon footprint of SPPS. Herein, we demonstrate that by adding a low concentration of Oxyma Pure to the waste stream after Fmoc-removal, a simple real-time online UV-vis monitoring system can quantify piperidine with the needed sensitivity. In addition to the potential for reducing washing volumes after Fmoc-removal, this inexpensive and easy-to-implement process analytical tool allows the determination of completed washing by visual inspection due to the yellow color of Oxyma Pure in the presence of piperidine. Moreover, manual sampling of the waste stream is not needed, which reduces the overall process time.

Poverty eradication requires improvement in the living conditions of low-income households, which leads in turn to higher carbon footprints and may undermine the efforts of climate change mitigation. Previous studies have assessed the climate impacts of poverty eradication, but few have quantified how the additional carbon emissions of poverty eradication are shared at the subnational level in China and the impact on China's climate targets. We investigated the recent trend of carbon footprint inequality in China's provinces and estimated the climate burden of different poverty reduction schemes, measured by increased carbon emissions. The results indicate that poverty eradication will not impede the achievement of national climate targets, with an average annual household carbon footprint increase of 0.1%–1.2%. However, the carbon emissions growth in less developed provinces can be 4.0%, five times that in wealthy regions. Less developed regions suffer a greater climate burden because of poverty eradication, which may offset carbon reduction efforts. Therefore, interregional collaboration is needed to coordinate inequality reduction with investments in low-carbon trajectories in all provinces. © 2023 Science China Press"

Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) report CO2e emissions of past years on corporate level according to the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol and produce vehicle LCAs to identify GHG hotspots on the product-level. However, no approach to combine this past and future orientation of emissions modelling on fleet and product level yet exists. We demonstrate that this research gap is closed by using the “Decarbonisation Index” (DCI). Methods: We identify the missing elements of OEMs’ absolute emissions reporting and vehicle LCAs to develop a resource-efficient, dynamic and modular key performance indicator (KPI) addressing both past and future scope 1–3 GHG emissions of OEMs. We assess in how far other existing approaches such as the Organisational LCA (O-LCA), the Organisation Environmental Footprint (OEF) and modular LCA can be used to develop these missing elements in a holistic modelling approach. After the derivation of the DCI, we provide a list of modelling options and data sources showing that the DCI can serve different means of an OEM, from a rough estimate of emissions to a basis for a detailed decarbonisation steering model involving several brands and departments. Results and discussion: In the case study, we compute a 2015 and 2035 DCI (in t CO2e per vehicle) by using the basic DCI calculation model and publicly available data of the Volkswagen Group as well as data derived from publicly available scenarios. We demonstrate that even with this simplistic approach, the DCI delivers meaningful results indicating the core measures for an OEM’s decarbonisation programme: an electrified fleet with renewable energy sources being used throughout the supply chain and use phase. A Monte Carlo simulation of the 2015 results demonstrate the DCI’s robustness regarding the identification of core measures but also its dependency on changing (external or internal) methodological requirements. Conclusions: The DCI can be used by OEMs regardless of their company structure, powertrain portfolio or market coverage to monitor past emissions and model future emissions. The DCI combines the product-level of the vehicle LCA with the fleet-level necessary to develop a decarbonisation strategy. Its modular approach facilitates the use of generic LCA data or supplier-specific data on component level. Incrementally incorporating supplier-specific data is crucial to calculate the effect of real-world reduction measures in relation to generic databases used so far. An adaptation of the methodology to newly available data and regulations is thus possible and necessary. By adjusting past-reported DCI values to a new methodological set, an OEM’s decarbonisation progress can be analysed albeit the constantly developing methodology. © The Author(s) 2023."

We aimed to determine the impact of pediatric and young adult virtual medicine use on fossil fuel consumption, greenhouse gas, and nongreenhouse traffic-related air pollutant emissions. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of all virtual medicine patients at a single quaternary-care children's hospital with a geocoded address in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts prior to (March 16, 2019–March 15, 2020) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 16, 2020–March 15, 2021). Primary outcomes included patient travel distance, gasoline consumption, carbon dioxide and fine particulate matter emissions as well as savings in main hospital energy use. Results: There were 3,846 and 307,273 virtual visits performed with valid Massachusetts geocoded addresses prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. During 1 year of the pandemic, virtual medicine services resulted in a total reduction of 620,231 gallons of fossil fuel use and $1,620,002 avoided expenditure as well as 5,492.9 metric tons of carbon dioxide and 186.3 kg of fine particulate matter emitted. There were 3.1 million fewer kilowatt hours used by the hospital intrapandemic compared to the year prior. Accounting for equipment emissions, the combined intrapandemic emission reductions are equivalent to the electricity required by 1,234 homes for 1 year. Conclusions: Widespread pediatric institutional use of virtual medicine provided environmental benefits. The true potential of virtual medicine for decreasing the environmental footprint of health care lies in scaling this mode of care to patient groups across the state and nation when medically feasible. © 2024 Academic Pediatric Association"

In general, carbon emission factors play an important role in supply chain management because they measure the environmental impact of various activities and processes throughout the supply chain. By assessing emission factors, companies can identify the carbon footprint of their supply chain activities. This data aids in identifying areas for improvement, embracing greener methods, and minimizing global carbon emissions. However, measuring carbon emission factors can vary in complexity depending on the context, type of emission, and level of accuracy required. In this particular model, the vendor intends to produce the product in accordance with the carbon emission level and thereby incur the carbon emission tax. However, since carbon emissions from factories are not the same in all cases, the vendor is more likely to be penalized. Therefore, due to the uncertainty of the carbon emission-conversion factor, it is considered to be a triangular intuitionistic fuzzy number. Furthermore, defective products detected during the inspection are reworked and marketed; in addition, the variable production rate leads to environmentally flexible production. Also, to increase sales to the buyer, the demand rate is assumed to be price-dependent. Therefore, this research aims to maximize the integrated profit function of the proposed system using meta-heuristic optimization. Numerical experiments are carried out to evaluate the stated model, and result analysis is carried out to investigate the importance of optimized parameters.

Although suppliers' customers are increasingly signaling their commitment to tackling climate change through environmental disclosure, whether this signal contributes to supplier emissions reduction remains a question. Using signaling theory, this research proposes an emissions-reducing effect of customer base environmental disclosure on a supplier's GHG emissions level. Using a 2010–2017 panel dataset from multiple sources, we find empirical evidence supporting the upstream emissions-reducing effect of customer base environmental disclosure. Further, we identify two customer-base characteristics that affect this relationship: customer base climate innovation and competition. These findings contribute to the sustainable supply chain management literature by illustrating the effects of the customer base on supplier emissions performance. Specifically, customers could motivate a supplier's engagement in emissions reduction by collectively signaling their environmental commitment through enhanced disclosure. However, the effectiveness of this signaling effect can be contingent on the green innovation and competitive dynamics of the customer base. © 2023 The Authors.

Bioplastics have gained the attention as great alternative to unsustainable traditional plastics and to lower carbon footprint. However, the mechanical performance and wet stability of biomass are generally insufficient for practical applications. In this study, we present a simple approach for producing high-performance biodegradable plastic from lignocellulosic plant-based resources such as Musa paradisiaca Linn (banana), Hibiscus rosasinensis (hibiscus), Mangifera indica (mango) and Prunus dulcis (almond) using in situ lignin regeneration. In this approach, the homogenous cellulose-chitosan slurry is formed by the deconstruction of leaves collected from these plants. Cellulosic bioplastic materials were produced by hydrogen bonding among acetylated cellulose, carboxymethylated chitosan, and glycerol. In SEM images, the natural lignocellulose shows a honeycomb-like structure. Additionally, it exhibits high mechanical properties, with Chi-Hi containing higher percentages (52–59%) of cellulose in bast fiber, better water stability, and thermal stability. In contrast, Chi-Mos exhibits a higher 90° θ water contact angle. Furthermore, all fabricated bioplastics have synchronous melting temperatures of 257 ± 1.3 °C. Moreover, lignocellulosic bioplastic has a lower environmental impact due to its simple recycling or secure biodegradability, resulting in an average mass loss of 35.67% after 15 days.

The dosage of silica additives and APC residues ranges from 0 − 6 wt% and 0–15 wt%, respectively. The mechanical properties, reaction kinetics, phase composition, microstructure and carbonation resistance of the blended binder were investigated. Results indicated that SF slightly improved the early compressive strength with the formation of C-(A)-S-H gel (Ca/Si = 1.47, Al/Si = 0.23), hemicarboaluminate and hydrotalcite; reactive NS retarded the activation of GGBFS and inhibited the formation of hemicarboaluminate and hydrotalcite, while promoting the formation of C-A-S-H gel (Ca/Si = 1.01, Al/Si = 0.23), resulting in an impressive 80.3 % enhancement in compressive strength. Notably, NS-modified samples exhibited decreased carbonation resistance due to increased porosity and C-(A)-S-H gels that are vulnerable to carbonation. Conversely, 2 % SF addition decreased the diffusion rate of CO2, and APC residues improved the carbonation resistance by facilitating the formation of C-(A)-S-H gel with a higher Ca/Si ratio. This study provided an alternative management practice for APC residues with favorable early strength development and offered new insights into using silica additives to enhance waste-combined alkali-activated materials. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

This study conducts a detailed comparison of online AI and offline HTE approaches for chemical experimentation. Focusing on nanocrystal synthesis as an example application, online AI optimization is found to achieve superior performance and sustainability compared to conventional HTE methods that sweep larger experimental spaces. Specifically, for synthesizing NaYF4:Yb/Tm nanocrystals, offline HTE reaches better quality metrics, a good efficiency, and high carbon emissions, while online AI reaches similar quality and consumes far fewer raw materials with a better efficiency and low carbon emission.

Surgical wrap comprises 11% of operating theatre waste. Aims: The primary aim of this study was to pilot the implementation of a recycling initiative for surgical instrument set wrap in an operating theatre in Ireland. Secondary aims included quantification of the surgical wrap diverted from general waste to recycling streams over a 5-week period and estimation of the annual carbon emissions associated with gynaecology surgical wrap use in Cork. Methods: The amount of polypropylene surgical wrap generated by a single gynaecology theatre at Cork University Maternity Hospital was prospectively quantified from 24/1/22 to 1/3/22. At the end of the study period, individual sheets of polypropylene wrap were counted and dimensions were measured to calculate the total surface area of surgical wrap saved for recycling. Results: A total of 66 surgeries were performed over the 5-week study period. Two hundred twenty-one individual sheets of surgical wrap were collected, equating to 282.1 m2 of polypropylene wrap. An estimated 11,564 m2 of surgical wrap could be recycled annually from the gynaecology theatre service in Cork with an associated annual carbon emissions equivalent of at least 2.2 tonnes of CO2. Conclusion: Diversion of surgical wrap from general waste and clinical waste streams to the recycling stream is achievable in every operating theatre. Small changes to operating theatre waste disposal practices have the potential to yield significant reductions to theatre waste outputs and to hospital carbon emissions. © The Author(s) 2023."

More precisely, in the case of the footwear bonding process its environmental impact is mainly related to the VOCs emissions resulting from the use of organic solvents in the most common adhesives used, as well as during the application of some surface treatments such as halogenation. Moreover, the use of raw materials of fossil origin also contributes to its carbon footprint. The aim of this work is to deploy cleaner technologies to minimise the environmental footprint of the footwear bonding process through several approaches at different steps of the process life cycle, also to contribute to footwear circularity. This work focuses on the synthesis and application of reactive hot melt polyurethanes from CO2-based polyols as biobased adhesives, and the study of plasma-based surface treatments (low-pressure plasma and atmospheric pressure plasma) to improve adhesion properties, using styrene-butadiene vulcanised (SBR) rubber as a representative footwear soling material. The influence of CO2-based polyols on the polyurethane structure and the physicochemical effects of the plasma treatments on the rubber surface, as well as the final adhesion properties have been evaluated by means of different experimental techniques. The results showed that the values obtained for the T-peel strength of the adhesive joints studied, with the combination of the application of the plasma surface treatments and the biobased reactive hotmelt, exceed the minimum quality requirements for footwear according to the standardised tests. As a result, the deployment of such cleaner technologies regarding adhesives and surface treatments in the footwear bonding process will contribute to improving footwear carbon footprint and its circularity. © IMechE 2022."

Meeting sustainability targets will require transformative changes to how cities are constructed. Yet, accurate information on embodied building materials and their environmental impacts at the city scale is still lacking. We use Light Detection and Ranging data, building archetype information, and statistical models to estimate the embodied materials in buildings in Canberra, Australia, and their energy, carbon, and water footprint. In 2015, 57 million tonnes (Mt) of materials were embodied in 140,805 buildings. By weight, concrete was the most used material (44%), followed by sand and stone (32%), and ceramics (11%). Current population growth and building construction trends indicate a need for 2.4 times the building materials stock of 2015 by 2060. Producing such materials would require 1.6 thousand TJ of energy and 793 thousand megaliters of water and emit 48 Mt of CO2e—an environmental footprint 1.6 times the one in 2015. If the additional population were to live only in new single houses, material demand would be 4% higher than under current trends and the environmental footprint 5% higher. Housing new residents in low-rise apartments would reduce from current trends the material demand by 5% and the environmental footprint by 12%. Using only apartments of four or more stories would reduce material demand by 28% and the environmental footprint by 14%.

259,Integrated computational approaches for energy retrofit of historical buildings in extreme climate environments,Article,Stellacci S.; Domingos L.; Resende R.,International Journal of Building Pathology and Adaptation,42.0,2024,114,132,10.1108/IJBPA-03-2022-0044,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139937328&doi=10.1108%2fIJBPA-03-2022-0044&partnerID=40&md5=b614759704b84069e253f006a035291e,23984708,Scopus,Building energy retrofit; Climate change adaption; Historic built environment; Integrated computational tools; Parametric modelling tools,"Purpose: The purpose of this research is to test the effectiveness of integrating Grasshopper 3D and measuring attractiveness by a categorical based evaluation technique (M-MACBETH) for building energy simulation analysis within a virtual environment. Set of energy retrofitting solutions is evaluated against performance-based criteria (energy consumption, weight and carbon footprint), and considering the preservation of the cultural value of the building, its architectural and spatial configuration. Design/methodology/approach: This research addresses the building energy performance analysis before and after the design of retrofitting solutions in extreme climate environments (2030–2100). The proposed model integrates data obtained from an advanced parametric tool (Grasshopper) and a multi-criteria decision analysis (M-MACBETH) to score different energy retrofitting solutions against energy consumption, weight, carbon footprint and impact on architectural configuration. The proposed model is tested for predicting the performance of a traditional timber-framed dwelling in a historic parish in Lisbon. The performance of distinct solutions is compared in digitally simulated climate conditions (design scenarios) considering different criteria weights. Findings: This study shows the importance of conducting building energy simulation linking physical and digital environments and then, identifying a set of evaluation criteria in the analysed context. Architects, environmental engineers and urban planners should use computational environment in the development design phase to identify design solutions and compare their expected impact on the building configuration and performance-based behaviour. Research limitations/implications: The unavailability of local weather data (EnergyPlus Weather File (EPW) file), the high time-resource effort, and the number/type of the energy retrofit measures tested in this research limit the scope of this study. In energy simulation procedures, the baseline generally covers a period of thirty, ten or five years. In this research, due to the fact that weather data is unavailable in the format required in the simulation process (.EPW file), the input data in the baseline is the average climatic data from EnergyPlus (2022). Additionally, this workflow is time-consuming due to the low interoperability of the software. Grasshopper requires a high-skilled analyst to obtain accurate results. To calculate the values for the energy consumption, i.e. the values of energy per day of simulation, all the values given per hour are manually summed. The values of weight are obtained by calculating the amount of material required (whose dimensions are provided by Grasshopper), while the amount of carbon footprint is calculated per kg of material. Then this set of data is introduced into M-MACBETH. Another relevant limitation is related to the techniques proposed for retrofitting this case study, all based on wood-fibre boards. Practical implications: The proposed method for energy simulation and climate change adaptation can be applied to other historic buildings considering different evaluation criteria and context-based priorities. Social implications: Context-based adaptation measures of the built environment are necessary for the coming years due to the projected extreme temperature changes following the 2015 Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda. Built environments include historical sites that represent irreplaceable cultural legacies and factors of the community's identity to be preserved over time. Originality/value: This study shows the importance of conducting building energy simulation using physical and digital environments. Computational environment should be used during the development design phase by architects, engineers and urban planners to rank design solutions against a set of performance criteria and compare the expected impact on the building configuration and performance-based behaviour.

However, the cleaning and maintenance of high-speed rail is a comprehensive task, which may easily cause environmental pollution. This study aims to analyze and improve the sustainability of the formulation and production process of a concentrated complex enzyme detergent used as the maintenance agent for high-speed trains via the life cycle assessment (LCA) method. The eFootprint software system with built-in China, European and Swiss Ecoinvent databases was used to establish the LCA model with the system boundary being from cradle to gate. The LCA model showed that the production of 1 kg of concentrated detergent generates the global warming potential of 2.53 kg CO2 eq, and other environmental emissions including acidification potential of 0.01 kg SO2 eq, eutrophication potential of 3.76E-03 kg PO43−eq, inhalable inorganic matter of 3.17E-03 kg PM2.5 eq, ozone depletion potential of 5.3E-06 kg CFC-11 eq, photochemical ozone formation potential of 3.44E-03 kg NMVOC eq, primary energy demand of 3.17 MJ, abiotic depletion potential of 4.97E-6 kg antimony eq, and water use of 0.84 kg. LCA results are not strongly dependent to the assumptions of the research, and the uncertainties of LCA results are between 8 and 16%, which is mainly due to the regional differences in technology sources, the year of technical data collection, and the representativeness of technology collection companies. Carbon footprint analysis showed that the production processes of enzyme stabilizer (glycerol) and surfactants contributed the most, while changes in power consumption during production and transportation distance of raw materials had limited effect on total carbon emissions. Therefore, the formulation of the concentrated complex enzymatic detergent was improved based on the LCA results. The new formulations with less enzyme stabilizer showed similar detergency to the original formulation. The new formulations could reduce carbon emissions by 5,500–9,200 tons per year and save between $4.4 and $7.4 million in annual production of 10,000 tons. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023."

Here, we compiled a large experimental database and conducted a comprehensive life cycle assessment to estimate the impacts of scaling up rice-fish and rice-crayfish systems in China. We find that a large amount of protein can be produced from the coculture systems, equivalent to ∼20% of freshwater aquaculture and ∼70% of marine wild capture projected in 2030. Because of the ecological benefits created by the symbiotic relationships, cocultured fish and crayfish are estimated to be carbon-negative (−9.8 and −4.7 kg of CO2e per 100 g of protein, respectively). When promoted at scale to displace red meat, they can save up to ∼98 million tons of greenhouse gases and up to ∼13 million hectares of farmland, equivalent to ∼44% of China’s total rice acreage. These results suggest that rice-animal coculture systems can be an important source of blue foods and contribute to a sustainable dietary shift, while reducing the environmental footprints of rice production. To harvest these benefits, robust policy supports are required to guide the sustainable development of coculture systems and promote healthy and sustainable dietary change. © 2024 American Chemical Society."

This study introduces a novel assessment of solar-integrated ecotechnologies, focusing on the constructed wetland (CW) and microalgae-based systems, viz., high-rate algal pond (HRAP) and photobioreactor (PBR), for the treatment of winery wastewater. Utilizing Emergy analysis and life cycle assessment (LCA), we comprehensively compared these technologies in terms of environmental impact, resource recovery efficiency, and circular economy integration. Our Emergy analysis of the HRAP revealed a substantial reliance on renewable inputs (94%) and its lower nonrenewable resource consumption compared to the CW system. The Emergy sustainability index initially indicated a preference for the CW system (42.93 sej year-1; sej = solar emjoule), but deeper analysis showed greater sustainability in the HRAP (341 sej year-1) and PBR (118 sej year-1). LCA results further revealed that PBR systems had a significant land-use footprint, impacting other environmental indices such as photochemical ozone formation and freshwater eutrophication. Additionally, the HRAP and PBR demonstrated a marked reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (−24800 and −23700 kg of CO2-eq, respectively) compared to the CW system (320 kg of CO2-eq). Life cycle cost analysis underscored the economic viability of these systems, with Scenario 3 (PBR) emerging as the most economically sustainable, exhibiting the highest internal rate of return (IRR) at 21.11% and a positive net present value after 20 years. Conversely, Scenario 1 (CW system), with its significant initial investment of AU$741220, showed no IRR due to the absence of revenue generation. Importantly, our study introduces circularity index scores as a novel element, revealing that the HRAP and PBR effectively incorporate circularity measures across various impact categories. These measures had moderate impacts, as indicated by scores close to but not exceeding 0.10, whereas the CW system showed no significant improvement, highlighting the need for more robust circularity strategies. Overall, our integrated framework provides a holistic view of the environmental impact and economic aspects, emphasizing the potential of solar-integrated microalgal systems in promoting circular (bio)economy practices and sustainable environmental management in the viticulture sector. © 2024 American Chemical Society."

The present study aims to map the forest canopy height and aboveground biomass (AGB) by integrating Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) and Sentinel data using Random Forest (RF), a machine learning algorithm in a part of the Pauri Garhwal district of Uttarakhand, India. The vegetation types/land uses of the study area were mapped using Sentinel-2 data with an overall accuracy of 91% using the RF algorithm. GEDI was integrated with 16 texture and 2 backscatter variables derived from Sentinel-1 SAR data to map the height of the forest canopy. A combination of LiDAR and SAR variables was found to be efficient in predicting forest canopy height. The forest canopy height map was validated using field-measured canopy height values from outside the LiDAR footprints with an R2 of 0.81, an RMSE of 1.61 m, and a %RMSE of 8.20. The modelled canopy height was further used with Sentinel-2 data to estimate forest AGB in the study area. The forest AGB was mapped by integrating field-measured AGB with Sentinel-2 data-derived spectral and texture variables and modelled forest canopy height derived from GEDI and Sentinel-1 data, using the RF model. The combination of spectral, texture, and height variables was able to predict the spatial distribution of AGB with an R2 = 0.88, RMSE = 22.05 Mg ha−1, and %RMSE = 15.11%. The study highlighted that a synergistic approach involving multi-sensor data can effectively predict the forest canopy height and AGB.

A key finding is that the differences in hydrogen density, compressibility, viscosity and thermal properties, compared to the other gases, result in significantly less thermal perturbation at reservoir level. The risks of fault reactivation and wellbore fractures due to thermally-induced stress changes are significantly lower when storing hydrogen compared to results observed in CO2 scenarios. This implies that hydrogen injection and production has a much smaller geomechanical footprint, with benefits for operational safety. We also find that use of nitrogen cushion gas ensures efficient deliverability and phase separation in the reservoir. However, in this study, a large fraction of cushion gas was back-produced in each cycle, demonstrating the need for further studies of the surface processing requirements and economic implications. © 2024"

The Haber-Bosch process, the typical ammonia production technique, is energy-intensive and high carbon-emitting. Intense efforts have been devoted to searching for sustainable options for decarbonized ammonia generation. Wherein, the electrocatalytic nitrogen fixation route driven by renewable energy is extremely anticipated. Herein, the integrated concept for ammonia production powered by direct solar energy is outlined and proposed. Responding to the limited yield rate and reasonable Faraday efficiency in ammonia synthesis, non-precious Cu-electrocatalysts with porous carbon as substrates are fabricated and Ce is introduced as a modulator which could facilitate electron conduction and nitrogen trapping. By optimizing the proportion of metal sources, strongly synergistic metallic effect of Ce and Cu is structured, further enhancing nitrogen reduction performance of electrocatalysts and inhibiting hydrogen evolution reaction. A satisfactory NH3 yield rate of 30.60 ± 3.04 μg h-1 mgcat-1 is achieved at −0.3 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in 0.1 M KOH and the corresponding FE is about 8.20 ± 0.22%. The solar self-driven NH3 generation system presents a total yield of 104 μg mgcat-1 and a solar-to-ammonia efficiency of 1% at ∼1.2 V in daylight.

This work reports the upscaling of pine, chestnut, and oak wood residues into functional conductive carbon materials applied to the manufacturing of electrochemical sensors. Studies carried out by thermogravimetry, Raman spectroscopy, nitrogen adsorption, and electrochemical measurements revealed a clear correlation between the biomass structure and the electrochemical performance of the resulting carbon material structure. The electrochemical response of the produced carbons appeared to be negatively affected by the wood hemicellulose content but positively correlated with the content of cellulose and lignin. Of the three tested wood wastes, chestnut-derived carbon exhibits the best electrochemical performance, being thus selected as the feedstock to fabricate screen-printed electrochemical devices. Batches of 120 screen-printed devices were prepared from 20 mL of carbon ink obtained from 60 g of chestnut wood wastes. The analytical performance of the fabricated devices was thoroughly assessed in solutions containing representative redox species. Then, devices were applied to the detection of heavy metals by well-known anodic stripping voltammetric detection schemes based on the electrodeposition of Bi or Sb onto the electrode surface. Some real water samples were analyzed in the lab, and the values obtained with the screen-printed device sensors are in good agreement with the reference values, within the error limits. These results demonstrate the potential of applying wood residue-derived carbon materials for the manufacturing of electrochemical sensor devices, looking at reducing the carbon footprint of these widespread analytical tools. © 2024 The Authors.

RAS contains four to six times more asphalt binder than reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP), so it is very attractive from a virgin asphalt binder replacement cost-savings perspective, as well as from a sustainability perspective, since over 50% of the carbon footprint of asphalt mixtures comes from asphalt binder production. Using RAS in asphalt mixtures also prevents it from being landfilled. However, asphalt binder in RAS is significantly stiffer than paving-grade asphalt binder, which can lead to stiff asphalt mixtures with poor cracking resistance. Materials, mixture design, and processing and handling developments have helped improve the success of RAS asphalt mixture use. The performance history of RAS mixtures over the past 20 years has shown that with proper engineering and construction it is comparable to virgin asphalt mixtures. In the current study, observations from field visits to six agencies that regularly use RAS in asphalt mixtures were summarized, identifying positive practices and lessons learned. Different agencies had diverse goals when using RAS; those with rigorous specifications and policies obtained good performance from the mixture, especially when closely monitoring it over time. Field performance reviews of in-service pavements up to 9 years old encompassing RAS or RAS and RAP revealed that with appropriate policy, mixture design, and quality control, good performance was achieved. Limiting RAS dosage, ensuring adequate virgin binder in the mixtures and a sufficiently soft blended binder, along with RAS processing and handling, led to positive performance. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2023."
268,Wheat straw biochar as an additive in swine manure Composting: An in-depth analysis of mixed material particle characteristics and interface interactions,Article,He X.; Peng Z.; Zhu Y.; Chen Y.; Huang Y.; Xiong J.; Fang C.; Du S.; Wang L.; Zhou L.; Huang G.; Han L.,Waste Management,176.0,2024,41,51,10.1016/j.wasman.2024.01.017,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184837432&doi=10.1016%2fj.wasman.2024.01.017&partnerID=40&md5=9b83a5ab39c793484f47af4b6fba0d3c,0956053X,Scopus,Biochar; Composting; FTIRM; Microscale characterization; Particle-size distribution,"In recent research, biochar has been proven to reduce the greenhouse gases and promote organic matter during the composting. However, gas degradation may be related to the microstructure of compost. To investigate the mechanism of biochar additive, composting was performed using swine manure, wheat straw and biochar and representative solid compost samples were analyzed to characterize the mixed biochar and compost particles. We focused on the microscale, such as the particle size distributions, surface morphologies, aerobic layer thicknesses and the functional groups. The biochar and compost particle agglomerations gradually became weaker and the predominant particle size in the experiment group was < 200 μm. The aerobic layer thickness (Lp) was determined by infrared spectroscopy using the wavenumbers 2856 and 1568 cm−1, which was 0–50 μm increased as composting proceeded in both groups. The biochar increased Lp and facilitated oxygen penetrating the compost particle cores. Besides, in the biochar-swine manure particle interface, the aliphatic compound in the organic components degraded and the content of aromaticity increased with the composting process, which was indicated by the absorption intensity at 2856 cm−1 decreasing trend and the absorption intensity at 1568 cm−1 increasing trend. In summary, biochar performed well in the microscale of compost pile. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Design: Descriptive study. Setting: National Health Service (NHS), United Kingdom (UK). Population or Sample: Patients aged 25–64 years eligible for cervical screening in the UK. Methods: A carbon footprint analysis was undertaken for three cervical screening sampling approaches, from point of invitation to screening through to preparation for transport to the laboratory for HPV testing. A combination of primary and secondary data were used, with a bottom-up approach applied to collection of primary data. Main Outcome Measures: We report CO2e per sampling approach, which is the unit used to express carbon footprint and harmonise the contributions of greenhouse gases with different global warming potentials. Results: The total carbon footprint of routine cervical sampling is 3670 g CO2e. By comparison, vaginal self-sampling had a total carbon footprint of 423 g CO2e, and FV urine sampling 570 g CO2e. The largest share of emissions for routine sampling was attributable to the carbon footprint associated with an appointment in a primary care setting, which totalled 2768 g CO2e. Conclusions: Routine cervical sampling is up to 8.7-fold more carbon-intensive than self-sampling approaches with equivalent effectiveness. We found negligible differences in the carbon footprint of alternative self-sampling methods, supporting the need for an informed choice of screening options for participants, which includes sharing information on their environmental impacts. © 2023 The Authors.

Recent studies discussed how an industrial structure in which the primary industries are dominant is expected to have a higher carbon footprint than a structure where tertiary industries dominate. Also, the value creation of primary industries is less energy efficient than the tertiary level, and higher levels of environmental damage are expected. The study examines the relationship among urbanization, financial development, economic growth, renewable energy consumption, industrial structure, and environmental degradation. We are using Feasible Generalized Least Squares (FGLS) and panel-corrected standard errors (PCSEs) models to estimate the correlation. The results support that growth policies should be shaped based on sustainable urban communities. As the economic output is based on a significant energy input, renewable sources should be considered for switching the energy mix from the classical one based on fossil sources to one with renewable sources predominance. © 2023 International Association for Gondwana Research"

It is produced mostly from natural gas in large scale plants using steam methane reforming, a very mature technology. Hydrogen produced from natural gas has a high carbon footprint, considering that about 6-9 tons of CO2 are co-produced (and emitted to the atmosphere) per ton of produced hydrogen, depending on natural gas composition. For this reason, hydrogen produced from fossil fuels is nowadays named as ""grey""hydrogen. The current production of hydrogen is responsible of about 2.5 of CO2 emissions worldwide. For hydrogen remaining in business, and then becoming a factor in the energy transition period and later, decarbonizing its production is a must. Partially decarbonized hydrogen produced from fossil fuels, through CO2 capture, is named ""blue""hydrogen. A completely different path is followed for the production of fully decarbonized, or ""green""hydrogen. This path is already commercially available, though on a smaller scale than required for wide industrial application. It is the electrolysis of water, i.e. the use of electric power from renewable sources to break the water molecule into its constituent hydrogen and oxygen. Pros & cons of these two options will be critically examined.  © 2023 IUPAC & De Gruyter."

Hepatitis C virus management has been revolutionised following the widespread availability of direct-acting antiviral agents in Australia since 2016; however, large proportions of the population remain untreated. Telehealth-based service delivery is an accessible and effective alternative, and we aimed to assess qualitative and clinical outcomes in a clinical nurse consultant-led regional telehealth model. Methods: A prospective cohort analysis of all patients referred to a Victorian regional hospital’s hepatitis C virus telehealth clinic between 1 April 2017 and 10 June 2020 was conducted. Data were collated from outpatient and electronic medical records. Results: Fifty-five out of 71 referred patients were booked, with 44 patients (80%) attending at least one appointment. A history of alcohol use disorder and psychiatric comorbidity was seen in 25 (54%) and 24 (52%) patients, respectively. Twenty-one out of 24 (88%) eligible patients had direct-acting antiviral agent treatment and 14 out of 21 (67%) successfully completed the treatment. An average of 46.5 km, 54.6 min and $AUD30.70 was saved per patient for each visit. Observed benefits included: increased medical engagement, adherence to and completion of HCV treatment and cirrhosis monitoring. Telehealth-driven hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance was successful in the cirrhotic subgroup. Conclusion: Clinical nurse consultant-led hepatitis C virus management via telehealth allows access to marginalised regional populations. Clinical outcomes were comparable to other cohorts with additional cost-benefit, efficiency gains and carbon footprint reduction amongst a previously unreported regional Victorian hepatitis C virus population. © The Author(s) 2021."

To overcome this issue, this study uncovers the effect of economic complexity, foreign direct investment, and renewable electricity on the load capacity factor (LCF). The panel nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) method is used to analyze BRICS-T countries for the period 1990–2018. The outcomes reveal that a positive shock in economic complexity has a long-run positive impact on the LCF, but is insignificant in the short-run. Similarly, a negative shock in economic complexity has only a short-run environmental-promoting effect. A negative shock in foreign direct investment improves the LCF in both the short-run and long-run, but a positive shock in foreign direct investment promotes environmental quality only in the long-run. Similarly, renewable electricity improves environmental quality in the both short-run and long-run. Both control variables (i.e., economic growth and fossil fuel consumption) have a negative impact on the LCF in the both short-run and long-run. Also, the findings are robust to advanced econometric methodologies. Based on empirical findings, relevant policy points for improving environmental quality and achieving sustainable development goals are proposed. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023."

Meanwhile, steel industry requires substantial amounts of ferrovanadium (FeV), that is produced by aluminothermic reduction, generating calcium aluminate (CA)-rich slags. The FeV slags that are generated contain MgO that is partially or fully incorporated into magnesium aluminate spinel structure. CA phases and MA are the main mineralogical phases in calcium magnesium aluminate (CMA) cements. This makes the FeV by-products suitable alternatives of CMA cement while promoting industrial symbiosis. CMA cement, unlike Portland cement, can be the exact type of cement that is dedicated in high-temperature applications such refractory lining of steel ladles. In this publication, industrial FeV slags were size reduced to match CMA particle size distribution and evaluated as substitutes of commercial CMA cement used for alumina-spinel castables. The refractoriness experiments and the mechanical tests proved that the novel cements are efficient substitutes of CMA. The hydration and also the mechanical behavior of FeV slag-bonded castables is as sufficient as the CMA-bonded castables.

This paper studies three important investor groups that can be instrumental in driving the transition and evaluates their Exit and Voice behavior. I find that the five largest asset managers perform poorly on Exit and Voice over the full sample period but improved on both in more recent years. Only a small fraction of signatories to sustainable investor initiatives are supportive of the transition. Counterintuitively, investors who perform poorly on Exit, perform well on Voice. Finally, I examine the financial consequences of employing Exit and Voice and find that Exit is positively related to risk-adjusted fund returns; however, this is not necessarily attributable to superior skill of fund managers. © The Author(s) 2024."

Utilizing multiple linear regression analysis on 302 valid samples from Texas, USA, the research identifies the significant impact of these factors on rental intention. Notably, the service level emerges as the most influential predictor while emphasizing the unique and less studied role of hedonic and personal characteristics as essential antecedents of rental intention. The findings, supplemented by a Monte Carlo simulation, reveal that these personal and motivational characteristics are pivotal in shaping rental intentions, accounting for approximately 47.2% of the variance in rental intention. The study contributes valuable insights into the EV rental market, offering theoretical implications for the EV literature and practical strategies for car rental enterprises to tap into consumer patterns effectively. © 2023 by the authors."

It comprehensively covers RAP in concrete, including mechanical properties, durability, test methods, mix design, performance, influencing factors, RAP content, processing, admixtures, curing, and environmental aspects. RAP concrete matches traditional concrete mechanically while increasing sustainability through waste reduction. Durability parameters, like permeability, freeze-thaw resistance, and chloride penetration, suggest long-term structural enhancement. Reliable testing methods and standards are vital for RAP in concrete assessment. The review explores RAP in mix design, considering content, gradation, and processing. Admixtures and additives optimize RAP concrete. Curing and environmental conditions influence RAP concrete performance. Gaps indicate a need for long-term studies, understanding mechanisms, specific environmental exploration, standardized testing, and economic assessment.

This study aimed to quantify the amount and type of waste produced during an arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) and an arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (RCR), calculate the carbon footprint and assess the cost of the waste disposal. Methods The amount of waste generated from ACLR and RCR procedures was calculated across a range of hospital sites. The waste was separated primarily into clean and contaminated, paper or plastic. Both carbon footprint and cost of disposal across the hospital sites was subsequently calculated. Results RCR generated 3.3–15.5kg of plastic waste and 0.9–2.3kg of paper waste. ACLR generated 2.4–9.6kg of plastic waste and 1.1–1.6kg of paper waste. The cost to process waste varies widely between hospital sites, waste disposal contractors and method of waste disposal. The annual burden of the included hospital sites for the arthroscopic procedures undertaken was 6.2 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Conclusions The data collected demonstrated a significant variability in waste production and cost for waste disposal between hospital sites. At a national level, consideration should be given to the procurement of appropriate products such that waste can be efficiently recycled or disposed of by environmentally sustainable methods. © 2024 Royal College of Surgeons of England.

The lightweight model considered various factors such as materials, geometry, and dimensions of the brake disc rotor and brake pads. On the other hand, the sustainable model considers the manufacturing process and aims to reduce the carbon footprint. To calculate the optimal lightweight structure, finite element analysis was conducted using two different materials to compare the resulting stresses and determine the most appropriate material. Subsequently, four different models were utilized in finite element analysis to evaluate the displacement and stress and establish the optimum structure. Regarding sustainability, two distinct processes were employed to assess the environmental impact and energy consumption to adopt an eco-friendly approach. This paper investigates the transition from the initial brake disc rotor to a lightweight model, employing finite element analysis, topology optimization, and sustainability considerations.

Among various biomass feedstocks, triglycerides from diverse sources, such as vegetable oils, animal fats, and microalgal oils, are particularly suitable for producing sustainable hydrocarbon fuels and chemicals due to their low oxygen contents and highly paraffinic backbone in the fatty acid units, the structures of which are already quite similar to those of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons. This implies that relatively simple catalytic conversions can effectively convert triglycerides into hydrocarbon products. In this Perspective, we will provide an overview on the hydroconversion of triglycerides into oxygen-free fuels, such as diesel and jet fuel, and value-added products such as lube base oil. In addition, we will discuss the important structural properties of the required catalysts and the effects of different fatty acid compositions of triglycerides for each conversion process in light of reaction mechanisms. © 2024 Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences."

The primary objective is to create low-cost, high-performance micro-VRSs (μVRS) that can measure the position, speed, and proximity of ferrous components. The sensitivity of the μVRS was optimized through theoretical analysis, aiming to achieve a minimum noise equivalent magnetic induction. The fabrication of the μVRS involved using a cost-effective single-mask lithography process to create a planar spiral inductor on a silicon wafer. Once the fabrication was complete, the μVRS was wire-bonded to a printed circuit board (PCB). The cylindrical magnet was then affixed to the backside of the PCB, resulting in a passive μVRS. The presented μVRS successfully measured the position and rotation speed of an iron gear around the shaft of a stepper motor with high accuracy. The high sensitivity of the μVRS enabled the generation of an output electrical signal of sufficient magnitude, which could be measured using an oscilloscope or a commercial analog-to-digital converter. The distinguishing feature of the presented μVRS is its complete passivity, as it operates without any power source, unlike semiconductor-based magnetic field sensors, such as Hall effect sensors, commonly used in position and speed sensors. The passive nature, robustness, low-temperature dependency, and small size of the presented μVRS make it particularly suitable for smart energy-efficient buildings and smart manufacturing to reduce carbon footprint in the era of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT).  © 2017 IEEE."
283,Easy-to-implement educational interventions to bring climate-smart actions to daily anesthesiologic practice: a cross-sectional before and after study,Article,Dölker T.; Schuler J.; Wallqvist J.; Rossaint R.; Kowark A.; Ziemann S.; Schneider F.; Baumann A.A.; Conway N.; Gruüßer L.,Minerva Anestesiologica,90.0,2024,126,134,10.23736/S0375-9393.23.17767-4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189169995&doi=10.23736%2fS0375-9393.23.17767-4&partnerID=40&md5=de69fad19652ab514754eb070d7808df,03759393,Scopus,Climate change; Ecological; environmental phenomena; General anesthesia,"BACKGROUND: Anesthesia contributes significantly to a hospital’s carbon footprint. Climate-smart actions have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Prerequisites for sustainable behavior of providers are knowledge and awareness. We aimed to assess the change in anesthesiologists’ climate-friendly behavior before and after educational interventions in three areas that every anesthesiologist can address in their daily clinical routine: 1) energy use; 2) recycling opportunities; 3) consumption of volatile anesthetics. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional before-and-after single center sub-study within the multicenter “Provider Education and Evaluation Project” at the Department of Anesthesiology, RWTH Aachen University hospital from May3 2021 to May 1 2022. Educational interventions consisted of stickers, posters and a presentation on climate-smart actions in anesthesiologists’ work routine between the first and the second assessment. For each cross-sectional assessment, all central 28 ORs were observed for one week. During the before-and-after comparison we analyzed: 1) energy wasted in unoccupied ORs because of running computers and turned-on lights at 9 p.m.; 2) feasibility of recycling preoperative anesthesia plastic packaging by determining the difference between calculated weight of unseparated preoperative plastic waste in the first assessment and the weight of actual separated waste in the second assessment; 3) fresh gas flow in balanced anesthesia cases in steady state at 9 a.m., and purchased hypnotics converted to bottles/1000 general anesthesia cases in 2018-2022. RESULTS: We observed a reduction of wasted energy by 44% in unoccupied ORs. Usage of low fresh gas flow settings increased from 55% to 75%. The average of purchased desflurane in 2018-2020 decreased by 72% in 2022. We calculated 10.33 kg of preoperative plastic waste per week but were unable to implement waste separation for infrastructural and logistical reasons. CONCLUSIONS: We found that environment-friendly working behaviors increased after the implementation of educational interventions. The causality between the interventions and the observed improvements remains to be proven. © 2023 THE AUTHORS."

However, it is important to raise public awareness of emission hotspots and the possibility of mitigation in dairy supply chains. This study assessed the Carbon Footprint (CF) of five dairy products through a cradle-to-grave Life Cycle Assessment approach and evaluated the carbon sink potential of some practices. The functional units were 1 kg of fresh raw milk, yogurt, fresh cheese, mozzarella cheese, and aged cheese. The data collected were related to an extensive dairy farm, a cheese-factory, two markets, a delivery service, and a court of consumers. The CFs were 4.39, 5.10, 9.82, 8.40, and 15.34 kg CO2 eq. for fresh raw milk, yogurt, mozzarella cheese, fresh cheese, and aged cheese, respectively. The hotspots of the dairy supply chain considered herein refer to farm activities and energy consumption, whereas conservative agriculture practices and rotational grazing sequestered 1.60 ± 0.80 kg CO2 eq. per kg of dairy product consumed. The CF was reduced by 0.14 kg CO2 eq. for 1 kg of dairy product delivered at home compared to direct purchasing at a market. The carbon sink capacity of dairy farms appeared as a primary mean for mitigating climate change in the dairy supply chain. © 2024 by the authors."

Addressing this crisis necessitates the immediate implementation of adaptive mitigation strategies, especially within the agricultural sector. In this context, this study aimed to assess how the supply of nitrogen (N) (0, 70, 140, and 210 kg N ha−1) in the forms of ammonium nitrate and urea affects the agronomic performance, food quality, greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), and carbon footprint of potato plants. The examined hypothesis was that by precisely calibrating N doses alongside appropriate sourcing, over-fertilization in potato cultivation can be mitigated. A decline in stomatal conductance and net photosynthetic rate disturbs physiological mechanisms, reflecting in biomass production. Application of 136 kg N ha−1 as urea showed a remarkable yield increase compared to other doses and sources. The highest nitrate content in potato tubers was achieved at 210 kg N ha−1 for both sources, not exceeding the limit (200 mg kg−1 of fresh mass) recommended for human consumption. The lowest carbon footprint was obtained when 70 kg N ha−1 was applied, around 41% and 26% lower than when 210 kg N ha−1 and 140 kg N ha−1 were applied, respectively. The results demonstrated that over-fertilization not only worsened the yield and tuber quality of potato plants, but also increased greenhouse gas emissions. This information is valuable for establishing an effective fertilization program for the potato crop and reducing carbon footprint. © 2024 by the authors."

The deteriorated quality of surface water has led to the over-exploitation of groundwater, resulting in the drying up of shallow wells and deepening of groundwater levels. The increasing demand for water and drilling cost for boreholes have generated a prior need for exploration, monitoring, and assessment of groundwater aquifers in water-scarce agriculture-intensive areas. Identifying suitable aquifers is important; however, the emissions associated with the extraction of water from these aquifers should not be overlooked as fuel-aided extraction is a significant source of carbon emissions. A geophysical investigation based on electrical resistivity imaging using the dipole–dipole configuration was conducted in the agricultural belt of Alwar district, Rajasthan to detect aquifer depth and its hydrogeological characteristics. Resistivity survey data indicate the presence of a shallow alluvial aquifer at a depth of 9 m. The resistivity of the aquifer ranges from 15 to 84 Ωm, indicating that the soil is saturated with water in its weathered layer with a thin clay layer surrounding the saturated water zones. The groundwater and surface water represent high chemical variability which depicts that groundwater has deep meteoric percolation and subsurface geology has played a key role in regulating the water quality. Further, it was observed that electric and diesel pumps contribute significantly to carbon footprint with the values ranging from 249 to 1476 kgC/ha-yr and 60 to 266 kgC/ha-yr, respectively. Solar pumps can be a sustainable option to meet the target toward decarbonization with no emissions involved. The study concludes that solar pumping of groundwater is an important intervention for decarbonisation in agriculture sector along with judicious management interventions, improved methods of irrigation, and sustainable use of groundwater to ensure water availability and environmental quality in the region. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei 2024."

Therefore, it is necessary to understand, select and assess the risks of these ESG criteria and evaluate how they can impact a product or investment decision. Thus, the main objective of this article is to analyze ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) indicators and their potential impacts in the framework of non-financial information. Current regulatory developments, such as the European Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), are pushing to make ESG indicators (within this triple perspective: social, environmental and governance risks) a key set of information to be used for reporters and users of information. This article will study in further detail the main implications these regulations will have in how corporations will reflect social and ecological footprint information in their external reporting. Since these ESG indicators could have relevant financial impacts on the financial drivers of a corporation, stakeholders will be concerned on how enterprises are dealing with these ESG risks. Therefore, this ESG data will increase transparency and would mean a better understanding on how companies and investors have a sustainability compromise to evolve to a neutral carbon economy. In order to understand a company’s commitment with these ESG criteria, stakeholders would have to assess different aspects of the information reported. In this sense, this article will focus on how credit rating agencies incorporate these risks in their assessments. Credit rating agencies are becoming important actors in the sustainability criteria, as they incorporate ESG risks in their assessments, transmitting the importance of these indicators to investors and to markets. This study will look into the different time horizons between financial profitability and sustainability indicators. Current tendency and huge demand of non-financial indicators do not have the same profoundness, framework and tradition as financial indicators. This could lead to a situation in which it would be necessary a period to adapt both worlds and make them join and connect together in a sense in which one need the other one. © The Author(s) 2024."

However, as a viscoelastic material, GLB materials exhibit creep, which is a significant characteristic that needs to be considered. To ensure the safety and serviceability of structures that utilize GLB, it is essential to accurately estimate the long-term performance of GLB composites under external forces. This paper reports on an experimental investigation into the creep characteristics of GLB under tensile and compressive loads. The experiments were conducted at various load levels for a period of 500 h under a controlled environmental condition. The Burgers model and the five-parameter model were used to characterize creep behavior and predict the long-term deformation by extrapolating beyond the experimental period. The long-term deformation of the GLB may be overestimated by the Burgers model due to its constant creep rate for the viscous component. In contrast, the five-parameter model introduces a modification factor that results in a nonlinear viscous component, allowing a more accurate fit and a reasonable deformation estimate. Highlights: Creep characteristics of GLB were studied under tensile and compressive loads. Burgers and five-parameter models were used to describe the creep behavior. Extrapolation of Burgers model overestimates the creep deformation of GLB. Five-parameter model provides reasonable deformation estimate for GLB. © 2023 Society of Plastics Engineers."

Therefore, this study utilizes data from 27 OECD countries from 1992 to 2020 to investigate the complex relationships among renewable energy consumption (RE), environmental regulations (ER), financial efficiency (FE), and trade-adjusted carbon emissions (CCE). Additionally, we examine the moderating role of FE in the relationship between RE and CCE. This study employs the method of moment quantile regression to demonstrate that an increase in RE and more strict ER substantially reduces CCE. Similarly, FE has a significant inverse effect on environmental degradation. Further, we observe that as RE increases, FE plays a crucial moderating role, reinforcing the inverse relationship with CCE.

The delineation of a master plan boundary, formally known as urban growth boundary (UGB) of Indian cities, is utterly flawed not only because of the arbitrariness with which UGBs are delineated but also because of the utter discounting of the tenets of the draft National Land Utilisation Policy, which specifies functions of land serving the needs of people, the environment and different sectors of the city’s economy. The indiscriminate urban sprawl has only resulted in the loss of high-quality agricultural land and open spaces besides disturbing the ecosystems. It is not tenable that land prices necessarily rise within the city owing to the UGB, as it is plausible to have comparable growth on both sides of the UGB if they have the same level of services at the same price. This article examines the debate around UGB and undertakes an empirical exercise to objectively delineate it for an Indian city through different urban footprints to prevent the arbitrary urban sprawl that is occurring.

EF has an average of 17.15 with a low standard deviation, suggesting proximity to the mean. CO2 exhibits higher variability, with a range from -3.330 to 11.691. Similar patterns are observed for BC, FDI, GDP, and population. Correlation analysis reveals relationships, with positive correlations between EF and CO2, EF and population, CO2 and population, and BC and EF. Negative correlations exist between EF and GDP and CO2 and GDP, suggesting potential trends in the associations between ecological impact, economic development, and population dynamics. The Kao Residual Cointegration Test indicates that the variables in the analysis may be stationary after differencing, a crucial condition for cointegration. The p-values associated with residual V and HAC V are both less than 0.05, providing statistical significance and evidence against the null hypothesis of no cointegration. The overall low p-value (0.0004) for the Kao test further supports the rejection of the null hypothesis, suggesting the presence of cointegration among the variables. For biocapacity (BC) and foreign direct investment (FDI), individual intercept and trend co-integration tests show significant evidence.  © 2024 The author."

Energy-efficient designs for ACMV systems in building applications are therefore needed. While designing an efficient ACMV system, consideration must be given to the growing concerns of enhanced thermal comfort and improved indoor air quality. The variable refrigerant flow (VRF) air-conditioning system is a widely adopted alternative to the existing building cooling systems due to the higher energy efficiency and individualized temperature control feature. However, it still suffers from shortcomings such as no outdoor air induction for ventilation and higher initial cost. Therefore, this paper reviewed the variable refrigerant flow and mechanical ventilation/air distribution systems, their integrated designs for non-residential buildings, performance evaluation and control optimization of the integrated systems, VRF systems’ faults detection and diagnosis, current application of the VRF systems, and associated challenges. Together with these all, some advanced buildings’ cooling techniques and improvements toward nearly/net-zero energy buildings are briefly discussed. Indoor thermal comfort models and criteria for different climates are also presented for an in-depth understanding of the VRF integrated mechanical ventilation designs. The literature survey shows that the supply air temperature and airflow rate are foremost in parameters that can be optimized in VRF integrated ventilation design as they greatly reduce the energy consumption. Further, policies on elevated indoor temperatures in air-conditioned buildings to mitigate their carbon footprint are strictly being implemented. Therefore, this review provides an insight to the researchers for further improvement in the integrated design and control optimization of the parameters involved. A paradigm shifts from the conventional compression-based electric-powered air conditioning systems to the renewable energy driven advanced air conditioning technologies which is also an emerging research area to be focused on achieving the target of nearly/net-zero energy buildings. © Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary 2024."

However, like the procedures in other medical disciplines, they are a source of environmental waste generation and energy consumption. Methods: We prospectively collected data on total waste generation, energy consumption, and the role of intraprocedural inventory audit of a single tertiary care academic endoscopy unit over a 2-month period (May–June 2022). Detailed data on items used were collected, including procedure type (esophagogastroduodenoscopy or colonoscopy), accessories, intravenous tubing, biopsy jars, linen, and personal protective equipment use. Data on endoscope reprocessing-related waste generation and energy use in the endoscopy unit (equipment, lights, and computers) were also collected. We used an endoscopy staff-guided auditing and review of the items used during procedures to determine potentially recyclable items going to landfill waste. The waste generated was stratified into biohazardous, nonbiohazardous, or potentially recyclable items. Results: A total of 450 consecutive procedures were analyzed for total waste management (generation and reprocessing) and energy consumption. The total waste generated during the study period was 1398.6 kg (61.6% directly going to landfill, 33.3% biohazard waste, and 5.1% sharps), averaging 3.03 kg/procedure. The average waste directly going to landfill was 219 kg per 100 procedures. The estimated total annual waste generation approximated the size of 2 football fields (1-foot-high layered waste). Endoscope reprocessing generated 194 gallons of liquid waste per day, averaging 13.85 gallons per procedure. Total energy consumption in the endoscopy unit was 277.1 kW·h energy per day; for every 100 procedures, amounting to 1200 miles of distance traveled by an average fuel efficiency car. The estimated carbon footprint for every 100 GI procedures was 1501 kg carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent (= 1680 lbs of coal burned), which would require 1.8 acres of forests to sequester. The recyclable waste audit and review demonstrated that 20% of total waste consisted of potentially recyclable items (8.6 kg/d) that could be avoided by appropriate waste segregation of these items. Conclusions: On average, every 100 GI endoscopy procedures (esophagogastroduodenoscopy/colonoscopy) are associated with 303 kg of solid waste and 1385 gallons of liquid waste generation, and 1980 kW·h energy consumption. Potentially recyclable materials account for 20% of the total waste. These data could serve as an actionable model for health systems to reduce total waste generation and decrease landfill waste and water waste toward environmentally sustainable endoscopy units. © 2024 AGA Institute"

However, reuse ranks as a preferred strategy over recycling because product reuse can reduce material usage compared to product recycling and keeps material value higher for a longer time. Such reusable plastic packaging requires, besides a more robust product design, an additional return system. It is crucial to minimize the impact of this product system and ensure that reusable plastic packaging is not only more circular, but also more environmentally friendly than its single-use alternative. For this purpose, understanding the factors contributing to its environmental impact is key. In this paper, a new design of reusable packaging for two kilogram rice is compared with a conventional fully-optimized single-use packaging using a prospective extended life cycle assessment, including a circularity (using material flow analysis and specific circularity indicators, among which the Material Circularity Index), environmental impact (using a life cycle assessment with 16 midpoint indicators) and packaging-related food losses and waste assessment (using the food-to-packaging ratios). On average, the reusable rice packaging could be reused five times, due to losses at the distribution, use, and reuse preparation phase. While the reusable packaging scores better on the circularity indicators (a Material Circularity Index of 91 %, compared with 39 % for single-use packaging), its global warming and fossil resource depletion impact are respectively two and three times higher, considering a functional unit of one kilogram cooked rice to be consumed. The reusability and return rate, providing the retention of reusable packaging at the reuse preparation and use phase, respectively, were identified as the most determinative parameters by the sensitivity analysis. If these parameters could be optimized to a value of 99.75 %, corresponding to a total of 16 uses, the climate change impact of reusable packaging would be lower than its conventional single-use counterpart. The high food-to-packaging ratios (more than 18 for all impact categories) point to the importance of reducing food waste. If the packaging design could reduce food losses in the product system with 0.2 %, the reusable packaged rice would have a lower water use and mineral and metal resource use impact compared to the single-use packaged rice, despite the higher environmental impact of the reusable packaging unit itself. Therefore, this should be prioritized when further optimizing the reusable packaging design. © 2024 Institution of Chemical Engineers"

Installation of solar rooftops and photovoltaic panels is getting a broader response, even in residential and commercial buildings. However, at the same time, it is of paramount importance to manage the appliances in these buildings according to the local energy generated from these renewable sources to obtain a better supply-demand ratio. We address this problem by proposing a coordinated scheduling approach for flexible devices and the optimal usage of heterogeneous energy sources to minimize the energy drawn from the main grid and thereby reduce electricity costs for the users. We present a mixed-integer linear programming formulation for the problem and solve it optimally using Gurobi optimizer. Moreover, we also propose a set of efficient heuristic algorithms that consider the predicted renewable energy and price information to obtain the solutions efficiently for a large dataset. The results obtained show that the proposed algorithms deviate within 2.28%-18.47% from the optimal solutions in various settings, depicting their capability to be implemented in a real-world system.  © 2007-2012 IEEE."

The key to overcoming this challenge is to assess how much greenhouse gases are being generated and the hotspots which guide decision-making process toward more sustainable options. This article established a carbon footprint calculation method for disperse dyes. First, the system boundary description and the functional unit were discussed. Second, the carbon footprint inventory analysis was determined. What’s more, the calculation method, allocation method and emission factors were proposed. It was intended to be practical and effective based on three typical disperse dyes in China. The results showed that the carbon footprints of Disperse Blue 79, Disperse Red 167, and Disperse Orange 61 corresponded to 8.28 t CO2 eq/t, 8.07 t CO2 eq/t, and 7.48 t CO2 eq/t, respectively. For the three disperse dyes, the carbon emissions of dispersing agent melamine-formaldehyde resin and liquid ammonia consumption were the dominant emission sources. The steam and electricity were the two major sources of carbon emissions caused by energy usage. The homogenization and the wastewater treatment process were the two largest emission emitters. The sensitivity analysis showed that the total product carbon footprint was mostly sensitive to dispersing agent melamine-formaldehyde resin changes, followed by steam, liquid ammonia, and electricity. The results show that disperse dye production have great potential for improvement. The reduction options for the emissions of the disperse dyes production can be concluded by the optimization of the production process and technology for dispersing agent melamine-formaldehyde resin, liquid ammonia, electricity, and steam. Through the calculation, the influencing factors for the carbon footprint can be analyzed and highlighted. The method provides a comprehensive understanding of environmental impacts with dyes, driving the adoption of sustainable dyeing practices. © The Author(s) 2023."

Biochar which is an organic material created by pyrolysis offers straightforward, affordable methods for treating wastewater and lowering carbon footprint by acting as a substrate in CWs. Batch mode biochar-amended subsurface flow (SSF) CWs planted with Eclipta alba (L) with a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 3 days were used for the treatment of rural domestic wastewater in the present investigation. Two control CWs, without plants (C1) and with plants (C2), and five different amendments of biochar 5% (B5), 10% (B10), 15% (B15), 20% (B20) and 25% (B25) in ratio with soil were set up to check the treatment efficiency of CWs. Removal efficiency (RE%) of the CWs for parameters namely chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), phosphate (PO42−), sulphate (SO42−), nitrate (NO3−) and total Kjeldhal nitrogen (TKN) was determined using standard methods. Removal efficiency of 93%, 91%, 74% and 77% was observed for BOD, COD, nitrate and sulphate, respectively, in the B25 amendment at HRT 72 h. The highest removal of TKN (67%) was also observed in the B25 amendment at HRT of 72 h. No stable trend for the removal of phosphates was found during the study, and maximum removal was observed at HRT 48 h; afterward, phosphate was slightly inclined with the increasing HRT. The findings of one-way ANOVA using Tukey’s test show significant variations (p < 0.05) in the removal efficiencies of pollutants after 72 h between two controls (C1 and C2) and various biochar amendments in CWs, indicating a significant role of the wetland plants and concentration of the biochar as substrate. Biochar shows a positive impact on the removal of organic pollutants and nitrates. Hence, biochar-amended CWs can be a sustainable way of treating rural domestic wastewater. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024."

However, the extent to which lifestyle change contributes to mitigation relative to technological change over time remains understudied. Here, we present a scenario model that incorporates extensive supply-side technological transformations while excluding lifestyle changes. By adapting a global supply-use table from EXIOBASE using elements from Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 1 and a mitigation pathway consistent with the 1.5°C target, we assess how household footprints evolve in 2030 and 2050 and the extent to which technological change alone can mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. We modeled footprints for 49 countries/regions, with a focus on the EU27. Our scenario results indicate that while technological change can substantially reduce emissions, the reductions are ultimately insufficient to achieve the 1.5°C target. Eight EXIOBASE regions, including three EU27 countries, are on a 1.5°C-consistent trajectory with just technological advancements in 2030. However, by 2050, no countries are projected to meet the 1.5°C-compatible target. The average EU27 overshoot for household footprints approaches 2.2 tCO2e/cap in 2030 and 3.1 tCO2e/cap in 2050. Global overshoots are more moderate at 0.3 tCO2e/cap in 2030 and 2.0 tCO2e/cap in 2050. Our results highlight the critical role of household lifestyle transformation in climate change mitigation. Future research can explore the diverse lifestyle change pathways necessary to align with the aspirational 1.5°C target outlined in the Paris Agreement. © 2024 The Authors"

Still, this solution prohibits public access, is price-sensitive, has high energy costs, and there are concerns about their effects on the physical stability and material lifetime. In this research, a smart solution is developed based on the selective capture of acetic acid produced by the cellulose acetate polymer. This innovative approach is based on Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) for acetic acid adsorption, specifically a highly selective porous iron(III) based MOF, MIL-100(Fe), which was synthesized using a green approach. The stability of MIL-100(Fe), under acetic acid exposure, was demonstrated by accelerated aging experiments, with no noticeable changes in crystallinity and/or porosity as deduced from powder X-ray diffraction analysis, infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, nitrogen porosimetry, and electron microscopy. Compatibility tests with the artefacts were performed to prove the safety of the MIL-100(Fe) to the artefacts. A field application in a demonstration prototype (smart box) was performed at Institut Valencià de Cultura. A recently developed hybrid model provided recommendations on the quantity of adsorbents to use in the smart box. Good agreement was observed between the model predictions and the in-field experimental results, which validated the model application. The model predicted that the new adsorbent (5% of the film's weight, replaced every 10 years, at 16°C or 22°C) extends the film's lifetime equivalently to cold storage (5°C). Finally, environmental impact assessment and life cycle analysis were performed to compare the two preservation approaches. The new approach based on this Fe-MOF yielded an average reduction of carbon footprint related to movie film preservation of about 50% considering the current European Union (EU) energy mix and about 40% considering the 2030 EU energy mix (where a transition towards renewable energy is expected). The proposed innovative technology represents a robust solution towards efficient and more sustainable film preservation while significantly contributing to moving toward climate transition objectives in the culture heritage sector. © 2023 The Authors"

By harnessing and employing waste heat, power plants possess the capability to modify and optimize their operation, making a substantial contribution toward sustainable power/energy generation. Therefore, this study proposes a novel and eco-friendly approach to utilizing the flue gas emitted by a natural gas power plant. In addition to recovering waste heat, this method involves harnessing the flue gas for methanol production. The proposed system consists of an organic Rankine cycle, and absorption chiller, heating provider units, an electrolyzer for hydrogen generation, and a methanol synthesis unit. The novel method is implemented through computer-aided simulation using the Aspen HYSYS software and is subjected to an extensive analysis encompassing energy, exergy, environmental, and economic viewpoints. The simulation results exhibit producing 2712 kg/h of methanol with a purity of 99.97 mol%, 395.67 kg/s of hot water, 378 kg/s of chilled water, and 12253.57 kW of power. In this process, the energy and exergy efficiencies are 94.35% and 31.74%, respectively. Parametric study results demonstrate that reducing the gas turbine pressure and increasing the working fluid temperature in the evaporator of the absorption chiller cycle leads to improved exergy efficiency.

However, as the sector expands, it becomes imperative to address and mitigate the carbon footprint of transport refrigeration systems. The carbon footprint of a refrigeration system comprises both direct emissions from refrigerant leakage and indirect emissions derived from energy consumption. In this study, dynamic numerical simulations are used to evaluate the annual performance of a conventional HFC (R134a) transport refrigeration unit and of a newly developed natural refrigerant (R744) one employed in a multi-drop delivery mission in urban environment. Additionally, a simplified life cycle approach is used to compare the carbon footprint of these cooling units across various stages of the system supply chain, including refrigerant production and recycling, unit manufacturing, operation and disposal. Results show that the R744 unit presents significantly higher COP for high ambient temperatures, while its performance is degraded for low ambient temperatures due to low duty cycle. On annual basis, the R744 unit COP is 27.5 % higher than the R134a one. However, the increased weight of the R744 unit results in significantly higher emissions associated with fuel consumption required to transport the unit weight, leading to slightly higher fuel related emissions (+9.3 %) for the R744 unit. Nevertheless, the high GWP of R134a contributes to substantial direct emissions due to refrigerant leakages, resulting in an overall 31.9 % reduction in the lifetime CO2 equivalent emissions for the R744 unit when considering the total emissions. © 2023"

While plastic waste is often combusted as fuel for energy production, other thermochemical processes such as gasification, combined with methanol synthesis, and methanol to olefins (MTO) or methanol-to-aromatics (MTA) technologies, may offer a better solution to reproduce plastic products from olefin and aromatic chemicals. To explore these possibilities, this study focused on ascertaining the economic feasibility and carbon footprint of a refinery's large scale conversion of waste plastic methanol (MeOH) into ethylene (ET) via MTO, its capture and conversion of on-site CO2 emissions for the production of benzene (plan A), the outsourcing of bio-benzene produced via the wood methanol-to-aromatics (MTA) process (plan B), and the conversion of benzene and ET into styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR). The material and energy inputs and outputs for these chemicals processes, were simulated in the bio-chemical engineering software SuperPro Designer (SPD). A Microsoft Excel Green SBR Refinery (MSE-Ref._Green-SBR) template tool file was designed and uploaded with the simulation's process flows, financial data, and global warming potential (GWP) factors in kg CO2eq. to complete the pre-scripted formulas for techno-economic analysis (TEA) and life cycle analysis (LCA). The results concluded that the SBR refinery could achieve maximum profitability if it allocates roughly 25.0 % of its plastic MeOH for SBR production, with the remainder sold as ET on the market, and converts a maximum of 25.0 % of its CO2 emissions for SBR production. However, profitability depends on a financial grant covering at least 60.0 % of the total fixed capital investment (TFCI) cost. Switching to plan B reduced the grant needed by 30.0 %. The SBR products in both plan A and plan B had a lower CO2eq. footprint compared to other examples sampled, with the SBR product in plan A offering a slightly better carbon neutrality at 0.38 kg CO2eq./kgSBR, than plan B at 0.39 kg CO2eq./kgSBR. While the waste plastic MeOH feedstock accounted for the highest operational cost and most of the plant's carbon emissions (41.1 %), with future technical developments the cost and carbon footprint of upcycling plastic MeOH into SBR could be improved, or with bio-MeOH. By granting the public free access to the resources, data, and tools (e.g., MSE-Ref._Green-SBR file) utilised, this study's objective is to provide a template and methodology for the reader to modify or update the data, assumptions, and calculations it contains for their own academic or professional purposes.

Cradle-to-grave (tofu production) and cradle-to-cradle (tofu production and waste recycling) approaches were compared. Environmental impact was assessed by determining the 12 impact categories. Environmental cost was determined using the eco-cost 2023 method, and environmental and economic impacts were examined with SimaPro software version 9.4. FINDINGS: Life cycle assessment analysis revealed eutrophication, carbon footprint, and freshwater ecotoxicity to be the categories with the most significant impact for each process. In particular, the eco-cost of the cradle-to-grave approach was 7.03 United States dollars, and that of the cradleto- cradle approach was 7.90 United States dollars. Life cycle cost analysis yielded a net value of 1.33 United States dollars for the cradle-to-grave process and 38.16 United States dollars for the cradle-to-cradle process. According to the life cycle cost analysis, the recycling scheme increased the overall cost of production. Meanwhile, the eco-efficiency analysis demonstrated an increase in the eco-efficiency of tofu production (cradle-to-grave) and the recycling system (cradle-to-cradle). Waste recycling can increase the eco-efficiency index from 0.18 to 5. CONCLUSION: Life cycle assessment identified eutrophication, carbon footprint, and ecotoxicity (freshwater) as the three major impact categories. Proper waste management in tofu production offers environmental benefits and significant profits, with the net value of the cradle-to-cradle process at 38.99 US dollars. The eco-efficiency values showed a substantial positive increase, and the waste processing scenarios were found to be sustainable and economically beneficial. These findings suggest new business opportunities through straightforward waste processing and affordable production costs. The scheme also reduces the environmental impact and increases the efficiency and profit of the overall tofu production system. © (2024), (GJESM Publication). All Rights Reserved."

In this context, the study examines the European Union Five (EU5) countries, considers ecological footprint (EF) as the proxy of the environment, uses ET as tax-based environmental measures by making both disaggregated (i.e., energy and transport) and aggregated level analysis, and performs novel nonlinear quantile-based approaches for the period from 1995/Q1 to 2021/Q4. The outcomes show that on EF (i) energy-related ET has only a declining effect at lower and middle quantiles in Germany and at lower quantiles in Italy, whereas it does not have a curbing effect in other countries; (ii) transport-related ET is not effective on EF in any country, which means that it does not have a curbing effect; (iii) total ET has a decreasing effect in only Germany; and (iv) the alternative method validates the robustness. Thus, the study demonstrates the changing effect of ET across countries, quantiles, and ET types in curbing EF. Hence, it can be suggested that Germany can go on relying further on energy-related ET practices to decrease EF, whereas there is a long way for the remaining EU5 countries as well as transport-related ET in curbing EF. © The Author(s) 2024."

The BRICS, containing five emerging economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), recently announced Iran, Egypt, Argentina, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE as six potential new members. This expansion offers promising prospects for advancing environmental sustainability through green finance, which can be an excellent tool. In this respect, this research examines how green finance affects the carbon footprint in BRICS+6 economies. Earlier studies used panel data techniques to probe the association between these variables but overlooked that certain countries still needed to possess such a link separately. Hence, this research adopts the Quantile-on-Quantile approach, which provides a holistic universal view and customized findings for each country.

To achieve this, phase change materials (PCMs) are being investigated for thermal energy storage due to their high latent heat of fusion. However, their limited applications arise from poor thermal conductivity. In addressing this issue, the research delves into the preparation and characterization of nano-PCMs. These materials, synthesized in a laboratory setting, exhibit enhanced thermal performance compared to pure PCMs, attributed to the incorporation of nanoparticles in the material composition. Therefore, in the study, three paraffins with different melting temperatures (10, 15 and 18 °C) are modified by incorporating titanium oxide at various concentrations (0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 mass%). Thermal conductivity and latent heat capacity measurements were undertaken using a thermal conductivity measuring apparatus and differential scanning calorimetry, respectively. The aim was to evaluate the enhanced performance of the modified PCMs in comparison with pure PCMs and to assess their suitability for cold climate regions. Results showed that nanoparticle incorporation increased thermal conductivity by up to 37%, albeit with a slight reduction in latent heat capacity of up to 12%. Among the samples, RT18 exhibited the most significant improvement in thermal conductivity, while RT10 experienced a minor decrease in enthalpy values. Ultimately, RT10 was identified as the optimal PCM option for cold climates, as its phase change temperature range aligns with the outdoor temperatures in the Arctic. © The Author(s) 2024."

However, the comprehensive evaluation of different organic amendment applications in single-season rice agroecosystem on soil organic carbon (SOC), greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the carbon footprint (CF) have been inadequately recorded. We conducted a one-year field experiment, comparing chemical fertilizer (control) with straw, biochar, and manure application with equivalent carbon input (1200 kg ha−1), and evaluated their soil crop environmental benefits. Our findings revealed that three organic amendments significantly increased SOC storage, leading to enhanced yields. Among them, manure incorporation resulted in the highest SOC storage and yields, increasing by 13.68% and 26.08%, respectively. However, manure incorporation also caused significant increases in global warming potential (GWP) by 44.58%, mainly due to enhanced methane emissions. Despite having lower temporary storage of C, the CF of biochar (-3.96 ± 0.22 t CO2-eq ha−1) was similar to manure incorporation due to its GHG emission mitigation. When evaluating the comprehensive benefits on crop-soil-environment by Z-score standardization method, biochar incorporation demonstrated the highest positive effects on the rice agroecosystem, followed by the manure incorporation. Straw application should be avoided due to its high C/N ratio, which limits its benefits in terms of crop growth and GHG emission mitigation. Our results indicated biochar incorporation increased SOC storage, yield, and significantly reduced GHG emissions, leading to a substantial decrease in GWP and CF. Biochar emerges as a key strategy for achieving a balance between productivity, soil quality, and environmental sustainability in single-season rice agroecosystem. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Sociedad Chilena de la Ciencia del Suelo 2024."

Sustainability is an increasingly important issue in the construction industry. The desire for greater sustainability is often pitted against the demand for high quality. After all, the quality of building products not only affects our daily well-being, but quality in construction primarily stands for safety, load-bearing capacity and serviceability of building components – as all involved in construction are inevitably taught during their training. There is often a preconception that sustainability and the demand for high quality are at odds with each other. The aim of this paper is to address the issue of sustainability in geotechnical anchoring systems and to identify and evaluate the factors influencing the carbon footprint. Using soil nailing as an example, it is shown that steel and its production, as well as cement, play a crucial role. By choosing the right soil nailing system, the user has a significant influence on the quality and sustainability of geotechnical anchoring systems. In addition, the paper will show how optimisation potential can be exploited in practice. Last but not least, a practical construction project will illustrate the amount of CO2 that can be saved by choosing the ideal anchoring system. © 2024 Ernst & Sohn GmbH."

This attempt has become a situation that needs to be overpowered much sooner by the European countries, which have encountered challenges in many ways, especially regarding natural resources, energy supply, and the climate crisis. In this vein, the current study follows the novel, robust Method of Moment Quantile-Regression (MM-QR), which successfully yields heterogeneous information structure across quantiles, to examine the determinants of GTI for 15 EU countries over the period of 2003–2018. MM-QR estimation results indicate that the determinants of green technology innovation are heterogeneous across the EU countries. While green growth (GG) has an adverse impact on GTI in middle- and high-GTI countries, the effect of ecological footprint on GTI is positive for countries in the highest-GTI countries. The positive effects of financial development (FD) on GTI are revealed for all countries. Remarkably, environmental taxes have an adverse and positive influence on GTI in the lowest and highest quantile countries, respectively. Finally, renewable energy and greenfield FDI have no effect on GTI. Governments can promote GTI by providing financial resources, in the most immaculate way, to firms that engage in green technology projects, as well as by encouraging these through environmental taxes. © The Author(s) 2024."

The stated choice experiment, used for evaluation, was designed combining a set of alternatives, characterised by carbon footprint reduction and offset policies, taking into account the existence of environmental direct benefits, but also indirect benefits that improve tourist experience or co-benefits derived from the location of policy projects. Economic welfare in form of willingness to pay (WTP) was estimated, and the alternatives were compared using compensating variation values. The study's findings validate the prevailing preference for carbon reduction policies over offsetting measures, except when the first don't have co-benefits and the latter are implemented locally. In the latter case, there is no significant difference in WTP between reducing the carbon footprint and locally offsetting it.

Aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, this study incorporates four essential types of footprints associated with food consumption: land, water, CO2 and CH4 footprints, with particular emphasis on the often-overlooked CH4 footprint, whose warming impact is 25 times greater than that of CO2. Employing the structural decomposition analysis method, we find that, the dietary structure had the most contribution in reducing environmental footprints than those of population size, urbanization rate, and per capita food consumption volume in China after 2018. To assess the environmental impacts of different dietary structures, we set three scenarios: the current dietary structure S0, a developing dietary structure S1, and an optimal dietary structure S2 designed through an optimal model based on the dietary guidelines for Chinese residents (DGCR) 2022. We measure the environmental footprints resulting from residents' dietary structure across the three scenarios for the years 2025 and 2030. The optimal dietary structure in S2, which aligns closely with DGCR 2022, features meat and poultry consumption at 3.59 % and 3.26 % of per capita food consumption volume in 2025 and 2030, cereal and tubers at 20.48 % and 21.20 % and milk and dairy products at 24.47 % and 24.40 % in 2025 and 2030. Comparatively, S2 demonstrates significant reductions in environmental footprints when compared to S0. Specifically, the land, water, CO2 and CH4 footprints caused by residents' food consumption in S2 would drop by 10.50 %, 19.01 %, 14.32 %, 14.32 % respectively in 2025, and by 11.14 %, 19.85 %, 15.27 %, 15.27 % in 2030, respectively. Importantly, the reduced environmental footprints achieved in S2 are >1.8 times greater than those in S1. The findings highlight the potential of the dietary structure in S2 to improve residents' health while concurrently reducing environmental footprints. These results offer a basis for designing effective policies that guide both urban and rural Chinese residents towards healthier and environmentally sustainable dietary choices. © 2023 Institution of Chemical Engineers"

As economies grow, a global dietary transition is underway. Assessing the sustainability of diets and identifying potential risks of global diets in relation to economic growth are prerequisites for countries to implement targeted dietary interventions. However, existing studies assessing dietary sustainability focus primarily on present performance, not considering the potential future transitions in dietary patterns triggered by economic growth. We propose a two-dimensional “status quo-income elasticity” assessment framework to identify potential risks to diet-related human and environmental health in different countries as their economies expand. Our evaluation of diet sustainability in 141 countries encompasses three aspects: nutritional intake, disease risk, and environmental impact. We first assessed the nutrient supply and diet-related disease risk in each country based on their food consumptions. We then employed an Environmental Extended Multi-Regional Input-Output model to account for the environmental impacts. Additionally, an econometric model was constructed to gauge the income elasticity of each indicator to reflect the marginal change associated with economic growth. We found that some high-income countries with declining intakes of quality nutrients such as vitamins and minerals may face potential risks of inadequate intakes in the future. However, the future appears relatively optimistic. Although high-income countries currently have a high dietary environmental footprint, their diet-related environmental pressures (particularly carbon emissions and air pollution) will be somewhat mitigated with economic growth due to their substantial negative elasticity. Our assessment results can assist countries in designing tailored dietary interventions from an economic development perspective to promote economic growth, improve human health, and enhance environmental sustainability synergistically. © 2024"

However, the interpretation of LCA results, in particular when the objective was to compare different production systems, could be affected by the selection of the functional unit (FU). That is why an accurate definition of the FU, in agreement with the function considered for the systems analysed, is essential. In this work, the organic production at small scale of blueberry, raspberry, blackberry and cape gooseberry in North Spain has been analysed following LCA methodology. Although a different distribution of environmental loads was obtained for each crop, in all cases, the main contributions to most of the considered environmental categories were electric and fertiliser consumptions. The different production systems have been compared on the basis of the environmental impacts associated considering different FUs, i.e. based on fruit mass, cultivated area, farm-gate price and nutritional quality of fruits. Carbon footprints (CF) have been also calculated. It was observed that the order of the crops with respect to their environmental performances was the same for the blueberry and raspberry crops (with the lowest and the highest CF, respectively), independently of the selected FU, whereas the order of the blackberry and cape gooseberry crops was interchanged, depending on the FU used. This work supports the need of being aware of the final objective of the orchards when choosing the FU (i.e. producing fruits, cultivating an area, economic benefits or nourishing people), so that valid conclusions can be achieved from the environmental comparison, even for different agricultural products. © The Author(s) 2024."

However, its hygroscopic nature poses significant challenges, including dimensional fluctuations in response to humidity shifts. Here we investigate a new treatment method mitigating swelling and shrinkage using dairy by-product named whey ultrafiltration permeate (mainly composed of lactose) and citric acid. Trembling aspen and black spruce samples were impregnated with ultrafiltration permeate and citric acid. Infrared and Raman spectroscopy were used to evaluate the esterification reaction and the location of the impregnates. We found increased ester bonds in the cell walls and the middle lamella (leaving the lumens empty), explaining the improved wood stability. Trembling aspen was more receptive to the treatment than black spruce, as shown by a higher weight gain (39 % vs. 13 %) and anti-swelling efficiency (54 % vs. 37 %). No leaching was observed during characterization of the treated wood. The modulus of elasticity and rupture, and the Brinell hardness were only slightly affected for both wood species. Upon combustion, esterified wood samples degraded at a lower temperature, but the stability of the residues was increased. This study highlights a promising use of ultrafiltration permeate in wood esterification. © 2024 The Authors"

Supporting the identification of strategies that best minimise these impacts on people, planet and profit, this paper explores the dynamic impacts of food waste management options on the triple bottom lines of sustainable development in urban circular economies. We present a system dynamics model of the urban agri-food supply chain. This model simulates the fluxes of food and food waste throughout the supply chain, as well as their impacts on economy (i.e., costs and benefits for each sector and the broader economy), society (i.e., food insecurity) and environment (i.e., water, energy, and carbon footprints). Using Bristol city in the United Kingdom as a case-study, we evaluate the impacts of seven food waste management options (i.e., reduction, redistribution, animal feed, anaerobic digestion, composting, incineration, and landfilling). The results show that food waste reduction in consumer sectors (i.e., households and hospitality and food services) and redistribution in supply sectors (i.e., primary production and manufacture) offer the greatest benefits for the environment, society, and economy. For the retail sector, both reduction and redistribution options are highly favourable. Although these options can potentially have some adverse economic effects on the supply side due to a reduction in demand, their considerably high benefits make them high-reward, low-risk options. We thus conclude that food waste reduction and redistribution are the only options with a clear triple-win for people, planet and profit. This paper makes a significant contribution by introducing a robust quantitative model and a novel triple bottom line framework for sustainable food waste management in urban circular economies. © 2024 The Author(s)"

Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), being a major cereal grain crop of north-western India, has been highly energy intensive with large emissions of greenhouse gases, affecting ecosystems’ sustainability. We therefore, performed energy optimization in wheat for enhanced ecosystems’ resilience and carbon (C) sustainability, while predicting yields of 120 intensive wheat production systems across north-western India. An integrated approach of data envelopment analysis (DEA) and machine learning (ML) models was applied for energy optimization and accurate yield prediction. After optimization of energy input in wheat production, 8 different ML models of variable complexity viz. linear regression (LR), ridge regression (RR), lasso regression (LAR), elastic net regression (ENR), decision tree regression (DT), random forest regression (RF), gradient boosting regression (GB) and support vector regression (SVR) were applied and evaluated statistically for accurate prediction of wheat yields of studied decision making units (DMUs). These results revealed that wheat ecosystems have a high total input energy (EI) of 24.7 GJ ha−1, which comprises ~46.5% share of direct and 53.5% of indirect energy sources. The non-renewable energy input was ~3.9 times higher than the renewable energy. The total C equivalent emissions of 1815.7 kg CO2e ha−1 comprised the highest share of chemical fertilizers (~49.8%), and exhibited a linear significant relationship with EI (R2 = 0.8117**; p < 0.01). Nitrogenous fertilizers application contributes ~90.1% towards total fertilizer related energy input in wheat production. The net global warming potential of 2.30 Mg CO2e ha−1 yr−1 was estimated which resulted in yield scaled emissions (i.e., greenhouse gases intensity) of 0.34 kg CO2e kg−1 wheat grain yield. The DEA-based benchmarking showed that the technical efficiency (TE) score of 79 DMUs was < 1.00, elucidated ~65% DMUs as energy inefficient. The average (n = 120) TE score of 0.92 illustrates energy saving possibility of 2464.6 MJ ha−1 (~8% of EI), mostly via efficient fertilizer (54.4%) and irrigation water management (11.6%). The 1:1 (x = y) correspondence analysis implies that DT, GB, and RF models can accurately predict wheat productivity with significantly higher R2 values of 0.998** (p < 0.01), 0.950** (p < 0.01), and 0.832* (p < 0.05), respectively. These results underpin overwhelming significance of DEA-based energy optimization for wheat ecosystems, which helps reduce the energy and C footprints for sustainable and cleaner production. Nonetheless, DT, GB, and RF models outperformed in yield prediction with the lowest root mean square error and normalized mean square error, but the highest Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency and index of agreement. Therefore, DEA-based benchmarking has significant energy saving potential, while DT, GB, and RF models have highly accurate wheat yield prediction abilities for north-western India. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Sociedad Chilena de la Ciencia del Suelo 2024."
323,Prefab Light Clay-Timber Elements for Net Zero Whole-Life Carbon Buildings,Article,Päätalo J.; Alao P.F.; Rohumaa A.; Kers J.; Liblik J.; Lylykangas K.,Journal of Sustainable Architecture and Civil Engineering,34.0,2024,89,100,10.5755/j01.sace.34.1.35561,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186882338&doi=10.5755%2fj01.sace.34.1.35561&partnerID=40&md5=5d40c04e434c7151c857104ba4b6a2c4,20299990,Scopus,carbon footprint; carbon handprint; clay structure; prefabrication; timber structure,"“Net zero whole life carbon” is an ambitious climate target that refers to neutralizing and offsetting the entire LCA-based carbon footprint of a building, including both operational and embodied greenhouse gas emissions. Especially in the Northern climate, viable building envelope structures must, therefore, provide good thermal insulation and low embodied emissions. Carbon offset is typically based on excess on-site renewable energy or purchased carbon offsets disconnected from the building and the site. Viable strategies for carbon neutrality start by minimizing material-related and energy-related CO2e emissions. As a result, new kinds of building envelope structures have been recently introduced in the academic literature and experimental building projects. Traditional construction materials, such as timber and clay, have been sourced locally and processed manually, providing good results for the embodied emissions in life cycle assessment. Recent studies on clay-based construction materials have concluded that more research on clay as a construction material is needed, in particular considering its environmental performance. One specific concern in the Northern climate is that the weather conditions limit clay construction outdoors and prevent industrial-scale application of these solutions. The methods of prefabrication can address these issues. This study introduces the critical technical and environmental properties of a new prefabricated wall element based on a combination of light timber frame and light clay. In a hybrid light clay-timber structure, a mixture of clay and hemp shives is cast between the timber studs. On the one hand, the novelty of this wall structure is the prefabrication that enables industrial applications and upscaling without the limitations of weather conditions. On the other hand, the study assesses the climate impact of a light clay-timber wall element : cradle-to-gate emissions, thermal insulation, and the climate benefits outside the system boundary (carbon handprint) reported in the D-module of the LCA framework. The study also shows that natural materials require a different approach than synthetic materials from industrial processes. There may be variations in the properties of hemp and clay, especially when local sourcing is prioritized for better environmental performance. Moreover, the mixing and installation processes have a significant impact on the final properties and the performance. We show that constructing a light clay wall is a knowledge-intensive process that may result in very different technical properties. The authors argue that the case study demonstrates a paradigm shift in developing building envelope solutions. The future low-carbon building solutions are knowledge-intensive but prioritize local, natural materials and minimize the processing of these materials. The quality control could be based on the grading of natural raw materials, similar to the grading of sawn timber. In light of the results, we discuss the interpretation of the net zero targets and the viability of accounting for the benefits beyond the system boundary, reported in the LCA framework as module D impacts (also referred to as “carbon handprint”) as a carbon offset. The best specimen of prefabricated light clay-timber elements shows low carbon footprint and good thermal insulation while providing a superb carbon handprint. © 2024, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

324,Acceptance of Low-Carbon School Meals with and without Information—A Controlled Intervention Study,Article,André E.; Eustachio Colombo P.; Schäfer Elinder L.; Larsson J.; Hunsberger M.,Journal of Consumer Policy,47.0,2024,109,125,10.1007/s10603-023-09557-4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85180688439&doi=10.1007%2fs10603-023-09557-4&partnerID=40&md5=a1abfbf288b41bfb00cd9119155409e3,01687034,Scopus,Climate; Consumer behaviour; Food policy; School meals; Sustainability; Sweden,"This controlled intervention study focused on optimizing a school lunch menu to achieve a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The objective was to evaluate the impact of introducing a low-carbon menu on pupils’ acceptance of school meals, as well as to assess whether providing information about the menu change independently influenced pupils’ acceptance. The study was conducted across six compulsory schools in a Swedish municipality, divided into three groups: schools implementing a menu change only (Menu), schools implementing a menu change with clear information provided to pupils (Menu + Info), and control schools serving the standard menu (Control). During a seven-week baseline period, all schools served the standard menu. Subsequently, for seven weeks, Menu and Menu + Info schools transitioned to a low-carbon menu achieved through the utilization of low-carbon recipes—reducing the proportion of food items with significant climate footprints while maintaining the recommended nutritional standards. In Menu + Info schools, pupils were presented with an informative video about the menu change during class. The acceptance of the low-carbon menu was evaluated through daily measurements of food consumption, plate waste, and meal satisfaction surveys. The study’s findings revealed that neither the menu change nor the information significantly affected the pupils’ acceptance of the new menu. These results align with prior studies, reinforcing the viability of employing low-carbon recipes to reduce the climate footprint of school meals. Moreover, this study demonstrates that providing supplemental information for transparency or educational purposes can be implemented without adversely affecting menu acceptance. © The Author(s) 2023."

Design/methodology/approach: The energy and nutrient content of menus were compared with recommendations of the Turkey Dietary Guidelines (TUBER) 2022. Nutrient profiles of hospital menus were evaluated using Nutrient Rich Food 9.3 (NRF 9.3) and SAIN-LIM models. The carbon and water footprints of the menus were calculated and compared with those of the Mediterranean diet. Findings: Menus’ energy and nutrient content did not conform with TUBER 2022. The SAIN-LIM score of Hospital A (5.7 ± 1.1) was significantly higher than that of Hospitals C (4.8 ± 0.7, p = 0.001) and E (5.1 ± 0.7, p = 0.025). The carbon footprint of Hospital A was significantly lower (2.6 ± 0.3 kg CO2 eq/person/day) and that of Hospital D (4 ± 0.9 kg CO2 eq/person/day) was significantly higher than those of others (p < 0.001). While other menus were similar (p > 0.05), the water footprint of Hospital A was significantly lower (3.5 ± 0.7 L/kg, p < 0.001). In addition, if the menus were suitable for the Mediterranean diet, a reduction of 2.2–23.4% in the carbon footprint and 37.5–58.6% in the water footprint could be achieved. Moreover, menus’ carbon and water footprints were negatively correlated with NRF 9.3 and SAIN-LIM scores. Research limitations/implications: The primary aim should be to ensure that the planned menus follow the dietary guidelines. In addition, it is an undeniable fact that sustainable nutrition is a complex process with many dimensions. However, it seems possible to improve the nutrient profiles of the menus and reduce their environmental footprint with minor changes to be made in food services. Practical implications: It seems possible to improve the nutrient profiles of the menus and reduce their environmental footprint with minor changes. For both health and environmental impacts, food services should switch to menus suitable for the Mediterranean diet. Originality/value: The findings provide new insights into hospital menus’ quality and environmental impact. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Mitigating climate change while maintaining economic growth is a critical challenge. We investigated the impact of energy efficiency on economic growth and environmental sustainability in the ten most energy-efficient countries from 1990 to 2019, using energy access, energy security, and energy depletion as moderator variables. To this aim, a thorough empirical analysis was performed, and advanced econometric techniques were employed. The Westerlund panel co-integration test results indicate the existence of long-run relationships within the variables considered. Specifically, findings show that energy intensity, access, and security were positively associated with CO2 emissions, ecological footprint, and economic growth. At the same time, energy depletion was negatively associated with economic growth and positively related to CO2 emissions and ecological footprint. These findings demonstrate that energy intensity, access, and security positively impact economic growth and degrade the environment. This empirical evidence suggests that economies should simultaneously achieve economic and environmental goals by decoupling energy consumption from economic growth, which can be accomplished through improvements in energy efficiency. © 2023 International Association for Gondwana Research"

The mechanical and durability properties of UHPC-CAM specimens made with the different fibre types were tested and compared. The microstructure of the samples was examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The environmental impacts of the mix designs were assessed using the Impact 2002+ method, a life cycle assessment tool. The results showed that the UHPC-CAM made with glass or MSM fibres had a high compressive strength (>110 MPa) and improved ductility. These specimens also had low water absorption and high electrical resistance, indicating low corrosion risk. SEM analyses showed that the MSM fibres created a denser geopolymer matrix than the glass fibres. The UHPC-CAM was found to have a lower environmental impact than conventional UHPC in terms of human health, ecosystem quality, carbon dioxide footprint and use of resources. MSM fibres were determined to be the most eco-friendly fibres for UHPC-CAM production. © 2024 ICE Publishing. All rights reserved."

In Brazil, meat carries an important cultural value even if from an environmental perspective its production is related to negative impacts. We explored Brazilian meat consumption over time, according to income groups from the perspective of the food inequalities and food justice and we analyzed its impacts on the environment. We used data from the 2008 and 2017 Household Budget Surveys to estimate meat intake and meat prices according to income level. The environmental impact indicators were based on the WWF Report. We analyzed the relationship between income, meat price, and its consumption by linear regression model. Brazilian meat intake was 86 g/1000 kcal in 2008, which is considered high intake and Brazilians increased meat intake by 12% from 2008 to 2017, with variations according to types of meat and income levels. Individuals of the lowest income stratum did not increase their meat consumption, and they spent around 17 times more of their income to buy one kilogram of beef compared to people from the highest income group. There was a significant positive relationship between purchasing power and intake of meat across income groups. In 2017, meat contributed to 86% of the Brazilian diet’s carbon footprint. In Brazil, relevant factors for meat intake may be associated with restricted purchasing power, food affordability, rising prices and income inequalities. Our findings indicate the relevance not only of food availability and intake but also the local variables such as socio-economic inequalities and cultural meanings food can assume. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023."

However, COVID-19 disruptions forced a shift to remote work, challenging traditional travel practices and presenting an opportunity for carbon emission reduction. This study investigates the industry’s response to the “new normal” and its implications for mobility and sustainability. We employ a media industries approach and conduct open-ended interviews with industry leaders to examine the potential balance between remote work benefits and essential in-person aspects, questioning whether the industry should return to pre-pandemic travel levels or embrace remote work’s ecological and financial benefits. Our findings indicate that remote work suitability varies depending on project stage, involved personnel, and the existing social fabric. To facilitate travel-related carbon footprint monitoring for cable consortiums, we developed a calculator to determine the industry’s emissions when adopting remote work. Our interdisciplinary study also emphasizes mobility’s intricate role in subsea cable systems and broader media infrastructure studies. By scrutinizing corporate cultures, communication practices, and transportation infrastructures, we enhance the scholarly comprehension of the social fabric underpinning global digital networks and investigate potential shifts toward a more sustainable media industry. © The Author(s) 2023."

However, they can introduce outdoor pollutants to indoor environment of data centers and cause corrosion damage to the information technology equipment. To evaluate the reliability of information technology equipment under various thermal and air-pollution conditions, a mechanistic model based on multi-ion transport and chemical reactions was developed. The model was used to predict Cu corrosion caused by Cl2-containing pollutant mixtures. It also accounted for the effects of temperature (25 °C and 28 °C), relative humidity (50%, 75%, and 95%), and synergism. It also identified higher air temperature as a corrosion barrier and higher relative humidity as a corrosion accelerator, which agreed well with the experimental results. The average root mean square error of the prediction was 13.7 Å.

These materials contaminate plant residues, hampering their direct reuse due to the need for separation and cleaning. As a result, contaminated plant residues is often landfilled or incinerated. This study investigates the replacement of conventional plastic raffia and mulching film with biodegradable and compostable alternatives. Polypropylene raffia is compared with a biodegradable viscose polymer and compostable jute fibre, while polyethylene mulching film is compared with a biodegradable polylactic acid film. Conventional and novel alternatives are compared economically using Life-Cycle Costing and environmentally using Life-Cycle Assessment. The economic assessment is based on case studies with two horticultural companies in Almeria (south-eastern Spain), while the environmental analysis uses data from the Ecoinvent database. The use of biodegradable and compostable alternatives for raffia and mulching film proved to be 49% more expensive than conventional options. However, when conventional plastic waste is incinerated rather than landfilled, biodegradable and compostable alternatives have a lower carbon footprint. Although biodegradable and compostable options can be more expensive and have higher impacts in certain situations, proper waste management can lead to environmental benefits. With optimisation and incentives, these alternative options support the transition of horticulture to a sustainable circular economy. © 2023 The Authors"

The process entails capturing CO2 and injecting it into deep geological formations for permanent storage. However, the design and modeling of carbon sequestration projects entail significant challenges in assessing the risks and long-term consequences. The fate of CO2 in the subsurface is dictated by many processes including solute transport, multiphase compositional effects, and trapping mechanisms. The ability to properly capture these phenomena is limited by the abstraction of numerical models, the uncertainty in petrophysical characterization, and the modeling of the thermodynamic effects. In this work, we study the impact of each of these factors on the fate of CO2 injection in a meter-scale experimental setup. We model the evolution of the CO2 plume inside the tank using the compositional reservoir simulator IPARS (Integrated Parallel Accurate Reservoir Simulator). We then present an ensemble-based approach to quantify the uncertainties and study the predictability of the numerical models. The results emphasize the ability of the reservoir simulator to predict the evolution of CO2 in the FluidFlower experimental setup. They also highlight the importance of considering the uncertainty in experimental testing of petrophysical properties in the risk assessment of geological carbon storage projects. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023."

The EU initiated the “Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism” (CBAM) 2021 to achieve the 2050 net-zero-carbon emission objective. Land elements challenge Taiwan’s solar energy industry due to its territory scarcity. Installing the OFPV system is attainable after the sector has demonstrated convincing attempts on reservoirs, detention ponds, and sea coasts in the past few years. The results show the project will produce 4529.2 GWh over 25 years and subside approximately 2305.4 kilo-tons (kt) of CO2 emission. It generates an average of about 496 MWh daily into the grid, accounting for 1.41% of Taiwan’s 35 GWh peak energy generation. Additionally, the investor will achieve approximately US$43.8 million of potential carbon credit. The findings help PV systems’ CFI and decision-makers determine energy infrastructure strategies. Graphical abstract: Monthly power generation duration curves (Figure presented.) Highlights: As greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have not reached the promises, many countries addressed ensuring net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050 to curtail the global temperature rise by 1.5 °C. The EU initiated a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) to impose carbon credit from 2023. Establishing the EU emissions trading systems (ETS) benefits a zero-carbon economy and GHG emissions. The life cycle energy analysis (LCEA) is a practical energy return evaluation for carbon footprint inventory (CFI). Using the CFI of product-product category rules (CFP-PCR) formulated by Taiwan’s Environmental Protection Agency (TEPA), the author performed the global most extensive 181-MWp offshore FPV system at Taiwan’s Changhua Coastal Industrial Park in a 25-year lifespan. Discussion: Performing emission mitigation measures results in cost savings through enhanced energy efficiency; establishing ETS to serve carbon credit transactions will bring potential benefits [92]. The CFI is critical for organizations committed to taking proactive steps to address climate change and sustainability, and see-through addressing CFI strengthens stakeholder confidence and association with investors and customers. Taiwan’s land scarcity confines its PV industry development. It is crucial for the authorities to thoroughly investigate and affirm which coastal areas are accessible for erecting FPV to increase clean energy use, as improving the CFI is imperative. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Materials Research Society 2024."

Sustainability is a broad concept that includes goals such as conservation of natural resources, energy efficiency, waste management, and reducing environmental footprints. Green laboratories strive to minimise environmental footprints by embedding sustainability principles into their everyday practices. This involves improvements in energy consumption, water usage, chemical waste reduction, and recycling, ultimately, as well as lower waste disposal costs. Implementing green laboratory approaches provides many benefits, such as a smaller environmental footprint, increased energy efficiency, water conservation, and cost savings. Moreover, a rational test ordering process can effectively contribute to reducing environmental impacts in medical laboratories. Rational test ordering provides cost-effectiveness and reduces the carbon footprint. Establishing a green and sustainable laboratory culture in medical laboratories requires a permanent organisation in where all personnel participate. Training of the hospital management teams, clinicians, and laboratory professionals is a vital point. Methodology and quality indicators should be defined by international and national laboratory associations within the framework of a green and sustainable laboratory plan, and data should be collected. In conclusion, adopting green laboratory practices reduces environmental impacts, saves costs, and accelerates innovation processes. Setting quality targets and rational test ordering practices are also essential for sustainability. Applying sustainability principles in laboratory workplaces is an important step towards protecting the environment and leaving a more liveable world for future generations. © 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter."

Then, the criteria for selecting suppliers, transformer sites, and critical distribution hubs were weighted using the best–worst method. After weighing the criteria using the Complex Proportional Assessment of alternatives (COPRAS) technique, eight raw material suppliers, three potential transformer sites, and five main distribution hubs were selected for supply chain network design. The second part presented a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model to optimize the designed supply chain network. All three sustainability dimensions, i.e., economic, social, and environmental, were considered in developing the supply chain network. In the economic dimension, we sought to minimize total costs consisting of transportation costs, the cost of construction, maintenance, and closure of transformer and distribution sites, the cost of the capacity change of transformer and distribution sites, and the cost of production. In the social dimension, we sought to maximize the number of job opportunities created in each facility. We sought to minimize carbon and nitrous oxide footprints and water consumption in the environmental dimension. Furthermore, a fourth objective function was presented to minimize product delivery time in addition to the three dimensions of sustainability. Then the proposed mathematical programming model was solved using the LP-metric method, and the necessary comparisons were made between the results. Finally, agri-food industry executives were given a decision-making tool by generating Pareto frontier graphs. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023."
337,Is small or big solar better for the environment? Comparative life cycle assessment of solar photovoltaic rooftop vs. ground-mounted systems,Article,Roy R.; Pearce J.M.,International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment,29.0,2024,516,536,10.1007/s11367-023-02254-x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85179732884&doi=10.1007%2fs11367-023-02254-x&partnerID=40&md5=001d194def555135a3928c1949ca6ca9,09483349,Scopus,Environmental impact; Life cycle assessment; Photovoltaics; Rooftop solar; Solar energy; Utility-scale photovoltaics,"Purpose: Both the capital cost and levelized cost of electricity of utility-scale ground-mounted solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are less than those of representative residential-scale solar rooftop systems. There is no life cycle analysis (LCA) study comparing the environmental impact of rooftop PV system and large utility-scale solar PV system. This study aims to fill this knowledge gap and provide a comprehensive LCA of a representative 7.4 kWp rooftop and 3.5 MWp utility-scale solar PV systems from cradle to grave. Methods: The energy as well as CO2 and water footprint during the manufacture, use, and end of life of both systems will be quantified. The primary focus of this study will be on the LCA of racking/mounting systems as these are the greatest source of divergence between the two main system types. In addition, sensitivities are run on (1) PV module types, (2) footings for the ground-mounted systems, and (3) geographic locations in different states of the USA. Results: Overall, the embodied energy per kWp of the rooftop-mounted PV system is 21–54% lower than that of the utility-scale ground-mounted PV system. The higher embodied energy of the ground-mounted systems is so much larger than the rooftop systems that even sub-optimally oriented rooftops still have substantially lower energy payback times in all regions. Similarly, the greenhouse gas emissions attributed to the ground-mount system with rack a is 2.5 times, and ground-mount system with rack b is 1.2 times greater per kWp than that of the rooftop system. A rooftop solar PV system requires 21 to 54% less input energy, emits 18 to 59% less CO2eq. of greenhouse gas emissions, and consumes a reduced quantity of water ranging from 1 to 12% per kWp. The energy payback time of rooftop solar systems is approximately 51 to 57% lower than that of ground-mounted solar systems across all locations. Conclusions: Overall the CO2 payback time was 378 to 428% higher for ground-mounted PV compared to rooftop PV for the same modules and 125 to 142% higher for ground-mounted compared to rooftop PV for the most common modules used for both applications. Although water use is dominated by the PV modules themselves, it is important to note that the water consumption for the utility-scale ground rack is approximately 260 times (rack a) and 6 times (rack b) higher than that of the rooftop mounting structure. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2023."

Volatile anaesthetics are greenhouse gases that increase the carbon footprint of healthcare. Modelling studies indicate that total intravenous anaesthesia is less carbon intensive than volatile anaesthesia, with equivalent quality of care. In this observational study, we aimed to apply the findings of previous modelling studies to compare the carbon footprint per general anaesthetic of an exclusive TIVA strategy vs. a mixed TIVA-volatile strategy. This comparative retrospective study was conducted over 2 years in two French hospitals, one using total intravenous anaesthesia only and one using a mixed strategy including both intravenous and inhalation anaesthetic techniques. Based on pharmacy procurement records, the quantity of anaesthetic sedative drugs was converted to carbon dioxide equivalents. The primary outcome was the difference in carbon footprint of hypnotic drugs per intervention between the two strategies. From 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2022, 25,137 patients received general anaesthesia in the hospital using the total intravenous anaesthesia strategy and 22,020 in the hospital using the mixed strategy. The carbon dioxide equivalent footprint of hypnotic drugs per intervention in the hospital using the total intravenous anaesthesia strategy was 20 times lower than in the hospital using the mixed strategy (emissions of 2.42 kg vs. 48.85 kg carbon dioxide equivalent per intervention, respectively). The total intravenous anaesthesia strategy significantly reduces the carbon footprint of hypnotic drugs in general anaesthesia in adult patients compared with a mixed strategy. Further research is warranted to assess the risk–benefit ratio of the widespread adoption of total intravenous anaesthesia. © 2024 The Authors.

The prospect of implementing an Emissions Trading System (ETS) for shipping has come to prominence as a proposed mechanism for speeding up the decarbonisation of the industry, with the EU taking proactive action to include shipping within the EU ETS by 2023. This paper analyses and provides a qualitative review of the historical development of the discussions and actions taken at both global level (by the International Maritime Organization (IMO)) and at regional level within the EU. A SWOT analysis of the potential implementation of an ETS for shipping is then presented. The paper concludes that an ETS for shipping can incentivise greater investment in, and deployment of, green technologies that will have the effect of reducing the carbon footprint of the shipping industry. However, the speed and significance of this effect will depend upon the specific shipping market segment and the relative stage in shipping market cycles over time. It is further concluded that despite the imminent unilateral introduction of shipping into the EU ETS, it is important that the IMO continues its work to develop a global ETS that promotes a ‘level playing field’ for competition within the sector and eliminates the risk of carbon leakage. © The Author(s) 2023."

To enable such a fuel shift, the Swedish Government introduced a GHG emission reduction mandate of 27% by 2030 for aviation fuel sold in Sweden, forcing fuel suppliers to blend in biojet fuel in fossil jet fuel. A similar policy instrument is being discussed within the EU. Biojet fuels with life cycle GHG emissions 90% lower than those for fossil jet fuel are projected to be available by 2025, which by far exceeds the requirement of 65% lower emissions in the EU Renewable Energy Directive. The purpose of this study was to carry out life cycle assessments for a number of wood-fuel-based production chains near commercialization and to determine whether they meet the Swedish projection and the EU requirement. The study illustrates what can be achieved in a region with high availability of wood fuels and access to heat and power with low GHG emissions. The production chains studied include the production of hydrocarbon intermediates via (i) fast pyrolysis, (ii) hydrothermal liquefaction, (iii) thermal gasification followed by Fischer–Tropsch-synthesis, and (iv) cellulosic ethanol fermentation followed by upgrading of these four intermediates to biojet fuel and other liquid biofuels. The results show that all the production chains studied can deliver biojet fuels with 89–91% lower GHG emissions than fossil jet fuels. Non-fossil hydrogen is required to achieve low emissions in the upgrading of intermediates from fast pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction. © The Author(s) 2022."

Our hypotheses and research methods were preregistered via the Journal of Accounting Research’s registration-based editorial process. Manipulating the measurement units and visualizations of carbon footprint information on food labels, we quantify effects on consumers’ food choices. Treated consumers choose less carbon-intensive dishes, reducing their food-related carbon footprint by up to 9.2%, depending on the treatment. Effects are strongest for carbon footprint information expressed in monetary units (“environmental costs”) and color-coded in the familiar traffic-light scheme. A postexperimental survey shows that these effects obtain although few respondents self-report concern for the environmental footprint of their meal choices.

Furthermore, glass recycling remains poor in the United States, and most glass is left to landfill after a single use. The lack of recycling and the carbon footprint of manufacturing have made glass an environmentally damaging material despite its theoretical infinite recyclability. Additionally, glass has the potential to enable next-generation energy materials, enabling the necessary technology for a green economy.

Although many researchers have explored and analyzed this issue, there remains a gap between stakeholders of green agricultural development combined with low-carbon policies and green preferences that have been overlooked. To bridge this gap, a three-party evolutionary game model consisting of farmers, governments, and consumers is developed based on the government’s low-carbon policies and stakeholders’ green preferences. The six key parameters based on low-carbon policies and green preferences influencing strategic behavior are thoroughly discussed using numerical simulations. The findings reveal the following: (1) Appropriate subsidies policy and relatively high carbon prices are conducive to promoting agro-food green planting. (2) The three parties’ green preferences improve people’s low-carbon awareness in the market. (3) When the governments’ green preference coefficient is less than 1, they will choose positive regulation and enhance farmers’ and consumers’ green preferences through publicity and education. As farmers’ and consumers’ green preferences increase to a certain high level, governments choosing negative regulation can also reach an advanced evolutionary stable strategy. The results provide theoretical and practical guidance for the green development of agriculture, help governments formulate scientific low-carbon policies, and provide referential significance for improving the green preference of farmers and consumers. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023."

Design/methodology/approach: A mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is developed to study the relation between production makespan, energy consumption, maintenance actions and footprint, i.e. service level and sustainability measures. The speed scaling technique is used to control energy consumption, the capping policy is used to control CO2 footprint and preventive maintenance (PM) is used to keep the machine working in healthy conditions. Findings: It was found that ignoring maintenance activities increases the schedule makespan by more than 21.80%, the total maintenance time required to keep the machine healthy by up to 75.33% and the CO2 footprint by 15%. Research limitations/implications: The proposed optimization model can simultaneously be used for maintenance planning, job scheduling and footprint minimization. Furthermore, it can be extended to consider other maintenance activities and production configurations, e.g. flow shop or job shop scheduling. Practical implications: Maintenance planning, production scheduling and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are intertwined in the industry. The proposed model enhances the performance of the maintenance and production systems. Furthermore, it shows the value of conducting maintenance activities on the machine's availability and CO2 footprint. Originality/value: This work contributes to the literature by combining maintenance planning, single-machine scheduling and environmental aspects in an integrated MINLP model. In addition, the model considers several practical features, such as machine-aging rate, speed scaling technique to control emissions, minimal repair (MR) and PM. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."

After confirming cross-sectional dependency by using Breusch and Pagan (LM) test and Pesaran (CD) test, the second generational panel unit root test (CADF) of Pesaran is used to test the stationarity of variables and results reveal mixed order of integration. Furthermore, Westerlund (2007) test indicates that the variables are cointegrated and the panel ARDL approach is used to find the long-run and short-run relationship among the variables. Corruption and political instability have a positive and significant impact on carbon footprint and ecological footprint in the long run and short run except for corruption that has a negative effect on carbon footprint in the short run. Urbanization, foreign direct investment, and energy use have a significant positive impact on environmental degradation. The study also validates the existence of the Environment Kuznets curve (EKC) for South Asian countries. The findings suggest that to improve environmental quality, South Asian countries must enhance political stability and control of corruption. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023."

To ensure the long-lasting nature of these buildings, proper maintenance is imperative. However, in order to meet the evolving expectations of residents and minimize the environmental impact, a deep renovation is currently required. To successfully achieve the goals of this renovation wave and effectively address the personal needs of the homeowners, it is crucial to develop systemic renovation solutions that can be offered through a digital renovation passport. Consequently, the purpose of this study is to identify common damages, renovation requirements, and evaluate current renovation practices. The findings will serve as a crucial resource for the development of a digital renovation passport. In our study, we utilize rural wooden log houses (comprising 208 houses, 4 years of data) as our research subject. The building elements that are most in need of renovation are the external walls, roofs, and foundations, which require renovation in 77%, 63%, and 63% of the buildings, respectively. The primary cause of damage to the vulnerable structures is excessive moisture. Additionally, decay in the foundation can be attributed to factors such as erosion of mortar, frost, insufficient plinth height, inadequate foundation depth, and inadequate moisture protection. Recommendations provided by consultants primarily focus on restoring and preserving the dwellings’ original architectural appearance. As a result, they are deemed insufficient in terms of improving energy performance and indoor climate. This lack of comprehensive consultation is concerning as it fails to consider the potential for cost efficiency, minimizing disruption to occupants, and achieving a comprehensive end result. The absence of recommendations for enhancing indoor climate, energy efficiency, general living quality, and reducing the building’s carbon footprint performance highlight the necessity for such renovation solutions and the importance of educating professionals and homeowners. The study’s novelty lies in the establishment of statistical probabilities for damages and their causes, as well as the assessment of renovation and maintenance needs and the quality of existing recommendations. Results are scaled to the Estonian building stock, showing the renovation need on national scale. The findings can be incorporated into the digital renovation passport, along with specific renovation goals related to a given house. © 2024, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas. All rights reserved."

The research applies a carbon footprint method incorporating the burden of waste input biomass, a key innovation particularly important in the circular economy thinking where organic waste is seen as a valuable resource. The functional unit was one ton of unpackaged compost. The greenhouse gas emissions were quantified using SimaPro software and the Ecoinvent database, supplementing with literature data for processes not covered in the database. Uncertainty analysis, supported by Monte Carlo simulations, was conducted on various parameters, while uncertainties related to biological processes, such as composting and soil emissions and sinks, were specifically addressed through sensitivity analysis. One ton of compost resulted in 453 ± 18 kg of carbon dioxide equivalents, excluding soil carbon sinks (− 8%). Monte Carlo simulations indicated a coefficient of variation of 4.08%, while sensitivity analysis pinpointed nitrous oxides emissions post-compost application as the key influencing factor (± 14%) of the carbon footprint. Environmental sustainability of composting becomes apparent when compared to landfilling; each ton of biomass waste composted instead of landfilled reduces approximately 110 kg of carbon dioxide equivalents. The study concludes that composting is environmentally advantageous over landfilling, underscoring the need to include environmental burden of waste input biomass, particularly food waste, in compost carbon footprint evaluations. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Iranian Society of Environmentalists (IRSEN) and Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University 2023."

Throughout the years, researchers have considered slow steaming for improving the environmental footprint of maritime networks. In order to assess such strategies’ effectiveness on existing emissions, research also focuses on the accurate estimation of emission inventories. However, there is a significant gap concerning both fields when considering short-sea shipping, especially passenger shipping. Furthermore, while emissions are characterized by spatial aspects in several studies, there is an apparent gap in considering such aspects for detailed analysis purposes rather than only for visualization purposes. In this study, the Greek Coastal Shipping Network (GCSN) is considered, with its emissions estimated using a top-down method, creating a spatial emission inventory used for further spatial analysis for accurate identification of highly polluted areas. Results indicate that ship emissions do not spread homogeneously throughout the GCSN and that targeted interventions are necessary in several areas of the network. The effectiveness of spatially related slow steaming implementations is evaluated and compared with their implementation on the whole network. The study highlights the need for additional future emission mitigation strategies, such as service optimization, network restructuring, continuous emission monitoring, and fleet renewal with more environmentally efficient ships. The study’s aim is to fill the research gap regarding the environmental assessment of passenger shipping and the effects of slow steaming on such networks while presenting an adaptable GIS-based decision support system for enhanced decision-making regarding the environmental efficiency of maritime networks. © The Author(s) 2023."

However, it is important to acknowledge that researchers themselves engage in activities that have a significant environmental impact. Group meetings and conferences are under the spot due to their extensive contribution to emissions through travel, catering, hosting, and other event-related activities. To address this issue, our work aims to conduct an environmental diagnosis of an ongoing H2020 European project, focusing on the impacts associated with the periodical group meetings organized in each country involved. We also sought to evaluate researchers’ stance on online meetings and collected environmental and personal opinions through dedicated online forms. Results show that while travel is the primary contributor to emissions, catering, meeting structures, and hosting support should not be overlooked. Conference location and availability of public transportation also play a crucial role in the final impact of the event, as they affect directly the 87% share of emissions due to travels. Besides, using local distributors and reducing hotel stays (representing about 5% of the final impact) may reduce the potential environmental burden of these events. On the other side, besides the obtained positive feedback from online meetings, in-person activities are still more effective for reinforcing human bonds and collaborations. © The Author(s) 2023."
351,Advanced hybrid combustion systems as a part of efforts to achieve carbon neutrality of the vehicles,Article,Puškár M.; Kopas M.,MRS Energy and Sustainability,11.0,2024,123,135,10.1557/s43581-023-00079-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181670252&doi=10.1557%2fs43581-023-00079-7&partnerID=40&md5=4f10671ec7d7ebda2436d6f042cdf8d0,23292237,Scopus,efficiency; energy generation; environment; specific heat; sustainability; transportation,"Abstract: Global goals, including those of the EU, are focussed on transition to the green, circular and low-carbon economy. The intention within the framework of EU is to achieve the zero level of CO2 emissions for the new cars till the year 2035. An important part of this plan is the agreement between Germany and the European Union that the new vehicles equipped with the internal combustion engines can continue to be sold only in such a case if they will use solely the climate-neutral fuel. Therefore, the future will probably belong to application of the advanced low-temperature technologies in combination with the climate-sustainable fuels (e.g. synthetic fuels, hydrogen). The presented scientific-research work introduces two new low-temperature combustion systems, which were developed and patented at the national level. At the same time, these new combustion systems are tested in cooperation with a reputable automotive producer. It is necessary to emphasize such a positive fact that the obtained results prove relevance of the innovative combustion systems as well as their possible future applicability in the real vehicles as a part of the advanced hybrid drive system. Graphical abstract: (Figure presented.) Highlights: Nowadays, the significant efforts are focussed on reduction of gaseous emissions generated by the transport, what is resulting in development of electromobility. CO2 neutrality in the transport sector cannot be reached by the electromobility alone. A potential solution is a combination of the sustainable fuels and advanced low-temperature combustion technologies. These two systems, which are presented in the article, were the subject of experimental research and development. Discussion: Within the EU, there are strong efforts for a total restriction of internal combustion engines. The German Association of Automotive Industry (VDA) declares that “CO2 neutrality in the transport sector cannot be solved by the electromobility alone”. The official statement of VDA continues: “Even if, in ideal case, we had 15 million electric cars on the roads in 2030, most of the vehicles will still be equipped with combustion engines. Nowadays, 280 million cars are using combustion engines in everyday operation in the EU and there are 1.5 billion of them worldwide. Climate-neutral transport is impossible without new structure of global vehicle fleet and its decarbonisation”. According to VDA, the only solution, how to reduce emission footprint, using the current vehicle fleet, is application of the synthetic fuels. Therefore, still more resources should be invested into research and development of new sustainable fuels. © The Author(s) 2024."

Energy consumption of cloud servers is the main concern of cloud service providers since reducing energy consumption can bring them a lower operation cost (and hence a higher profit) and alleviate carbon footprints to the environment. Typically, the common power management techniques for enhancing energy efficiency would make cloud servers more vulnerable to soft errors and hence adversely impact the quality of services. Thus, reliability cannot be ignored in the design of methodologies for improving the energy efficiency of cloud servers. In this article, we aim to minimize the energy consumption of cloud servers under the soft-error reliability constraint by configuring the size and speed of servers. Specifically, we first derive the expected reliability based energy consumption of cloud servers to formulate the reliability-constrained energy minimization problem. We then leverage the reinforcement learning technique to obtain an optimal server configuration solution that maximizes system energy efficiency while maintaining the system reliability constraint. Finally, we perform extensive simulation experiments to analyze the relationship between system energy consumption and server configuration under varying arrival rates and execution requirements of service requests. Comparative experiments are also performed to validate the efficacy of the proposed learning-based server configuration scheme. Results show that compared to a benchmark method, the energy saved by the proposed scheme can reach up to 31.5%.  © 1963-2012 IEEE."

This study aims at assessing the lifetime environmental-economic sustainability of ammonia and hydrogen, as alternatives to diesel fuel for short sea shipping cargo vessels. A model is employed to calculate key performance indicators representing the lifetime financial sustainability and environmental footprint of the case ship using a realistic operating profile and considering several scenarios with different diesel substitution rates. Scenarios meeting the carbon emissions reduction targets set by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) for 2030 are identified, whereas policy measures for their implementation including the emissions taxation are discussed. The derived results demonstrate that the future implementation of carbon emissions taxation in the ranges of 136–965 €/t for hydrogen and 356–2647 €/t for ammonia can support these fuels financial sustainability in shipping. This study provides insights for adopting zero-carbon fuels, and as such impacts the de-risking of shipping decarbonisation. © 2024 The Authors"

The productivity of labor and capital came first, followed by the productivity of raw materials - producing more with less. Therefore, zero emissions can be viewed as a new standard of efficiency. The issue is organizing industrial clusters based on the zero emissions principle. This context has led to the development of case studies and demonstration projects to demonstrate how the zero emissions approach differs from other pollution prevention strategies. We investigate the impact of net-zero emissions by 2050 on the environmental sustainability of the top three CO2-emitting countries, using natural resource rents, economic growth, and financial development as moderator variables from 1971 to 2019. To achieve this objective, we developed an advanced applied econometric methodology. Firstly, Westerlund's panel co-integration suggests long-term relationships within the variables. Secondly, net-zero emissions by 2050 are negatively associated with environmental sustainability. Total natural resources rents, economic growth, and financial development are positively associated with the ecological footprint. Findings show that net-zero emissions by 2050 will improve environmental sustainability in the top three CO2-emitting countries. Moreover, natural resource depletion, economic growth, and financial development deteriorate the ecological sustainability of these economies. To maintain the environment's equilibrium and conserve ecosystems, governments should put research, development, deployment, and demonstration at the center of climate and energy policy. © 2023 International Association for Gondwana Research"

Within surgery, reducing the number of instruments that are sterilized and disposable supplies that are used for each operation may help achieve both goals. We wanted to measure the existing variability in surgical instrument and supply choices and assess whether standardization could have a meaningful cost and environmental impact. Methods: We analyzed surgeon preference cards for common general surgery operations at our hospital to measure the number of sterilizable instrument trays and supplies used by each surgeon for each operation. From this data, we calculated supply costs, carbon footprint, and median operative time and studied the variability in each of these metrics. Results: Among the ten operations studied, variability in sterilizable instrument trays requested on surgeon preference cards ranged from one to eight. Variability in disposable supplies requested ranged from 17 to 45. Variability in open supply costs ranged from $104 to $4184. Variability in carbon footprint ranged from 17 to 708 kg CO2e. If the highest-cost surgeon for each operation switched their preference card to that of the median-cost surgeon, $245,343 in open supply costs and 41,708 kg CO2e could be saved. Conclusions: There is significant variability in the instrument and supply choices of surgeons performing common general surgery operations. Standardizing this variability may lead to meaningful cost savings and carbon footprint reduction, especially if scaled across the entire health system. © 2023 The Author(s)"
356,Does credit growth mitigate emission intensity in ASEAN countries?,Article,Masud M.M.; Noman A.H.M.; Akhtar R.; Selvarajan S.K.A.P.; Al-Mamun A.,Journal of International Development,36.0,2024,1324,1349,10.1002/jid.3857,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85178240733&doi=10.1002%2fjid.3857&partnerID=40&md5=d6c1ec3c05d5f8ed95bdfc91e3b479a8,09541748,Scopus,carbon emission; credit growth; ecological footprint and ASEAN countries,"In empirical studies, the disparity between financial development and environmental quality has prompted us to examine the impact of credit growth on environmental quality in ASEAN countries. These countries have experienced phenomenal credit growth over the past three decades due to their adoption of financial liberalisation, integration and innovation. In this study, we investigated the role of credit growth on environmental quality while controlling for several macroeconomic variables, including regulatory quality, natural resources, foreign direct investment, globalisation and per capita gross domestic product growth. Using static models (ordinary least square [OLS], random effect model, Panel Corrected Standard Error and partial spatial cross correlation) and dynamic models (dynamic OLS, dynamic random effect and two-step system generalised methods of moments (GMM) on data spanning from 1984 to 2019, we observed a nonlinear association between credit growth and environmental quality. The findings suggest that credit growth may simultaneously have favourable and detrimental effects on environmental quality. High credit growth can lead to increased emissions and environmental degradation through the promotion of fossil fuel-driven energy consumption, production and distribution of economic resources. However, if the government promotes regulatory quality and encourages lenders to invest more in green technologies and renewable and sustainable energy sources, credit growth may contribute to improved environmental quality. These results carry important policy implications. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

The clean energy transition includes shifting from a system based on fossil fuels to one dominated by clean, renewable energy to reduce carbon emissions to help meet global climate targets. We examine the impact of energy transition and the external balance of goods and services on China's environmental quality while considering the moderating role of urbanization, natural resources, and energy consumption from 1970 to 2019. In this study, we applied advanced econometric methods and conducted an extensive empirical analysis. Overall, the results conclude that energy transition, the external balance of goods and services, natural resources, and renewable energy consumption are negatively associated with the ecological footprint. However, urbanization and non-renewable energy consumption are positively linked with that footprint. Environmental sustainability is improved by energy transition, natural resource abundance, and renewable energy consumption. Urbanization and non-renewable energy consumption degrade environmental sustainability. Policymakers are suggested to support accelerating the energy transition by deploying renewable energy, encouraging policies that establish the appropriate environment for the extensive penetration of renewables, and balancing the national urban structure that strengthens the self-sustained urban development to guarantee a sustainable future. Future research directions and study limitations are discussed. © 2023"

The transition away from the jet fuel-powered conventional airplane towards battery-powered electrified aircraft will impose extra charging requirements on airports. In this paper, we first quantify the increase in energy demands at several airports across the United States (US), when commercial airline carriers partially deploy hybrid electric aircraft (HEA). We then illustrate that smart charging and minor modifications to flight schedules can substantially reduce peak power demands, and in turn the needs for grid infrastructure upgrade. Motivated by our data analysis, we next formulate an optimization problem for flight rescheduling that incorporates HEA charging considerations. This problem jointly decides flight schedules and charging profiles to manage airport congestion and peak power demands. We further consider mechanisms via which airlines and airports can negotiate HEA assignments using said optimization problem. Finally, we illustrate the efficacy of our formulation through a case study on the John F. Kennedy International Airport. © 2000-2011 IEEE."

The purpose of this qualitative interview study was to understand anaesthetists’ perspectives on the carbon footprint of anaesthesia, and views on shifting practice towards more environmentally sustainable options. Anaesthetists were recruited from four hospitals in Western Sydney, Australia. Data were organised according to the capability–opportunity–motivation model of behaviour change. Twenty-eight anaesthetists were interviewed (July−September 2021). Participants’ age ranged from 29 to 62 years (mean 43 years), 39% were female, and half had completed their anaesthesia training between 2010 and 2019. Challenges to the wider use of greener anaesthetic agents were identified across all components of the capability–opportunity–motivation model: capability (gaps in clinician skills and experience, uncertainty regarding research evidence); opportunity (norms, time, and resource pressures); and motivation (beliefs, habits, responsibility and guilt). Suggestions for encouraging a shift to more environmentally friendly anaesthesia included access to education and training, implementing guidelines and audit/feedback models, environmental restructuring, improving resource availability, reducing low value care, and building the research evidence base on the safety of alternative agents and their impacts on patient outcomes. We identified opportunities and challenges to reducing the carbon footprint of anaesthesia in Australian hospitals by way of system-level and individual behavioural change. Our findings will be used to inform the development of communication and behavioural interventions aiming to mitigate carbon emissions of healthcare. © The Author(s) 2023."

Although ruminants are much studied due to their large contribution to climate change impact, monogastrics are also known to carry a significant load, and mitigation options need investigation. Here, the climate change impact and water scarcity impact of Finnish pork production was investigated using the life cycle assessment approach. Methods: As the importance of communicating reliable environmental information has been acknowledged in the EU, methods and guidance for this purpose have been developed. Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules have also been published for several food product categories, although not yet for meat. Here, the life cycle assessment methods were used based on PEFCR guidance and the draft version of red meat PEFCR guidance to achieve a reliable, transparent and comparable assessment. Results: Finnish pork production resulted in a climate change impact of 3.6 kg CO2 eq. kgCW−1 and a water scarcity impact of 0.69 m3 eq. kgCW−1. The largest contribution to the climate change impact came from feed crop production, with an impact of 43%. Land-use changes were included, and their contribution to the Finnish pork climate change impact was 3%. Similarly, in the water scarcity impact, feed crop production was a major contributor, with 41% from fattening pig feed production. Significant contributions to both categories also came from piglet production, including feed crop production, and to the climate change impact from manure storage. Conclusions: Finnish production was seen to already largely utilise sidestreams and domestic feed ingredients, although, e.g. soybean is still used. Based on the results, in mitigating the environmental impacts of Finnish pork production, attention should especially be paid to the resource-efficient production of domestic feed crops and reduced use of organic soils. As current assessment models are unable to grasp the impacts of regenerative farming techniques, the development of LCA methods is also required. Water scarcity impact was seen to be largely affected by the utilisation of feed crops originating from water-scarce countries. As a mitigation measure, the procurement of these feed crops and ingredients should therefore be directed to water-abundant areas and from production which does not depend on irrigation water or the extensive use of synthetic inputs. © The Author(s) 2023."

In this techno-economic analysis, single cell protein (SCP) produced via gas fermentation of carbon dioxide, oxygen, and hydrogen is studied as an animal feed source to replace fishmeal or soybean meal. Using wind-powered water electrolysis to produce hydrogen and oxygen with carbon dioxide captured from corn ethanol, the minimum selling price (MSP) of SCP is determined to be $2070 per metric ton. An emissions comparison between SCP, fishmeal, and soybean meal shows that SCP has a carbon intensity as low as 0.73 kg CO2-equiv/kg protein, while fishmeal and soybean meal have an average carbon intensity of 2.72 kg CO2-equiv/kg protein and 0.85 kg CO2-equiv/kg protein, respectively. Moreover, SCP production would occupy 0.4% of the land per ton of protein produced compared to soybean meal and would disturb less than 0.1% of the marine ecosystem currently disturbed by fishmeal harvesting practices. These results show promise for the future economic viability of SCP as a protein source in animal feed and indicate significant environmental benefits compared to other animal feed protein sources. © 2024 American Chemical Society."

Considering this aspect, a Fibre-Reinforced Geopolymer Concrete (FGC) was developed with 8 and 10 molarities (M). At elevated temperatures, concrete experiences deterioration of its mechanical properties which is in some cases associated with spalling, leading to the building collapse. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, six geopolymer-based mix proportions are prepared with crimped steel fibre (SF), polypropylene fibre (PF), basalt fibre (BF), a hybrid mixture consisting of (SF + PF), a hybrid mixture with (SF + BF), and a reference specimen (without fibres). After temperature exposure, ultrasonic pulse velocity, physical characteristics of damaged concrete, loss of compressive strength (CS), split tensile strength (TS), and flexural strength (FS) of concrete are assessed. A polynomial relationship is developed between residual strength properties of concrete, and it showed a good agreement. Findings: The test results concluded that concrete with BF showed a lower loss in CS after 925 °C (i.e. 60 min of heating) temperature exposure. In the case of TS, and FS, the concrete with SF had lesser loss in strength. After 986 °C and 1029 °C exposure, concrete with the hybrid combination (SF + BF) showed lower strength deterioration in CS, TS, and FS as compared to concrete with PF and SF + PF. The rate of reduction in strength is similar to that of GC-BF in CS, GC-SF in TS and FS. Originality/value: Performance evaluation under fire exposure is necessary for FGC. In this study, we provided the mechanical behaviour and physical properties of SF, PF, and BF-based geopolymer concrete exposed to high temperatures, which were evaluated according to ISO standards. In addition, micro-structural behaviour and linear polynomials are observed. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."

The measurement data were studied alongside long-term monitoring data from a sixth WWTP. The calculated emission factors (EFs) varied from near 0 to 1.8% relative to the influent total nitrogen load. The results confirmed a significant seasonality of N2O emissions as well as a notable variation between WWTPs in the emission level, which a single fixed EF cannot represent. Wastewater temperature was one explanatory factor for the emission seasonality. Both low and high emissions were measured from denitrifying–nitrifying activated sludge (AS) processes, while the emissions from only nitrifying AS processes were consistently high. Nitrite (NO2- ) at the end of the aerobic zones of the AS process was linked to the variability in N2O emissions during the cold period. © 2024 The Authors."

A new system has been developed that integrates the use of biomass as a fuel, chemical looping, and syngas production in a polygenerating system of interconnected reactors, which is very promising in maximizing the effectiveness of hydrogen production without a carbon footprint (or with a negative carbon footprint). A procedure and results of calculations of the composition and consumption of generator gas, material balance of a chemical looping system, heat values of chemical reactions in a system of interconnected reactors, heat balance and temperatures in individual reactors, and heat and material balances in exhaust gas heat recovery units are presented. The effect of the main operating conditions of a chemical looping system on temperatures in the reactors was determined on the basis of the calculated and material balances. The calculated efficiency in terms of hydrogen production (75.93%) is given. This value fits well into the broad outline of the results obtained in simulation of similar systems for chemical looping hydrogen production from metal oxides and can be considered as a guideline when developing engineering solutions within the scope of the proposed process flow diagram.

This general lack of PCF data is because the data needed for comprehensive environmental analyses are typically not available in the early molecular design stages. Several predictive tools have been developed to estimate the PCF of chemicals, which are applicable to only a narrow range of common chemicals and have limited predictive ability. Here, we propose FineChem 2, which is based on a novel transformer framework and first-hand industry data, for accurately predicting the PCF of chemicals. Compared to previous tools, FineChem 2 demonstrates significantly better predictive power, and its applicability domains are improved by ∼75% on a diverse set of chemicals on the global market, including the high-production-volume chemicals identified by regulators, daily chemicals, and chemical additives in food and plastics. In addition, through better interpretability from the attention mechanism, FineChem 2 may successfully identify PCF-intensive substructures and critical raw materials of chemicals, providing insights into the design of more sustainable molecules and processes. Therefore, we highlight FineChem 2 for estimating the PCF of chemicals, contributing to advancements in the sustainable transition of the global chemical industry. © 2024 The Authors."

In the proposed integrated carbon capture and utilization (I-CCU) solution, methanol is produced with hydrogen from an electrolysis plant and with CO2 captured at an oxyfuel cement plant; the oxygen delivered to the oxyfuel cement plant comes from the same electrolysis plant that provides hydrogen, which eliminates the need for an air separation unit (ASU). Due to the high energy demand for electrolysis, the carbon footprint of the solution depends on the carbon intensity of the power grid; any advantage from avoiding an ASU is overshadowed by the energy requirements of I-CCU. Consequently, BAU outperforms I-CCU in geographical regions with specific electricity emissions larger than 0.2 kgCOd2/kW h, which corresponds to most of Europe. Furthermore, CCS is practically always a better alternative to I-CCU; only when there is renewable electricity available in abundance, I-CCU is better. Finally, it should be highlighted that using additional low-carbon electricity sources to drive I-CCU is not the most efficient use in terms of emission reductions per unit of low-carbon electricity. While the pursuit of (energy) integration and circularity should always be considered, our work emphasizes the necessity of conducting a comparative analysis, such as that presented here, to guarantee the achievement of the desired objectives. © 2024 The Authors."

Climate change is the primary factor responsible for the degradation of this system over time. The far-reaching consequences of climate change impact various aspects of our lives, including the physical environment, urban settings, human activities, economy, technology, agriculture, food production, access to clean water, and public health, all of which are widely acknowledged. Human-induced greenhouse gas emissions in these areas significantly trigger global climate change. Hence, addressing and mitigating the environmental damage from these emissions and the interconnected climate change phenomena is imperative. This situation is where the concept of ""carbon footprint"" gains prominence in assessing the extent of this damage. Carbon footprint serves as an essential measure in managing and curbing climate change. This study focused on controlling and mitigating carbon emissions, one of the primary greenhouse gasses responsible for climate change, by implementing spatial interpolation techniques based on Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The investigation targeted the Beşirli neighborhood in the Ortahisar district of Trabzon province. Data concerning electricity and natural gas usage were acquired from relevant institutions to perform carbon footprint calculations. Subsequently, carbon footprint calculations were conducted utilizing the acquired data within the specified region. The resulting outputs were systematically organized, integrated into the GIS environment, and linked to their respective geographical locations. Eventually, region-specific carbon footprint distribution maps were generated using selected spatial interpolation methods. These maps enabled a spatial observation of points exhibiting variability in terms of carbon emissions, thereby highlighting the carbon footprints evident in the region. The ultimate goal of this endeavor is to propose practical measures for minimizing the adverse environmental impacts by suggesting strategies to reduce and prevent carbon footprints associated with carbon emissions in the relevant areas. © 2024, Murat Yakar.

Oxalic acid from CO2 and isosorbide from biomass are interesting rigid building blocks for high Tg polyesters. The biodegradability of a family of novel fully renewable (bio- and CO2-based) poly(isosorbide-co-diol) oxalate (PISOX-diol) copolyesters was studied. We systematically investigated the effects of the composition on biodegradation at ambient temperature in soil for PISOX (co)polyesters. Results show that the lag phase of PISOX (co)polyester biodegradation varies from 0 to 7 weeks. All (co)polyesters undergo over 80% mineralization within 180 days (faster than the cellulose reference) except one composition with the cyclic codiol 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol (CHDM). Their relatively fast degradability is independent of the type of noncyclic codiol and results from facile nonenzymatic hydrolysis of oxalate ester bonds (especially oxalate isosorbide bonds), which mostly hydrolyzed completely within 180 days. On the other hand, partially replacing oxalate with terephthalate units enhances the polymer’s resistance to hydrolysis and its biodegradability in soil. Our study demonstrates the potential for tuning PISOX copolyester structures to design biodegradable plastics with improved thermal, mechanical, and barrier properties. © 2024 The Authors.

Yet, to monitor and assess the impacts of circular economy, indicators cannot be limited to mass-based indicators; we argue assessments should also include environmental and economic effects. Towards this end, these impacts can be quantified by an advanced model based on life cycle thinking, entailing the use of life cycle assessment and costing (LCA/LCC). Calculating these effects for municipal waste management is challenging due to gaps in available data for estimating generated waste. We propose a methodology to estimate more finely the amounts of waste generated in the Member States, complemented with LCA/LCC. The results highlight that important inconsistencies in municipal waste data reporting exist and that recycling rates calculated from these are lower than hitherto estimated. The impacts quantification shows great performance variation across EU27, with C-footprint ranging from −490 to 539 kg CO2-eq. t−1. Potentials for improvement are substantial and can bring up to 103 Mt CO2-eq. additional annual saving, reducing costs (calculated as Full Environmental LCC) of waste management by 8.4 billion EUR and bringing 206,100 new jobs in the sector. The approach presented highlights the rationale for improved data management on waste statistics and the potential for harmonised models. It also paves the way for more sophisticated impact analyses relevant for policymaking, by bringing a richer perspective to the environmental and economic impacts of waste management on top of tracking generated, collected and recycled waste flows. © 2023 The Author(s)"

The anaerobic/aerobic/anoxic (AOA) process has recently shown promising potential in energy savings and advanced nitrogen removal, but it still needs to be comprehensively explored in relation to N2O emissions for its carbon reduction advantages. In this study, a novel gas-collecting continuous flow reactor was designed to comprehensively evaluate the emissions of N2O from the gas and liquid phases of the AOA process. Additionally, the measures of enhancing endogenous denitrification (ED) and self-enriching anaerobic ammonium oxidation (Anammox) were employed to optimize nitrogen removal and achieve N2O reduction in the anoxic zone. The results showed that enhanced ED coupled with Anammox led to an increase in the nitrogen removal efficiency (NRE) from 67.65 to 81.96%, an enhancement of the NO3- removal rate from 1.76 mgN/(L h) to 3.99 mgN/(L h), and the N2O emission factor in the anoxic zone decreased from 0.28 to 0.06%. Impressively, ED eliminated 91.46 ± 2.47% of the dissolved N2O from the upstream aerobic zone, and the dissolved N2O in the effluent was reduced to less than 0.01 mg/L. This study provides valuable strategies for fully evaluating N2O emissions and N2O reduction from the AOA process. © 2024 American Chemical Society."

Two ore types were identified – a haematite-dominated, oolitic type and a more massive, magnetite-dominated type. The haematite-dominated ore had a higher phosphorus content, up to 0.6% in the iron oxide minerals, than the magnetite-dominated type (0.3% P). Owing to the very fine-grained texture of the gangue minerals, reducing the phosphorus content to levels suitable for steelmaking (below 0.05% P) by conventiobal means would entail an energy-intensive process with a high carbon footprint. Preliminary leaching test work using a sulphurous geothermal water as lixiviant, assisted by solar thermal acceleration, gave very promising results, removing 0.13% of the residual P (or 21.7% removal of total P) from the high-phosphorus oolitic ore. © 2024 South African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy.

In the proposed inventory model for deteriorating items, demand is dependent on the selling price and green technology investment (or carbon reduction investment) for the green product (GP), as well as an investment in price-based preservation technology to slow down the pace of deterioration. Furthermore, emission reduction measures are put in place to reduce carbon emissions (CEs). Design/methodology/approach: The current study executed a thorough literature review to determine how to improve supply chain management performance. Furthermore, assumptions are made to fill research gaps, and a mathematical model is created to address the problem mentioned above. To collect the data, the available inventory literature was reviewed. Additionally, numerical illustrations and sensitivity analyses are presented to emphasize the model's robustness. Findings: The research indicates that it is more prudent to invest in preservation technology based on its selling price in order to control the rate of deterioration. In addition, the proposed model facilitates the management of deteriorated waste through salvage trading and emission reduction investment. The findings validate sustainable practices with a 20.86% increase in profit and a 21.4% decrease in CEs, thereby signifying environmental and economic benefits. Originality/value: The proposed model enhances understanding of the impact of investments in price-based preservation technology and carbon reduction efforts on consumer perceptions of their intention to purchase GPs. Moreover, the study provides valuable insights by identifying important recommendations for policymakers regarding areas that require further investigation.

In this study, we assessed two extremophilic (acid-tolerant) microalgal strains, Desmodesmus sp. MAS1 and Heterochlorella sp. MAS3, for their ability to thrive in high-alkaline environments as existing in winery wastewater. These strains showed a rapid growth rate (1.10-1.30 d-1), a substantial increase in chlorophyll, and efficient removal of carbon (70-80%) as well as nitrogen and phosphate (80-90%) during mixotrophic cultivation in highly alkaline winery wastewater. Metabolic analysis unveiled the interplay among CO2 fixation, nitrogen assimilation, amino acid metabolism, and other key pathways, highlighting the ability of the microalgal strains to change their metabolic processes in response to extreme-pH conditions. Especially noteworthy is the elevated expression of organic acids in strain MAS1, suggesting their vital role in nutrient uptake in the alkaline environment. Harnessing these extremophilic traits negates the need for wastewater pretreatment and reduces both energy and chemical footprints, aligning with several UN Sustainable Development Goals. Our study thus presents new insights into the extremophilic nature of microalgal strains for remediation, biomass production, and broader biotechnological applications, paving the way for sustainable industrial innovations. © 2023 American Chemical Society"

The balance and dynamic changes in carbon emissions and carbon fixation of urban tourism in the past ten years were compared. The results show that (1) tourism carbon emissions in the Yellow River Basin are generally on the rise, along with a distribution characteristic of downstream > middle reaches > upstream with obvious characteristics of urban agglomeration centrality within the basin; (2) the carbon carrying capacity of tourism is higher than that of tourism. The growth of carbon emissions is relatively slow, showing a spatial distribution pattern of high in the west and low in the east, which is mainly related to the geographical environment and economic development of the city; (3) the tourism carbon emissions and tourism carbon carrying capacity in the upstream areas can basically maintain a balance, but in the middle and lower reaches of the region, they show a carbon surplus. There is a significant positive spatial correlation in urban net tourism carbon emissions, and the clusters are mainly H-H and L-L. © The Author(s) 2024."

A pilot unit, including a modified MS, adjustable to different meshes (including 20 and 15 μm) was operated continuously downstream to the PST at the Büsnau wastewater treatment plant in Stuttgart, Germany, and monitored for more than half a year. A strategy involving time-dependent backwashing and recirculation of MS permeate was employed to remove as much POC as possible from primarily treated wastewater, thereby extending the application of the MS. The optimal configuration, PST þ 15-μm MS, achieved maximum removal efficiencies of 90% for turbidity, 90% for total suspended solids (TSS), and 80% for total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD). These results are significant, as comparable removal levels for these parameters were conventionally achieved using less eco-friendly methods such as physiochemical APT, including coagulation–flocculation with iron or aluminum salts followed by microscreening or sedimentation. However, this study’s findings ascertained that solo physical APT applications could produce equivalent effluent quality with a much smaller footprint while keeping the advanced primary treated wastewater suitable for biological treatment. © 2024 The Authors."

However, lignin conversion remains challenging, and the alternative (combustion) can emit harmful air pollutants. This study explores the economic and environmental trade-offs between lignin combustion and microbial utilization for producing bisabolene as a representative biobased fuel or chemical. Results for switchgrass and clean pine-based biorefineries show that using lignin to increase fuel yields rather than combusting it reduces the capital expenditures for the boiler and turbogenerator if the facilities process more than 1100 bone-dry metric tons (bdt) feedstock/day and 560 bdt/day, respectively. No comparable advantage was observed for lower-lignin sorghum feedstock. Deconstructing lignin to bioavailable intermediates and utilizing those small molecules alongside sugars to boost product yields is economically attractive if the overall lignin-to-product conversion yield exceeds 11-20% by mass. Although lignin-to-fuel/chemical conversion can increase life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, most of the lignin can be diverted to fuel/chemical production while maintaining a >60% life-cycle GHG footprint reduction relative to diesel fuel. The results underscore that lignin utilization can be economically advantageous relative to combustion for higher-lignin feedstocks, but efficient depolymerization and high yields during conversion are both crucial to achieving viability. © 2023 American Chemical Society."

Long-run parameter estimates derived from AMG and CCEMG, increasing income and nonrenewable energy consumption, have a significant positive impact on the ecological footprint, while countries that consume more renewable energy have seen an improvement in the quality of the environment. Conversely, neither income inequality nor globalization has a significant effect on national EFs. Evidence from the estimation of the panel threshold error correction model, where GDP growth is used as the transition variable, indicates a significant threshold effect, which supports a nonlinear relationship among the variables by identifying two distinct growth regimes: lower and upper. For the estimation sample, the positive and significant parameter estimates for economic growth in both growth regimes do not support the EKC hypothesis. The results indicate that renewable and nonrenewable energy consumption has a larger impact on the EF in the upper than lower growth regime. The threshold estimates are in line with the linear long-run estimates that do not indicate that income inequality has a significant impact on ecological footprint. However, globalization appears to negatively affect environmental quality in the lower growth regime. © The Author(s) 2024."

There is an increasing trend in research and innovation to replace synthetic fiber with natural fiber to reduce the environmental carbon footprint. However, using natural fiber in polymer composite is challenging because of the lower mechanical strength and hydrophilic nature of the natural fiber. The literature reported on mechanical and moisture resistance properties of coir fiber polymer composite with different fiber orientations is very limited. Thus, this research aims to evaluate the mechanical properties (flexural and impact) and moisture resistance properties of the coir fiber reinforced composite. The fiber ware stacked with three different fiber orientations, namely 0°/0°/0°, 0°/90°/0° and 0°/+ 45°/0°. The composite was fabricated with the hand lay-up technique. The overall results indicated that the composite specimens with the orientation of 0°/0°/0° indicated the best flexural properties and water penetration resistance in the composite. The stacking sequence of 0°/ + 45°/0° gave the best impact properties. However, at this orientation, it gave the lowest water resistance among the studied configurations. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to the Korean Fiber Society."
382,Evaluating metrics for quantifying the climate-change effects of land-based carbon fluxes,Article,Brandão M.; Kirschbaum M.U.F.; Cowie A.L.,International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment,29.0,2024,328,343,10.1007/s11367-023-02251-0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85178480556&doi=10.1007%2fs11367-023-02251-0&partnerID=40&md5=9e4b9fd4f8bfb76af19c3f8d2cd366d0,09483349,Scopus,Bioenergy; Characterisation factor; Climate-change policy; Global change; Mitigation; Temperature,"Purpose: Growing concern over climate change has increased interest in making use of the biosphere to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by replacing fossil energy with bioenergy or increasing land-based carbon storage. An assessment of the effectiveness of these options requires detailed quantification of their climate-change mitigation potential, which must employ appropriate metrics to translate biophysical changes into climate-change impacts. However, the various currently available metrics use different proxy measures (e.g. radiative forcing, temperature changes, or others) as surrogates for climate-change impacts. Use of these different proxies can lead to contradictory conclusions on the most suitable policy options. We aim to provide criteria for the objective evaluation of metrics to build understanding of the significance of choice of metric and as a step towards building consensus on the most appropriate metric to use in different contexts. Methods: We compared fifteen available metrics that represent conceptual differences in the treatment of biospheric carbon fluxes and the proxies used to approximate climate-change impacts. We proposed a set of evaluation criteria related to the metrics’ relevance, comprehensiveness, ease of application and acceptance by the research and policy community. We then compared the different metrics against these criteria. Results and conclusions: The different metrics obtained scores from 10 to 21 (out of 30). The Climate-Change Impact Potential scored highest against the criteria, largely because it relates climate-change impacts to three different aspects of temperature changes; thus, it most comprehensively covers the different aspects of climate-change impacts. Therefore, according to our evaluation criteria, it would be the most suitable metric for assessing the effect of different policy options on marginal climate-change impacts. We demonstrated that the proposed evaluation criteria successfully differentiated between the fifteen metrics and could be used as a basis for selecting the most appropriate metric for specific applications. © 2023, The Author(s)."

This passive cooling solution is particularly interesting for marginal and smallholder farmers in remote, off-grid areas. Evaporative coolers are rarely deployed in these scenarios because there is a lack of simple, affordable, and small-scale systems. A charcoal cooling blanket has been designed and tested as an alternative evaporative cooler. The blanket can be made in any size from locally-sourced materials such as charcoal and hessian, or other biodegradable textiles. The cost of the blanket scales quasi-linearly with the length of the blanket. The blanket is semi-self-supporting and has several compartments to hold the charcoal, a material that is commonly used for evaporative coolers. It can be used throughout the fresh-produce supply chain. In laboratory experiments, the blanket cooled air and fruit temperatures by 5 °C below ambient (23 °C) at 40% relative humidity. This temperature was 2–3 °C above the wet-bulb temperature. The humidity inside a 56 l cooler was 85–95 %. In field experiments, a 600 l blanket cooler also achieved a temperature reduction of 2–3 °C below the outside air temperature. The materials to construct the blanket have a carbon footprint of 15 kg [CO2-eq] m−2. The environmental impact of operating a charcoal-blanket storage room of 33 m3 is therefore 200 times lower than that of a similar-sized commercial refrigeration unit for a 14 d storage period, which is a common storage period for many fruits and vegetables. © 2023 The Authors"

The rise in the number of landslides points to the unplanned development activities and lack of well-planned mitigation measures. The commonly adopted mitigation techniques have a high carbon footprint resulting in environmental imbalance. Hence, techniques that go hand in hand with the environment need to be properly studied. The major triggering factors, mechanisms involved and the common mitigation techniques for landslides are reviewed from published literature and discussed in detail in this paper which further focuses mainly on the bioengineering techniques for landslide mitigation. The efficiency of bioengineering technique depends on the hydromechanical behavior of the plant roots. On reviewing the effectiveness of plants in enhancing the hydromechanical properties of vegetated soil, it can be concluded that proper bioengineered use of plants of grass species like vetiver can be considered as an effective mitigation technique for shallow slope failures induced by rainfall. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Indian Geotechnical Society 2024."

We used the quarterly data, from 1998 to 2020, which is simulated by using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method for empirical estimations. The findings have reported the significant and positive coefficients for economic complexity and digital economy. On contrary, the digital infrastructure and technological advancement have provided the significant and negative coefficients. The results of digitalization indicators are diverse, mentioning that digitalization needs to be subcategorized to conclude the appropriate relationship between digitalization and carbon economy. We further report the findings on the basis of Saudi Vision 2030, which are useful for policy suggestions. The outcomes of this study are useful to form the environmental policies based on circular economy.

This is also relevant for the case of fisheries and LCAs of fish products. Fisheries' product systems show both multifunctionality because of the simultaneous co-catch of multiple species and potential constraints to supply due to natural stock limits or socially established limits such as quota systems. The performance of fisheries also varies across seasons, locations, vessels, and target species. In this study, we investigate the combined effect of modeling choices and variability on the uncertainty of LCA results of fish products. We use time series data from official Danish statistics for catch and fuel use of several fisheries disaggregated using a top-down procedure. We apply multiple modeling approaches with different assumptions regarding the type of partitioning, substitution, and constraints. The analysis demonstrates that, in the presence of relevant multifunctionality, the results are substantially affected by the modeling approach chosen. These findings are robust across years and fisheries, indicating that modeling choices contribute to uncertainty more than the variability in fishing conditions. We stress the need for a more careful alignment of research questions and methods for LCA studies of fisheries and recommend a very transparent statement of assumptions, combined with uncertainty and sensitivity analysis.

Methods Eligible patients were invited to telephone clinics, undertaking a satisfaction survey after consultation, focusing on perceived convenience, satisfaction, cost and travel arrangements (used to calculate potential environmental benefit). Provider opinion was also captured. Results Forty-eight of 60 patients attended, with 38 (63%) eligible for inclusion. Thirty-six of these 38 patients (95%) had a definitive outcome of tonsillectomy (27/38) or discharge (9/38). Thirty-three of the 38 patients (87%) responded to the survey and reported high satisfaction in all arms of questioning (mean Likert ranking = 4.7/5). A mean of 3.76 hours of missed work and 5.17kg carbon dioxide emission equivalents were saved per patient. Provider responses were positive towards ongoing remote consultation use. Conclusions Telephone consultation for adult patients considered for tonsillectomy is convenient to patients in terms of cost and time, reduces environmental harm and is associated with high patient and provider satisfaction. © 2024 Royal College of Surgeons of England.

It contributes to larger-scale challenges, such as climate change and biodiversity loss in food production. As a result, the purpose of this research is to develop strategies to grow the economy without harming the environment. Therefore, we revisit the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis, considering the impact of climate policy uncertainty along with other control variables. We investigated yearly panel data from 47 Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) nations from 1998 to 2021. Pooled regression, fixed effect, and the generalized method of moment (GMM) findings all confirmed the presence of inverted U-shaped EKC in BRI counties. Findings from this paper provide policymakers with actionable ideas, outlining a framework for bringing trade and climate agendas into harmony in BRI countries. The best way to promote economic growth and reduce carbon dioxide emissions is to push for trade and climate policies to be coordinated. Moreover, improving institutional quality is essential for strong environmental governance, as it facilitates the adoption of environmentally friendly industrialization techniques and the efficient administration of climate policy uncertainties. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024."

EFP index therefore includes six dimensions that are cropland, forestland, carbon, fishing grounds, grazing land, and built-up area. Human activities have impacted the environment, leading to global warming, widespread droughts, and diseases. The present study aims to investigate the role of renewable energy (RE) and energy efficiency on the EFP index. Past researchers have widely used carbon emission (CE) to represent environmental impact, and recent studies have shown that EFP index is a better proxy of environmental degradation. Therefore, the present research differs from past studies in that it compares on how the determinants of environmental degradation affects EFP index and CE. Panel dataset of the OECD countries from 1990 to 2020 is employed. The CS-ARDL, DCCEMG, and AMG techniques, which overcome dynamics, heterogeneity, and cross-sectional dependence, are employed. The main findings depict that RE significantly reduces EFP and CE, while economic growth significantly exacerbates them. Energy efficiency reduces CE, but does not significantly affect EFP. Non-renewable energy and research & development significantly increase CE, while an insignificant positive effect is observed with EFP. This paper shows that factors that significantly influence CE may not always significantly affect the EFP index. Thus, to reduce environmental degradation it is fundamental to understand on how each dimension of EFP is influenced. © The Author(s) 2024."

Both have excellent engineering properties to be used as building materials. FCA possesses properties of cementitious material, whereas ACFS possesses properties of coarse aggregate. This study examines some properties of concrete on the combined use of lime-activated FCA for the potential replacement of cement and ACFS for the total replacement of natural coarse aggregates. Concrete mixtures were prepared to replace cement by FCA 0–40% at an interval of 10%, using ACFS as coarse aggregates. Mechanical properties such as compressive strength and modulus of elasticity of FCA–ACFS concrete were compared to the established standards of normal concrete. The durability of such concrete as wear resistance was addressed. The microstructure of FCA–ACFS concrete was studied through the degree of hydration. Environmental impact aspects like embodied energy and carbon were studied. Besides, the sustainability of FCA–ACFS concrete was examined by comparing the environmental parameters such as embodied energy and embodied carbon with the functional parameters like compressive strength. The results related to strength, durability, microstructure, environmental impact and sustainability showed the positive effect of ACFS and FCA. Sustainable concrete with improved engineering properties can be prepared using FCA and ACFS. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Shiraz University 2023."

Delivering modern patient care requires a robust informatics team to move images from the imaging equipment to the workstations and the health care system. Radiology informatics is the field that manages medical imaging IT. This involves the acquisition, storage, retrieval, and use of imaging information in health care to improve access and quality, which includes PACS, cloud services, and artificial intelligence. However, the electricity consumption of computing and the life cycle of various computer components expands the carbon footprint of health care. The authors provide a general framework to understand the environmental impact of clinical radiology informatics, which includes using the international Greenhouse Gas Protocol to draft a definition of scopes of emissions pertinent to radiology informatics, as well as exploring existing tools to measure and account for these emissions. A novel standard ecolabel for radiology informatics tools, such as the Energy Star label for consumer devices or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification for buildings, should be developed to promote awareness and guide radiologists and radiology informatics leaders in making environmentally conscious decisions for their clinical practice.

The objective is to project the distribution of the carbon footprint associated with each scope: scope 1 includes emissions from transportation and LPG purchases, scope 2 includes emissions from PLN electricity consumption, and scope 3 includes emissions from the use of PDAM and food (snacks and rice papers). The International Panel on Climate Change's approach is used to calculate third-scope carbon footprints. The activities on the SV IPB campus have a carbon footprint of 369.8143 TonCO2e. Of this, scope 1 contributes 6.917 TonCO2e (LPG: 6.84 TonCO2e and transportation: 0.0774 TonCO2e), scope 2 makes up 362,584 TonCO2e, and scope 3 makes up 0.550 TonCO2e (PDAM: 0.22 TonCO2e; snacks box: 0.138 TonCO2e; rice box: 0.193 TonCO2e). Minimizing the carbon footprint of SV IPB activities is carried out by implementing leadership policies regarding increasing the habit of turning off computers when they are not in use/have finished using them, turning off the AC and lights when they are not in use/have finished using them; as well as continuing to strive for online and hybrid-based learning processes/seminars/meetings in certain periods; changing transportation activities for leaders to walking; carrying out effectiveness in Study Program meeting activities; and reforestation by planting trees and ornamental plants that can help absorb CO2.

The intricate framework of digitalization and green technologies has the potential to persuade governments to implement policies that promote a zero-carbon economy, i.e., green economy. Hence, this study determines the effect of digital trade (DGT) and green technological innovation (GTI) on environmental sustainability (ENS) by considering the role of renewable energy consumption (REC), globalization (GLOB), and economic growth (EG). The study measured ENS by taking into account three proxy variables, i.e., ecological footprint (EF), carbon dioxide emission (CO2e), and methane emissions (CH4e). POLS and PMG-ARDL techniques are applied to the panel data of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) from 2000 to 2019.

Climate change manifests through mechanisms such as extreme weather, shifting disease burden, wildfires, and drought, which all have negative implications on human health. Simultaneously, the health care sector is responsible for 4.6% of global greenhouse gas emissions. As users of some of the hospital's most energy-intensive equipment, radiology departments are key stakeholders in the transition to clean energy. The authors propose a framework to guide radiology departments to advance health care sustainability. The approach outlines how a radiology department can reduce its environmental footprint through appointing a sustainability officer, forming a dedicated green team, incorporating sustainability into the departmental strategic plan, quantifying total greenhouse gas emissions, committing to education, and advocating for systemic change. By delineating a structured path, the authors hope to encourage the transition toward environmentally friendly practices in all radiology practice settings. © 2023 American College of Radiology"

It defines specific measures, in order to improve energy efficiency in buildings and infrastructures, promote the use of renewable energy in the port area, and confer environmental benefits for the citizens of neighboring territories and port users. The main actions developed are as follows: photovoltaic solar plants and tidal energy systems, electrification of the docks to allow the shore supply of ships, and the construction of a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) storage plant to replace more polluting marine fuels, together with awareness campaigns on “green” issues, involving the 3 million users of these ports. Starting from the socio-economic and environmental analysis of the territorial context managed by AdSP, the DEASP analyses all the activities carried out inside port areas and reports the energy consumptions of the concessionaries, in the way to calculate the carbon footprint and develop an environmental sustainable strategy to reduce pollutant emissions.

Anthropogenic activities such as land fillings, building dams, wetlands converting to lands, combustion of biomass, deforestation, mining, and the gas and coal industries have directly or indirectly increased catastrophic methane (CH4) emissions at an alarming rate. Methane is 25 times more potent trapping heat when compared to carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. A rise in atmospheric methane, on a 20-year time scale, has an impact of 80 times greater than that of CO2. With increased population growth, waste generation is rising and is predicted to reach 6 Mt by 2025. CH4 emitted from landfills is a significant source that accounts for 40% of overall global methane emissions. Various mitigation and emissions reduction strategies could significantly reduce the global CH4 burden at a cost comparable to the parallel and necessary CO2 reduction measures, reversing the CH4 burden to pathways that achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. CH4 mitigation directly benefits climate change, has collateral impacts on the economy, human health, and agriculture, and considerably supports CO2 mitigation. Utilizing the CO2 from the environment, methanogens produce methane and lower their carbon footprint. NGOs and the general public should act on time to overcome atmospheric methane emissions by utilizing the raw source for producing carbon–neutral fuel. However, more research potential is required for green energy production and to consider investigating the untapped potential of methanogens for dependable energy generation. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2023."

We applied carbon footprinting methodology to Bubble-PAPR™, a novel, part-reusable and part-recyclable powered air-purifying respirator, designed at our institution. Current guidance states that disposable respirator masks can be worn for 1-h in the United Kingdom, whilst the Bubble-PAPR™ allows prolonged use. Methods: Following a detailed use-case analysis, the carbon footprint of each component was estimated using a bottom-up (attributional) cradle-to-grave process-based analysis. Modelling considered the use of virgin or closed loop recycled polyvinyl chloride for the disposable hood element, and disposal via infectious or recycling waste streams to estimate a per-use carbon footprint. Results: The per-use carbon footprint with manufacture from virgin polyvinyl chloride and disposal via incineration is 0.805 kgCO2e. With nine cycles of closed loop recycling and manufacture of the polyvinyl chloride hood (10 uses), the carbon footprint falls to an average of 0.570 kgCO2e per use. Conclusion: Carbon footprinting may contribute to the value proposition of this novel technology. We estimate that a single Bubble-PAPR™ use has a higher carbon footprint than disposable respirator mask-based PPE. However, this is mitigated in circumstances when multiple disposable mask changes are required (e.g. prolonged use) and use may be justifiable when user comfort, visualisation and communication with patients and colleagues are essential. © The Intensive Care Society 2023."

Methods: Fifteen consecutive adult tonsillectomy surgeries were prospectively randomized to one of three tonsillectomy techniques: cold, monopolar electrocautery, or low-temperature radiofrequency ablation (Coblation). Life cycle assessment was used to comprehensively evaluate the environmental impact of study surgeries. Outcomes assessed included multiple measures of environmental impact, including greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and cost. Environmental impact measures were analyzed to identify highest-yield areas for improvement, and outcomes were compared between surgical techniques using statistical analysis. Results: GHG emissions for cold, monopolar electrocautery, and Coblation techniques were 157.6, 184.5, and 204.7 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents (kgCO2-eq) per surgery, respectively, with costs totaling $472.51, $619.10, and $715.53 per surgery, respectively. Regardless of surgery technique, anesthesia medications and disposable equipment contributed most to environmental harm. Cold technique demonstrated reduced environmental impact related to disposable surgical equipment in the categories of greenhouse gas emissions, acidification of soil and water, eutrophication of air, ozone depletion, release of carcinogenic, and non-carcinogenic toxic substances, and respiratory pollutant production (p < 0.05 for all comparisons with other techniques). Conclusion: Within the boundaries of operating room processes, cold technique minimizes cost and environmental impact of adult tonsillectomy surgery, with statistical significance noted in the impact of disposable surgical equipment. Areas of highest potential for improvement identified include reducing use of disposable equipment and collaboration with the Anesthesiology care team to streamline medication use.

Geopolymer shows itself as a viable and sustainable alternative to the Portland cement binder in civil infrastructure applications, offering a low-energy, low-carbon-footprint solution. This study evaluates five models: random forest (RF), robust linear regression (RL), recurrent neural network (RNN), response surface methodology (RSM), and regression tree (RT). The RL and RT models were utilized in the prediction of GPC compressive strength (CS), employing the Matlab R19a regression learner APP. The RNN model was implemented using the Matlab R19a toolkit. Furthermore, the RF model was developed using R studio version 4.2.2 programming code, and the RSM model was constructed using the Minitab 18 toolbox. EViews 12 software was utilized for both pre-processing and post-processing of the data. Additionally, it was employed to convert the non-stationary data into stationary data to obtain accurate results. The input variables included SiO2/Na2O (S/N), Na2O (N), water/binder ratio (W/B), curing time (CT), ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV), and 28-day compressive strength (MPa) (CS) as the target variable. The findings of the study indicate that the RMS-M3 model exhibited superior performance compared to all other models, demonstrating a high level of accuracy.

The successful implementation of energy sources is intricately connected to these goals, making it imperative to coordinate efforts in the development of new technologies. However, the commitments made by the parties involved in the Paris Accord to achieve high decarbonization targets have triggered a growing debate on whether existing environmental policies are sufficient in fostering technological advancements by 2030, in order to meet these targets. This study aimed to examine the impact of economic growth, financial development, eco-friendly ICT, renewable energy, andhuman capital on lowering carbon footprint in the world's top polluting economies from 1993 to 2020. To accomplish this objective, a comprehensive investigation was conducted, employing contemporary econometric approaches such as CS-ARDL. Robust estimations of long-run effects were ensured through the utilization of AMG and CCEMG econometric techniques. Notably, a panel causality test revealed the presence of a bidirectional causality relationship between renewable energy, environmental technology, and carbon footprints. Conversely, a unidirectional causality relationship was identified between economic-growth and financial development with carbon footprints. The findings of this study indicate that eco-friendly ICT have the potential to effectively alleviate pollution. Consequently, financial development, renewable energy, and environmental technology are postulated as potential solutions for reducing carbon emissions within the examined timeframe.

Although Africa's share of global greenhouse gas (GHG) is minimal, the ensuing effects hit hard on the continent. Hence, the present study provides the first comprehensive empirical assessment of environmental sustainability in Africa within the novel STIRPAT framework. This study critically examines the impacts of natural resource dependence, renewable energy, urbanization, technological innovations, and structural transition on environmental pollution proxied by carbon emissions, ecological footprint, and PM2.5 air pollution from 1990 to 2019 in five top carbon-emitting African countries. The empirical evidence is based on advanced panel estimators comprising CS-ARDL, CCEMG, and AMG robust to cross-sectional dependence (CSD). The quantile regression efficient for exploring the conditional distribution effects is equally employed alongside Dumitrescu-Hurlin panel granger causality test. The preliminary tests reveal the presence of CSD and heterogeneity of the series, which led to the conduct of second-generation unit root and cointegration tests. The main empirical results show that renewable energy, technological innovations, and structural transition reduce environmental pollutants from surging based on the observable negative signs. By implication, these indicators support Africa's path to environmental sustainability. On the flip side, resource dependence and urbanization amplify the surge. The feedbacks from quantile regression provide sturdy support for the main estimators. The granger causality feedbacks support the existence of bidirectional and unidirectional causality among the variables. Based on the findings, policies that promote sustainable environment are formulated. © The Author(s) 2022."

Multi-tiered grow racks (MTGR) consisting of a series of horizontal grow beds stacked one atop the other is one common type of VFS. When such systems are used on rooftops or in greenhouses where free sunlight is abundant, lower platforms of MTGR are unable to tap on the available sunlight efficiently because the opaque top layers of the MTGR often block incoming sunlight from reaching the lower layers. Thus, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) at shaded regions of lower layers in MTGRs will be insufficient and nonuniform. A direct solution is to use artificial lighting at lower beds to improve PAR availability. However, this solution is not ideal, as electricity consumption due to artificial lighting can increase monetary costs and indirect carbon footprint. Here, we designed and developed light redirecting panels that can redirect sunlight from the edge of the racks, where sunlight is more accessible, toward the central regions where shading is more severe. In our study, the panels redistributed excess sunlight and improved the cumulative PAR across the central region of the lower platform by 2.6–7.2%. If common leafy greens such as Brassica rapa var. parachinensis (choy sum) and Lactuca sativa (lettuce) are grown, we predicted that our panels can improve photosynthetic activity by up to 10 and 12%, respectively. By harnessing more sunlight in the environment, the solution has the potential to improve crop yield and reduce the need for electrical lighting, lessening the impact of vertical farming on global warming. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2023."

Train neural network on the edge is challenging because there is a large gap between limited resources on edge and the resource requirement of current training methods. Existing training methods are based on the assumption that the underlying computing infrastructure has sufficient memory and energy supplies. These methods involve two copies of the model parameters, which is usually beyond the capacity of on-chip memory in processors. The data movement between off-chip and on-chip memory incurs large amounts of energy. We propose resource constrained training (RCT) to realize resource-efficient training for edge devices and servers. RCT only keeps a quantized model throughout the training so that the memory requirement for model parameters in training is reduced. It adjusts per-layer bitwidth dynamically to save energy when a model can learn effectively with lower precision. We carry out experiments with representative models and tasks in image classification, natural language processing, and crowd counting applications. Experiments show that on average, 8-15-bit weight update is sufficient for achieving SOTA performance in these applications. RCT saves 63.5%-80% memory for model parameters and saves more energy for communications. Through experiments, we observe that the common practice on the first/last layer in model compression does not apply to efficient training. Also, interestingly, the more challenging a dataset is, the lower bitwidth is required for efficient training.  © 2012 IEEE."

However, achieving SRAM with a small footprint, high flexibility, and high thermal stability has always been a big challenge. In this work, an ultraflexible six-transistor SRAM with high integration density is realized based on a monolithic three-dimensional (M3D) design. In this design, vertical stacked n-type indium gallium zinc oxide thin film transistors and p-type carbon nanotube transistors share common gate and drain electrodes, respectively, saving interlayer vias used in traditional M3D designs. This compact architecture reduces the footprint of the SRAM cell from a six-transistor to a four-transistor area, saving 33% of the area, and significantly enables the SRAM to have the highest flexibility among the reported ones, withstanding a harsh deforming process (6000 cycles of bending at a radius of 500 μm) without performance degradation. Moreover, this design facilitates the thermal stability of the SRAM under high temperature (333 K). It also exhibits great static and dynamic performance, with the highest normalized hold noise margin of 73.6%, a maximum gain of 151.2, and a minimum static power consumption of 3.15 μW in hold operation among the reported flexible SRAMs. This demonstration provides possibilities for SRAMs to be used in advanced wearable system applications. © 2024 American Chemical Society."

Several concrete mix-design methods were developed based on optimizing certain factor such as the unit weight of the concrete or the specific surface area of the aggregates. However, these available mix-design methods are limited to certain types of cement and aggregates while the construction industry today is looking for more advanced, sustainable, and ecofriendly (net-zero) materials such as blast furnace slag (BFS), fly ash (FA), and superplasticizer (SP). The aim of this study is to develop a predictive model for the compressive strength of certain net-zero concrete mixes at different ages considering the previously mentioned “towards carbon neutrality” industrial waste materials using the novel superspeed metaheuristic predictive techniques. A database of 1133 records of net-zero concrete mixes was collected from literature and studied to be used in training and testing the predictive models. The performance metrics used in this exercise are mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and R 2 score. The Automl tools were very handy as they presented the fastest models with the best performances also. The AutoSklearn models were presented for both 5 min and 10 min execution time. At the 5-min limit execution time, a performance of R 2 equals 91.8%, with MAE of 3.395% and MSE of 23.224% was achieved in 262 s (4.37 min). At the 10-min set execution time, a performance of R 2 equals 92.2%, with MAE of 3.197% and MSE of 22.224% was achieved in 597 s (9.95 min). The AutoGluon (TabularPredictor) was also deployed to model the CCS from the global database of nine features with no set time limits. This was executed in 785 s (13.08 min) and produced a model performance with R 2 of 92.6%, MAE of 2.820%, and MSE of 20.918%. Though the execution time was higher than those of AutoSklearn models set for 5- and 10-min run time limits, it produced a better performance. Finally, the SVR and the RFR were deployed to produce models for the compressive strength of the hybrid concrete, and the following performances were recorded; run time of 6081 s (101.35 min), R 2 of 86.6%, MAE of 3.901%, and MSE of 38.158% and runtime of 6442 s (107.37 min), R 2 of 90.5%, MAE of 3.404%, and MSE of 27.105%, respectively. It can be learned that excessive waiting time was used by the SVR and the RFR compared to the AutoSklearn set at 5 and 10 min and the TabularPredictor, which is known as the AutoGluon. In addition to the less time advantage exhibited by the AutoML techniques, they also produced the best performance, which also outclassed previous studies that used the ANN to produce less performance models even at higher execution times. Overall, the results showed that BFS has a major impact on the overall performance of the ecofriendly concrete strength and it is a good sustainable and ecofriendly replacement for cement than FA. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Based on safety requirements, hospitals and related services use an extensive number of consumables, most of which end up incinerated at the end of their life cycle. A thorough assessment of the carbon footprint of such devices typically requires knowing precise information about the manufacturing process, which is rarely available in detail because of the many materials, pieces, and steps involved during the fabrication. Yet, the tools most often used for determining the environmental impact of consumer goods require a bunch of parameters, mainly based on the material composition of the device. Here, we report a basic set of analytical methods that provide the information required by the software OpenLCA to calculate the main outcome related to environmental impact, greenhouse gas emissions. Through thermogravimetry, calorimetry, infrared spectroscopy, and elemental analysis, we proved that obtaining relevant data for the calculator in the exemplifying case of endoscopy tooling or accessories is possible.

408,Examining the interactions among smart supply chains and carbon reduction strategies: To attain carbon neutrality,Article,Patil A.; Shardeo V.; Dwivedi A.; Moktadir M.A.; Bag S.,Business Strategy and the Environment,33.0,2024,1227,1246,10.1002/bse.3547,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85169083904&doi=10.1002%2fbse.3547&partnerID=40&md5=d17daa7d410bfa672fc9fecceab03e5c,09644733,Scopus,carbon neutrality; carbon reduction; Industry 4.0; smart supply chain; strategies; sustainability,"Rapid industrialization and global supply chains have magnified industrial activities' carbon footprint, resulting in environmental hazards. Several countries have magnified their efforts to reach carbon neutrality goals. The increased attention to carbon-neutral goals has been enabled by United Nations (UN) calls for a carbon-neutral economy. In this context, supply chains will have greater responsibilities to reduce the network's carbon footprint. To achieve carbon neutrality goals, decision-makers must be well-informed and facilitated with suitable theoretical frameworks. In literature, the adoption of intelligent technologies is suggested to construct efficient and smart supply chains. However, there are uncertainties regarding the impact of this transformation on the carbon neutrality goal. The present study caters to the uncertainties by discussing its potential impact on carbon neutrality goals and how to use adopted technologies to achieve the same. A list of 11 potential strategies is identified and modelled to provide a strategic roadmap for smart supply chains' adoption. The proposed framework aims to facilitate carbon neutrality goals. The findings indicate that decision-makers must pay significant attention to circular economy practices. Additionally, green transportation is an impactful area with significant potential to support carbon neutrality goals. Critical insights have been extracted regarding stakeholders' training and process innovation. The study findings can help decision-makers achieve carbon neutrality goals. © 2023 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
409,Assessing the Technical Routes for Chemical Cycling of Waste Plastics to Light Olefins,Article,Liang J.; Liu D.; Xu S.; Ye M.,ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering,12.0,2024,970,985,10.1021/acssuschemeng.3c06252,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85180122524&doi=10.1021%2facssuschemeng.3c06252&partnerID=40&md5=438a8317ae3b47cdd3fe04fca1e4ea20,21680485,Scopus,carbon footprint; chemical cycling; light olefins; techno-economics; waste plastics,"Waste plastics have become the second biggest environmental concern following climate change. The method for chemical cycling of waste plastics into light olefins is proposed. Four potential technical routes, that is, plastics to light olefins via syngas through the Fischer-Tropsch process (PFTO), plastics to light olefins via syngas through the recently developed OX-ZEO process (PZTO), plastics to light olefins via methanol through the methanol-to-olefins process (PMTO), and plastics to light olefins via pyrolysis oil and gas through hydrocracking and steam cracking process (PPTO), were studied. The carbon footprint, energy efficiency, and economic performance were analyzed based on techno-economic evaluation and life cycle assessment. The results demonstrated that the overall carbon efficiency of the PFTO, PZTO, PMTO, and PPTO routes was about 26.61, 67.59, 95.49, and 47.81%, respectively. The PMTO route had the highest carbon efficiency of the four routes. The energy efficiency and CO2 emissions of PMTO were 55.60% and 0.55 t CO2/t olefin, respectively, better than the rest three routes with PFTO of 29.35% and 3.48 t CO2/t olefin, PZTO of 47.55% and 1.21 t CO2/t olefin, and PPTO of 47.21% and 0.69 t CO2/t olefin. Production costs decreased as the carbon efficiency increased. The product costs of the PFTO, PZTO, PMTO, and PPTO routes were about 6003.36, 5400.23, 4918.59, and 6763.13 Chinese Yuan (CNY)/t olefin, respectively, which were calculated according to the price system of raw materials and products. In summary, PMTO is the most promising route with superior performance in CO2 emissions, energy efficiency, and economics. As methanol-to-olefins (MTO) have already been commercialized, PMTO might provide a potential approach for large-scale cycling of waste plastics in the near future. © 2023 American Chemical Society."

Biogas is a promising option to substitute natural gas, but adequate purification of the produced biogas is necessary (the CO2 content of raw biogas must be reduced). Membrane technologies have proven its technical viability to purify biogas until the defined requirements. Moreover, membranes based on biopolymers could reduce the environmental footprint of these purification processes. Nevertheless, due to the trade-off between purity and recovery, single-stage processes are not able to attain desired targets, so multiple stages are required to reach the desired high purities and recoveries. The aim of this study is to advance the use of biopolymer-based membranes for the separation of CO2/CH4 and evaluate the economic competitiveness of the designed multistage purification process. For this purpose, a chitosan composite membrane with organic (ionic liquid) and inorganic (titanosilicate) fillers in the selective layer was used to study the multistage configuration, considering CO2 and CH4 as both target products. The process configuration is based on three membrane units operating in series to enrich CO2 in the product stream from the permeate line, while the retentates are collected from each stage and mixed to obtain a CH4-rich stream in the retentate. The target objectives were purities and recoveries of ≥95% of CO2 in the permeate outlet and ≥97% of CH4 in the retentate outlet stream of the multistage process. The economic evaluation of the proposed three-stage separation process was performed for different process scales, from small installations to large plants (100-1000 N m3 h-1 feed flow rate basis), operated with two different pressure ratios (8 and 16). Total specific costs and contributions of the different cost terms to fixed and operating costs were estimated. Operating costs were the largest contributor to total costs in all of the scenarios studied. To highlight the total specific costs for the installations of 1000 N m3 h-1 capacity, the obtained total costs were 0.33 and 0.20 US $ N m3- for the 8 and 16 pressure ratio values, respectively. This latter cost was competitive when compared to the cost published in the literature. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of increased specific costs of materials (membrane cost) and energy (electricity cost) on the total specific costs of the three-stage separation process. © 2024 American Chemical Society."

Additionally, the lifecycle analysis (LCA) compares the effects of use of nanofluid in the chemical processing industry to increase the effectiveness of the heat transfer to the typical STHE system. Nanofluids increase heat transfer, as evidenced by the results of the experiments. The Nusselt number and pressure drop were both increased by roughly 65% and 8%, respectively, using 0.5 vol% of TiO2-SiC/water hybrid nanofluid compared to water as coolant. The ecological impact of STHE was estimated as s attribute of Ecological (EF) and total cost estimation function using artificial neural networks (ANN). Finally, the IdematLightLCA (2.8.6 version) software was used to calculate energy content, Carbon footprint, and cost over the lifespan of the baseline. The results show that nanofluid-based STHE has an average payback period considerably longer than typical coolant systems but saves superior economic value at the end of its lifetime. According to the findings, the suggested novel method is both cost-effective and environmentally feasible. © IMechE 2022."

This research assessed the mitigation potential of SPS on the carbon footprint (CFP) neutralizing in one integrated livestock farm of cow-calf and pig production system in the Colombian Amazon. Annual carbon accumulation rate (ACAR) in MgCO2e ha−1y−1, was evaluated on living above-ground biomass including trees and shrubs > 2 cm DBH and pasture, and leaf litter and below-ground biomass including coarse and fine roots, soil organic carbon 0–10 cm deep, and total ACAR adding up all components in live fences (LF), scattered trees (ST), fallows (FW), fodder bank (FB) and pastures (PT). The GHG emissions in MgCO2e ha−1y−1 were accounted in CO2 from liming, urea, fuel, electricity, and supplementation, CH4 from enteric methane, manure, and organic fertilization and N2O from urine and manure. The C balance was obtained from the differences between ACAR of SPS on farm and the CFP per surface. Mean total ACAR expressed in MgC ha−1y−1 were 9.0 ± 4.6 in FW, 7.0 ± 1.2 in LF, 5.5 ± 0.8 in ST, 4.2 ± 0.2 in FB and 2.9 ± 0.1 in PT. Mean CFP was 3.7 MgCO2e ha−1y−1, 5.3 MgCO2e Live Weight ha−1y−1, and 23.6 MgCO2e Live Weight Gain y−1. The CFP (area) can be neutralized with total ACAR value of 2.1 ha−1 for LF, 1.6 ha−1 for FW, 2.6 ha−1 for ST, 3.5 ha−1 for FB and 5.1 ha−1 for PT. The Silvopastoral systems have a higher potential for neutralizing GHG emissions than pasture-based scenario when considering the ACAR in above-ground biomass. © 2023, The Author(s)."

Life cycle analysis constitutes a valuable tool determining the primary factors that increase carbon footprint and other important environmental indicators, under the prism of developing methods to reduce the environmental impact of the farms. The purpose of this study was to measure and evaluate the carbon footprint of raw milk production of sheep farming in Western Macedonia, Greece, for the first time, along with the environmental performance of the farming systems. Methods: To achieve this goal, data on inputs and outputs were collected from 10 semi-intensive and 3 intensive farming systems of the Regional Units of Florina and Kozani. Data were collected using specifically configured questionnaires, which included questions concerning the amounts of fossil fuels, water, feed, electricity used in a year, as well as farm demographics and outputs. Life cycle analysis was carried out using the SimaPro 9.4.0.2 software. Results: According to the results, the average carbon footprint of semi-intensive dairy sheep farming in Western Macedonia was 3.41 kg of CO2-eq/kg of fat- and protein-corrected milk, while the corresponding value for intensive sheep farming was 3.58 kg of CO2-eq/kg of fat- and protein-corrected milk. The results also indicate that in intensive systems, higher milk production is not consistent with a larger environmental footprint compared to semi-intensive farming systems. The use of soybean and maize for animal feed, along with emissions from enteric fermentation, is the main hotspots in milk production process. Conclusions: The above findings can contribute to drawing conclusions concerning the management of the production hotspots, in an attempt to reduce the carbon footprint of the farms and propose a more sustainable plan for rearing animals. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

The improper disposal of these items poses a serious environmental threat. The present study explores the potential of recycling PPE to not only enhance the profitability of the supply chain but also address the environmental challenges associated with disposal. Specifically, it focuses on implementing a closed-loop approach involving the manufacturer, the customer, and the collector. An extensive literature review on inventory models was conducted, resulting in a comprehensive data set. The numerical analysis, conducted using the Generalized Reduced Gradient Solver, validates the findings. The proposed model suggests that investing in a closed-loop supply chain, employing an energy-efficient approach, can effectively reduce carbon emissions at every stage of the system. This can be achieved by leveraging intelligent machinery and skilled labor to meet the growing demand for PPE while minimizing energy consumption. Furthermore, this research emphasizes the importance of implementing the reduce, reuse, and recycle (3Rs) phenomenon to manage waste effectively.

This study aimed to quantify hospital food waste and its nutritional, environmental and financial values in medical and surgical wards. In a cross-sectional study in three educational hospitals, nutritional and demographic data of adult inpatients were collected. The food waste was measured at breakfast, lunch and snack times, and a 24-hour food recall was fulfilled for each patient. Also, the nutritional, environmental and financial values of discarded food were calculated. Food waste contributors were determined using linear regression. Totally, 398 meals were evaluated. The average served food was about 1 kg patient−1 day−1, while 539.5 g patient−1 day−1(50.1% of the served food) was discarded. Mean food wastes were 148.9 g (standard deviation (SD): 130.1), 364.3 g (SD: 257.2) and 80.2 g (SD: 101.5) in breakfast, lunch and snacks, equal to 45.7% (SD: 36.9), 51.4% (SD: 36.1) and 62.4% (SD: 53.2) of the served food, respectively. Rice, soup, milk and fruits were mostly discarded. Severely malnourished patients had higher daily food waste. Food preparation and waste were estimated to cost on average US$1.8 and US$0.8 patient−1 day−1, respectively. Each kilogram of food waste resulted in 8.1 m2 of land use, 1.4 kg of CO2-equivalent gas emission, and about 1003 L of water wastage. Half of the hospital food was discarded which means waste of nutrients, environmental resources and money.

However, most pretreatments are studied and optimized as single-step schemes, focusing on maximizing a side stream. Sequential pretreatments have been shown to improve the selective isolation of platforms for further valorization. However, pretreatment performance can consider not only technical but also economic, environmental, and social concerns. This work assessed the sustainability of sequential pretreatments in rice husk-based biorefineries. RESULTS: Four biorefinery scenarios were designed, simulated, and assessed considering dilute acid and wet air oxidation pretreatment technologies in sequential and single-step schemes. Economic feasibility was demonstrated for sequential pretreatments when phenolic compounds are contemplated, generating gross incomes of 4.76 M-USD yr−1. From an environmental perspective, the rice supply chain generated a carbon footprint of 2.17 kg CO2 eq kg−1 of rice husks, where the producer link is the largest contributor due to fertilizer use. Likewise, it was shown that supplying energy demands using black liquor as fuel relieves operating costs and reduces the carbon footprint. The social dimension showed that between 69 and 77 jobs could be generated annually along the value chain and the biorefinery schemes. However, biorefineries have a high risk due to the high volume of cooling water. CONCLUSIONS: All dimensions were weighted to calculate a sustainability index, where it was concluded that sequential pretreatment biorefineries improved sustainability against the single-step schemes. However, the scenario of valorization of the three fractions (Sc1) is the best scheme to be implemented as it has always demonstrated economic feasibility. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI). © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI)."

However, our understanding of how to decarbonize building construction remains limited. This study shows that net-zero embodied carbon in buildings is achievable across Japan by 2050 using currently available technologies: decarbonized electricity supply, low-carbon steel, low-carbon concrete, increased timber structures, optimized design, and enhanced building lifespan. The largest emissions savings would come from increased use of timber structures, with annual savings of up to ∼35% by 2050, even in cases where timber replaces low-carbon steel and concrete. Moreover, we show that an expanded domestic timber supply, coupled with responsible reforestation, could improve forest carbon uptake by up to ∼60% compared to the business-as-usual scenario, without the need to increase forest area. This is achieved through a forest-city carbon cycle that transfers carbon stocks of mature trees to cities as building materials and rejuvenates forests through reforestation. Collectively, our analysis demonstrates that the decarbonization of building construction depends not on future technological innovation, but rather on how we design and use buildings with the options we already have. © 2024 The Authors.

In the recent years, a variety of functional units (FUs) have been applied to the comparative LCAs of product systems, but a persistent methodological challenge of applying FUs is still posed, especially in food systems. Responding to the research question of which FU is appropriate for proper environmental benchmarking, this present study revisits mass, economic value, and multiple (caloric value, protein, carbohydrate, fibre, saturated fat, minerals, vitamins) quality-based 12 FUs in food LCAs. Carbon footprints of 20 food products, expressed as Global Warming Potential 100, are calculated by openLCA 1.10.3 software, which are considered in the correlation test between the indicators per FUs using the statistical analysis, R 3.6.1. The results indicate that although the mass-based FUs (on dry/wet basis) do not reflect the actual function of food products, the FUs might be applied to the environmental benchmarking since both the FUs have a good correlation with others (R = 0.7–0.9) and vice versa, especially with the economic value-based FU to be integrated quantity & quality into a single FU. The results also reveal that it could be inappropriate to define a quality-based FU using all of macro & micro nutrients and minerals (R = 0.1–0.5), and the multiple quality-based FUs might not be appropriate for the environmental benchmarking. The comprehensive investigation of FUs for food LCAs could provide valuable insights into environmental benchmarking suitability. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Iranian Society of Environmentalists (IRSEN) and Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University."

Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a promising thermochemical conversion technology to handle wet feedstocks and convert them to valuable bio-crude, bio-char and aqueous products. This study highlights the advantages of using glycerol as the co-solvent along with water in different proportions to produce bio-crude from RDF via HTL. The ratio of water:glycerol (vol.%:vol.%) was varied for each experiment (100:0, 90:10, 80:20, 70:30, 60:40, 50:50), and the product yields and their quality were studied. The results demonstrate that increasing the proportion of glycerol until 50 vol.% in the solvent enhances the bio-crude yield (36.2 wt.%) and its higher heating value (HHV) (30.9 MJ kg−1). Deoxygenation achieved in the bio-crude was 42%. The production of bio-char was minimum (9.5 wt.%) at 50 vol.% glycerol with HHV of 31.9 MJ kg−1. The selectivity to phenolic compounds in the bio-crude increased, while that of cyclic oxygenates decreased when the glycerol content was more than 20 vol.%. The gas-phase analysis revealed that the major deoxygenation pathway was decarboxylation. The yield of aqueous products drastically increased with the addition of glycerol. The minimum amount of glycerol in the co-solvent that favours an energetically feasible process with low carbon footprint is 30 vol.%. Using 50 vol.% glycerol resulted in the highest energy recovery in the bio-crude and bio-char (80%), the lowest energy consumption ratio (0.43) and lowest environmental factor (0.1). The mass-based process mass intensity factor, calculated based on only bio-crude and bio-char as the valuable products, decreased with an increase in addition of glycerol, while it was close to unity when the aqueous phase is also considered as a valuable product. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

This investigation offers new knowledge of how a CEO's regulatory focus can shape whether firms reduce their carbon footprints. Building on regulatory focus theory, this study proposes how the two distinct motivational dispositions (i.e., promotion or prevention focus) of a CEO relate to corporate carbon emissions. We empirically analyzed S&P 500 firms from 2007 to 2018. The findings indicate that CEOs with a high promotion focus are positively associated with corporate carbon emissions, whereas CEOs with a high prevention focus are negatively linked to corporate carbon emissions, with the latter relationship weakened by industry volatility.

The best method to utilize these wastes is to make different types of building materials and include them in structural parts, reducing the carbon footprint. In developing countries such as India, the population explosion raises the need for sustainable construction materials to fulfill the country's excessive consumption. Ambient temperature and elevated temperature-cured fly ash-based geopolymer bricks solve such kind of problems in a less polluting and sustainable manner than other technologies. Nowadays, geopolymerization methods and their applications for making bricks are limited only to laboratory-scale studies, and mass-scale production for making fly ash-based geopolymer bricks has rarely been examined. Therefore, this study is an attempt made by authors to overcome these issues. In the presented study, fly ash/sand-based geopolymer bricks were manufactured incorporating sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide with different molarity of NaOH (8, 12, and 16 M) at an industrial scale and tested for their mechanical properties as well as durability. The fly ash/sand-based geopolymer bricks attained up to 15 MPa compressive strength at 50% fly ash and 50% sand. Optimized samples were tested for durability-related properties, and results exhibit a more durable nature compared to burnt clay bricks and cement-based fly ash bricks. Thus, the development of fly ash-based geopolymer bricks is an energy-efficient and cleaner way to utilize fly ash.

This study presents an integrated approach utilizing electrokinetic separation processes, specifically electrodialysis (ED) and electrodialysis with bipolar membranes (BMED), for on-site water reclamation and the circular regeneration of acid and base chemicals. Comprehensive treatment tests were performed on the actual effluent from the rPET process. Various performance indicators, including water reclamation efficiency, acid and base production, current efficiency, electricity consumption, and productivity, were systematically investigated. The results revealed that BMED, despite having higher energy consumption compared to ED, could recover 63.5 ± 8.8% of sulfate and 75.8 ± 7.3% of sodium from the wastewater. It produced sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide solutions that could be reused in the process. Economic analysis demonstrated that integrating BMED into the rPET process resulted in lower operating costs (at least 10%) compared with traditional procedures, such as reverse osmosis and ED. Implementing BMED instead of direct effluent discharge in the rPET industry can significantly reduce the water footprint by 10-fold. Additionally, the carbon footprint can be further reduced by 5-17% with BMED deployment in the rPET industry. In conclusion, the integration of BMED has proven to be technically feasible and cost-effective for mitigating the environmental impact of rPET production. By recovering water and chemicals and achieving zero liquid discharge, this approach contributes to the sustainable production of rPET products. © 2024 The Authors.

However, knowledge gaps exist regarding the design of these binders. Ground-granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) has been widely used as a substitute for PC; however, it requires an alkaline activator (e.g. lime and PC) to promote pozzolanic reaction and strength enhancement. A candidate that presents a less energy-intensive manufacturing and carbon footprint is carbide lime (CL), a by-product of acetylene gas production, rich in Ca(OH)2. The main problem with the pozzolanic binder in the stabilization technique is its slow reaction kinetics and the long time required for laboratory-scale investigations before in situ application. Therefore, this research presents a dosing study of a ternary binder (TB) comprising CL, GGBS and PC type III (CEM-III) to mass-stabilize a clayey organic soil using thermal curing as an innovative technique to improve the feasibility of laboratory-scale investigations. The effects of binder composition and thermal curing time on the evolution of strength, stiffness, mineralogy, and microstructure were determined. The results, supported by a statistical analysis (ANOVA) and by a multivariate regression analysis (MRA), have shown that the new TB produced a superior mechanical response to soil samples stabilized exclusively with CEM-III. This was evidenced by a less porous microstructure (more reaction products) and mainly the formation of a C–A–S–H gel, as a product of CEM-III hydration and alkaline activation of GGBS (blended cement), whereby the CL content played a key role for the development of the long-term pozzolanic reaction. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2023."

One way of lowering energy usage is to implement scheduling strategies that distribute tasks to specified resources, which influence the processing time and power usage. Among the primary objectives to be achieved in cloud computing, power and energy consumption of the cloud environment have become issues due to ecological and economic reasons. Despite the existence of research efforts from the past pertaining to the same topic, an ideal solution to this problem has not yet been found. One of the main drawbacks of utilizing cloud computing is that the cloud data centers hosting cloud computing applications use higher volumes of energy, adding to the increased functioning cost and carbon footprint in the environment, which in turn increases the need for energy-efficient systems. In this research work, a hybrid optimization algorithm is presented, which is intended to minimize energy in the cloud computing environment. Thus, the crow search algorithm (CSA) and the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) are combined to obtain the proposed hybrid model. The hybrid approach achieves the optimal position in the shortest period of time and with the least amount of energy, load, and makespan, hence improving system performance. The experiments were conducted using three setups with different task sizes. The analysis while using the task size = 300 shows that the proposed method improved QoS, Resource Utilization (RU) and decreased makespan, energy usage, and load at a rate of 0.5073, 4.4035, 0.0331, and 0.0014, respectively. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2022."

They aim to provide small coastal hospitals with specialist services, such as endoscopies (SCEEs), by deploying specialist personnel, surgeons, and the necessary equipment to the hospital temporarily. The purpose of this program is to increase accessibility for patients, while simultaneously reducing the costs associated with patient transport to the central hospital. Methods: This retrospective pilot review of medical records identified quality indicators, such as bowel cleansing (BP), cecal intubation rate (CIR), and adenoma and advanced adenoma detection rates (ADR, AADR), to investigate the status and establish a system for quality monitoring of SCEsE in Greenland. Results: During two SCEs (8 working days), 89 SCEE were performed at Qaqortoq and Sisimiut Hospitals. The 60 patients who underwent colonoscopy included 32 men and 28 women with a mean age of 61 years (range 24–80 years). The unadjusted CIR was 91.7%. In eight (13.3%) examinations, bowel preparation was rated as unsatisfactory, resulting in two incomplete procedures. The ADR and AADR were 35% and 11.7%, respectively, and one cancer was detected (1.7%). Conclusion: The results showed satisfactory ADR, AADR, and CIR levels. However, the review also highlighted the need for increased attention to BP by developing a new procedure that considers differences due to specific eating habits in Greenland and provides much better information for patients. The review provided a snapshot of the quality of colonoscopies in Greenland, highlighting the necessity to continue this process to ensure that the quality is up to standard. Furthermore, SCE helps reduce the environmental footprint of gastrointestinal endoscopy by avoiding the need for patient air transport; instead of 77 round trips (61,830 km), only 8 (6440 km) were required. © 2023, The Author(s)."

An important design principle should be minimizing the product's weight and movement efficiency while minimizing its life cycle carbon emissions. This paper proposed a product kinematic analysis based on carbon footprint. After that, it developed a flexible picking actuator for tomato fruit based on the Bricard mechanism. Through kinematic analysis of the picking actuator, the optimized design of the mechanism is followed by simulation tests to reduce the carbon footprint over its life cycle. A systematic carbon footprint calculation model for the Bricard mechanism-based picking actuator is also developed and applied in the product design process to verify the design mechanism's feasibility, method and technology.

High-value added products from riceberry are being promoted targeting health-conscious consumers. To provide supporting information for sustainable food systems, environmental footprinting was applied for evaluating the environmental performance of a ready-to-eat product of riceberry rice mixed with kidney red bean called “Riceberry + KU”, developed by Kasetsart University in Thailand. Based on sold unit as the unit of analysis, the carbon footprint of Riceberry + KU was 5.24 gCO2e per 300 g. Interestingly, white rice had the highest carbon footprint and riceberry rice as well as the riceberry product had at least 30% lower values. However, using nutrient-based scores, although white rice still had the highest carbon footprint, Riceberry + KU had 80% lower and the riceberry rice had 65% lower values. This resulted from the highest nutritional levels found in Riceberry + KU along with the lower greenhouse gas emissions from riceberry field during the cultivation stage. Similar trends were found in the other impact categories assessed by using life cycle assessment as well. To provide appropriate information to consumers for making more sustainable food choices, the environmental performance based on nutrient quality resulting from different farming systems and processing methods should be used to derive recommendations for moving toward sustainable food systems. The nutrition-environment nexus assessment could be very useful for supporting consumers toward making more sustainable food choices. © The Author(s) 2023."

It is crucial to explore the decarbonization pathways of the copper industry to help fulfill greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction targets. This study utilized material flow analysis and life cycle assessment methods to investigate 12 different subscenarios based on international trade, circular economy, technology evolution, and environmental market factors. Policy combination scenario is employed to reveal the mechanism of decarbonization. The results show that refined copper consumption in China is expected to increase by 62.3% in 2060 compared to 2020. The GHG emissions of China’s copper industry will reach 9.1 million tonnes (Mt) CO2e in 2060, technology evolution and environmental market are crucial for realizing carbon neutrality goal of this industry, accounting for 26.4 and 47.2% of emissions reductions, respectively, between 2020 and 2060. International trade and circular economy play important roles in the high-quality carbon peaking stage; however, imported copper and domestic secondary copper will constitute the basic supply of copper resources in China in the long run, and the comparative advantages of them will gradually weaken. Policy combination scenario can achieve the incentive synergy effect, with GHG reduced to 0.5 Mt CO2e in 2060. The enhanced application of policies such as material substitution and carbon emission trading will further promote industry to achieve net-zero GHG emission. We suggest regulating the industry’s structure based on the international systemic circulation pattern and accelerating the construction of a green circular chain in the short term to achieve sustainable copper supply and high-quality carbon peaking. Promoting a high-quality technology development strategy and enhancing the environmental markets are recommended in the long term to achieve carbon neutrality. © 2023 American Chemical Society."

The purpose of this study is to develop a design procedure for intermediate-depth TLDs with horizontal baffles that would produce significantly enhanced damping. Methods: For its influence on the liquid sloshing frequency, horizontal baffles are normally overlooked while choosing means to enhance the performance of TLDs. However, when the baffles’ width is kept within one-tenth of the damper length, the effect of the baffles on the sloshing frequency becomes insignificant. In the present study, maintaining this condition, horizontal baffles are designed. Mathematical modeling of the damper and the structure-damper system are described. A systematic design procedure for the intermediate-depth TLD with horizontal baffles is presented. Result: The effectiveness of the damper is illustrated by considering seismically excited example buildings. The performances of TLD with and without horizontal baffles are compared. A conventional design of the structures, without the damper, and by enhancing the stiffness of the structural elements with enhanced cross-section to limit the lateral structural responses are also presented. From this, the carbon footprint of the construction materials saved due to the utilization of the damper is estimated. Conclusions: The horizontal baffles improve the effectiveness of the intermediate-depth TLD manifold and make it significant for a passive device. The performances of intermediate-depth TLD with horizontal baffles and with slat screens are comparable. Further, utilization of the damper reduces about one-fifth of the carbon footprint of the example building. © Krishtel eMaging Solutions Private Limited 2023."

In view of the difficulty of collecting detailed trip trajectory data, this paper first reconstructs the trip paths via an improved modal choice model and a modified path planning model based on the O-D trip matrix, taking seven single traffic modals and two combined modals into account. In order to estimate the carbon footprints with theoretical accuracy, the bottom-up method is adopted considering the trip modal, vehicle type, power source, vehicle occupancy, operation characteristics and traffic conditions. Meanwhile, faced with the converted carbon emissions from electric vehicles, factors like charging efficiency, vehicular load, regional power structure and transmission loss are further considered in the estimation function. A case study of Changzhou City has been performed to verify the feasibility of the proposed models, where the volume distribution of commuting trips is predicted upon a modified network traffic assignment by TransCAD, and the spatial distribution of carbon emission intensity has further expanded to the adjacent areas via ArcMap analysis tools. The total carbon emission and the average link emission intensity of daily commuting in the study area are about 14.7 × 105 kg/day and 870 kg/km respectively. The discussion results indicate that the CO2 emission of fuel-driven vehicles accounts for over 86%, and the equivalent carbon emission of electric vehicles accounts for about 14% under given modal choices. The correlations of carbon emissions to road levels and zone attributes get further revealed and discussed based on the estimation results. © The Author(s) 2023."

Plasma power, inlet flow rate, temperature, CO2/CH4 ratio, and steam concentration were tuned to maximize a variety of process- and sustainability-based metrics. Analysis of the optimal conditions (with respect to different metrics) with and without the catalyst reveals that dry reforming is driven largely via noncatalytic reactions, while steam reforming and water gas shift reactions require the catalyst. The experimental outcome demonstrated that under optimum reaction conditions using the La0.7Ce0.3NiO3 catalyst it is possible to minimize global warming potential (GWP), in terms of inferred CO2 footprint normalized to hydrogen throughput, resulting in maximizing hydrogen yield through steam reforming (and water gas shift reactions) at an SEI of ≈12 eV/molecule. Furthermore, the highest CH4 conversion reached was 87% while the catalyst showed good activity stability in DBD plasma experiments.The actively learned iterative optimization procedure developed in this work allows for a direct juxtaposition of thermal (heat needed to make steam and heat the plasma reactor) and electrical (power requirement for plasma generation) carbon footprints in a highly nonlinear multivariate process. Furthermore, the corresponding GWP was calculated using a conventional electricity mix, wind electricity, and solar electricity, allowing a direct sustainability assessment in catalyst-assisted plasma conversion of carbonaceous feedstock to H2 and CO. © 2023 The Authors.

The solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) is one of the several technologies for this purpose. They are alternatives to the traditional hydrogen production from fossil fuels to enhance global energy decarbonization. However, in the bid for sustainability and a green economy, these technologies are not free from causing some environmental burdens. Using life cycle assessment (LCA), the greenhouse gas emission and degree of environmental impacts by these technologies can be identified and measured throughout their lifespan. This study addresses how to quantify these CO2 emission impacts for an electrolytic system with different energy sources. The LCA of a novel integrated hydrogen production SOEC system with energy from solar photovoltaic and bituminous powerplant is performed using simaPro, the leading global LCA solution software. Measuring the environmental impact of the electrolytic operation in terms of weight, the bituminous powerplant poses damage which is, on average 700% more than solar PV. The thermal-to-hydrogen efficiency of the SOEC system is 56%, and a probable 28% reduction in carbon footprint with heat integration.

435,Technoeconomics and carbon footprint of hydrogen production,Article,Rojas J.; Zhai S.; Sun E.; Haribal V.; Marin-Quiros S.; Sarkar A.; Gupta R.; Cargnello M.; Chueh W.; Majumdar A.,International Journal of Hydrogen Energy,49.0,2024,59,74,10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.06.292,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164737687&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijhydene.2023.06.292&partnerID=40&md5=e2ce797b696c5ee0e2ca673b2b19aa41,03603199,Scopus,Electrolysis; Hydrogen; Pyrolysis; Technoeconomics; Thermochemical looping,"Decarbonization of the global economy needs not only carbon-free electricity but also a fuel that is free of greenhouse gas emissions. Hydrogen is a prime candidate, with colors such as gray, blue and green production methods receiving attention. Generally missing from this discourse, however, is a quantitative comparison on the cost, scale, carbon footprint and infrastructure requirements for each of these technologies. Here we present a detailed technoeconomic comparison of five hydrogen production technologies: thermochemical water splitting, methane pyrolysis, water electrolysis, steam methane reforming, and chemical looping hydrogen production. Steam or autothermal methane reforming with carbon capture (SMR + CC) at large scale sets the benchmark for costs, but at small scales, electrochemical technologies appear more suitable. Potentially competitive with and sometimes more affordable than SMR + CC are chemical looping hydrogen production and methane pyrolysis. The impacts of the CO2 footprint of the electricity grid and a price on CO2 are also quantitatively evaluated. A qualitative consideration of the ability to leverage existing infrastructure is also offered with a view towards rapid scalability. Finally, the key research needs are identified for each technology. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC"
436,Smaller Aerobic Granules Significantly Reduce N2O Production by Ammonia-Oxidizing Bacteria: Evidences from Biochemical and Isotopic Analyses,Article,Liu Y.; Liu Y.; Zhao T.; He Y.; Zhu T.; Chai H.; Peng L.,Environmental Science and Technology,58.0,2024,545,556,10.1021/acs.est.3c06246,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85180947870&doi=10.1021%2facs.est.3c06246&partnerID=40&md5=b4d86be764f689e6a9fb4c4fbb6160b7,0013936X,Scopus,aerobic granular sludge (AGS); ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB); granule size; nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O); pathways; site preference,"The mitigation of nitrous oxide (N2O) is of primary significance to offset carbon footprints in aerobic granular sludge (AGS) systems. However, a significant knowledge gap still exists regarding the N2O production mechanism and its pathway contribution. To address this issue, the impact of varying granule sizes, dissolved oxygen (DO), and nitrite (NO2-) levels on N2O production by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) during nitrification in AGS systems was comprehensively investigated. Biochemical and isotopic experiments revealed that increasing DO or decreasing NO2- levels reduced N2O emission factors (by 13.8 or 19.5%) and production rates (by 0.08 or 0.35 mg/g VSS/h) via weakening the role of the AOB denitrification pathway since increasing DO competed for more electrons required for AOB denitrification. Smaller granules (0.5 mm) preferred to diminish N2O production via enhancing the role of NH2OH pathway (i.e., 59.4-100% in the absence of NO2-), while larger granules (2.0 mm) induced conspicuously higher N2O production via the AOB denitrification pathway (approximately 100% at higher NO2- levels). Nitrifying AGS systems with a unified size of 0.5 mm achieved 42% N2O footprint reduction compared with the system with mixed sizes (0.5-2.0 mm) under optimal conditions (DO = 3.0 mg-O2/L and NO2- = 0 mg-N/L). © 2023 American Chemical Society."

Using atmospheric continuous measurements of air quality and carbon dioxide (CO2), we developed a gradient-descent optimization system to estimate emissions of the city of Paris. We evaluated our joint CO2-CO-NOx optimization over the first SARS-CoV-2 related lockdown period, resulting in a decrease in emissions by 40% for NOx and 30% for CO2, in agreement with preliminary estimates using bottom-up activity data yet lower than the decrease estimates from Bayesian atmospheric inversions (50%). Before evaluating the model, we first provide an in-depth analysis of three emission data sets. A general agreement in the totals is observed over the region surrounding Paris (known as Île-de-France) since all the data sets are constrained by the reported national and regional totals. However, the data sets show disagreements in their sector distributions as well as in the interspecies ratios. The seasonality also shows disagreements among emission products related to nonindustrial stationary combustion (residential and tertiary combustion). The results presented in this paper show that a multispecies approach has the potential to provide sectoral information to monitor CO2 emissions over urban areas enabled by the deployment of collocated atmospheric greenhouse gases and air quality monitoring stations. © 2023 American Chemical Society"

As the human development index is directly related to per capita energy consumption, sustainable energy production with reduced carbon footprint is the essential pathway for cleaner environment. Over numerous existing biological processes, hydrogen production via photo fermentation and photolysis of water is considered a more sustainable and economical method of hydrogen production. While both biological modes suffer from certain limitations, such as low yields and low production rates, practical implementation is still a long way off due to these limitations. The unique properties of nanomaterials (NMs) can help increase the efficiency of the biomass to biohydrogen process in significant ways. Applications of organic and inorganic nanoparticles in photocatalytic and photo fermentative hydrogen production is discussed in this paper. This review reports a wide range of applications of nanomaterials including the details of photo fermentative microorganisms and their mechanism of action. The maximum photo fermentative bio-H2 production was reported in the presence of SiC–Fe3O4(3.02 mol H2/mol acetate), Ni (41 mol H2/mol sugar), graphite-C3N4 (64.2 mol H2/mol sugar) whereas photocatalytic bio-H2 yield was highest when Pd–Ni/CdS (54 mmol/g.h), Ni-MO/g-C3N4 (1785 mmol/g.h) and CuO/TiO2 (20.3 mmol/g.h) nanoparticles were employed. To design photocatalytic systems for practical and scalable use, the future research should be focused on deeper theoretical knowledge of mechanisms of light harvesting, ± charge separation and transport, surface biochemical reactions, semiconductor–liquid interactions, and reactor dynamics. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC"

In this regard, the present study looks at the influence of retailer social responsibility and consumer environmental responsibility by reinforcing consumer’s green consumption behaviors. Similarly, the proposed study incorporates the mediating role of customer trust and environmental concern to understand whether retailer corporate social responsibility and consumer environmental responsibility strengthen green consumption behavior. Design/methodology/approach: Multiple hypotheses have been developed in light of the theoretical analysis of the available literature. The information was gathered through a survey method. A web-based portal was used to administer the survey, and 340 useable responses were processed by SPSS 23.0 and AMOS 23.0 for experiential analysis. First, the validity and reliability were evaluated. The authors then tested potential relationships using structural equation modeling. Findings: Survey data analyzed using the SEM approach reveal that consumer environmental responsibility and retailer CSR does not drive green consumption behavior directly. However, green concern and consumer trust mediates the relation of consumer environmental responsibility and retailer CSR towards green consumption behavior. Another mediating path was also tested through environmental responsibility and green concern among retailer's CSR and green consumption behavior. The outcomes of this path are also significant. Practical implications: The study holds promising implications for green consumption behaviors. The following can be achieved by implementing more sustainable supply chain strategies, such as lowering carbon footprint, purchasing eco-friendly goods and supporting environmental causes through retailers and consumers as well. Originality/value: This study investigated the joint contribution of retailer CSR and environmental responsibility to green consumption for the first time. The work strengthens the body of knowledge in the field of managerial decision-making and creates new directions for scholarly investigation. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Protective facial masks are rocketing, both in mass and in costs, in the food sector imposing efforts in fostering reuse strategies and in the achievement of sustainable development goals. The scope of the present paper is to depict possible strategies in manufacturing and reuse strategies that can reduce the carbon footprint (CF) of such devices. Design/methodology/approach: To implement circular economy strategies in the protective facial masks supply chain, it was considered significant to move towards a study of the environmental impact of such devices, and therefore a CF study has been performed on an FFP2 facial mask used in the food sector. Different materials besides the mostly used polypropylene (PP) (polyethylene (PE), polycarbonate (PC), poly (lactic acid) (PLA), cotton, polyurethane (PUR), polystyrene (PS) and nylon 6,6) and different sanitisation alternatives as reuse strategies (both laboratory and homemade static oven, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation) readily implemented have been modelled to calculate the CF of a single use of an FFP2 mask. Findings: The production of textiles in PP, followed by disposal was the main contributor to CF of the single-use FFP2 mask, followed by packaging and transportations. PP and PE were the least impacting, PC, cotton and Nylon 6-6 of the same weight results the worst. PLA has an impact greater than PP and PE obtained from crude oil, followed by PUR and PS. Static laboratory oven obtained an 80.4% reduction of CF with respect to single use PP-made FFP2 mask, whereas homemade oven obtained a similar 82.2% reduction; UV cabinet is the best option, showing an 89.9% reduction. Research limitations/implications: The key strategies to reduce the environmental impacts of the masks (research for new materials and reuse with sanitisation) should ensure both the retention of filtering capacities and the sanitary sterility of the reused ones. Future developments should include evaluations of textile recycling impacts, using new materials and the evaluation of the life cycle costs of the reused masks. Practical implications: This paper intends to provide to stakeholders (producers, consumers and policy makers) the tools to choose the best option for producing and reuse environmentally friendly protective facial masks to be used in the food sector, by using both different materials and easily implemented reuse strategies. Social implications: The reduction of the CF of protective facial masks in the food sector surely will have relevant positive effects on climate change contributing to reach the goals of reducing CO2 emissions. The food sector may promote sustainable practices and attract a niche piece of clients particularly sensible to such themes. Originality/value: The paper has two major novelties. The first one is the assessment of the CF of a single use of an FFP2 mask made with different materials of the non-woven filtering layers; as the major contribution to the CF of FFP2 masks is related to the non-woven textiles manufacturing, the authors test some other different materials, including PLA. The second is the assessment of the CF of one single use of a sanitised FFP2 mask, using different sanitation technologies as those allowed in bars or restaurants. © 2022, Pasquale Giungato, Bianca Moramarco, Roberto Leonardo Rana and Caterina Tricase."

The conventional Haber-Bosch (HB) process based on steam methane reforming (SMR) entails whopping CO2 emissions (i.e., 400 Mt y−1), therefore we propose a sustainable plant design comprising water electrolysis and cryogenic distillation for H2 and N2 production, respectively. This electrified configuration powered by wind energy affords 80% lower carbon emissions than the conventional SMR-based process. However, the electrolyser unit can represent between 36 and 61% of the total capital cost, depending on its energy efficiency, and its high energy demand drives the electricity cost which accounts for more than 68% of the plant operational costs. Thus, even with anticipated improvements in efficiency of the electrolyser unit, the Levelized Cost of Production (LCOP) of e-NH3 in a 2050 scenario is 65% higher than the current benchmark; nonetheless, the two processes could be equally viable with a 135.8 $ tCO2−1 carbon penalty on the average conventional process. Notably, the cost of electricity is the most prominent cost driver in the e-process, which could be more economically viable than the fossil counterpart with electricity prices below 12.5 $ MWh−1. These findings provide evidence that the proposed e-process can replace the commercial benchmark in small-scale, standalone applications. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC"

In this context, this work investigates the thermodynamic potential of hydrogen production from bio-oil steam reforming. Four routes – conventional steam reforming (CSR) and three advanced reforming processes – sorption-enhanced steam reforming (SESR), chemical looping steam reforming (CLSR) and sorption-enhanced chemical looping steam reforming (SE-CLSR) - were modeled for this purpose. Bio-oil was modeled as a complex mixture of model compounds belonging to all major oxygenate families in order to have a closer resemblance with raw bio-oil. CaO was selected as the sorbent, while NiO was selected as oxygen carrier. Furthermore, the effect of process parameters such as steam to carbon, sorbent to carbon, oxygen carrier to carbon ratios, and reforming temperature was explored. H2 purity and yield along with energy demand, served as the parameters for comparing the performance of the four processes. SESR provided the highest H2 yield (0.216 kgH2 kgBio-oil−1) among all the processes under optimum conditions along with a purity greater than 99 %. CLSR, meanwhile, had the lowest H2 yield and purity (0.178 kgH2 kgBio-oil−1 and 64.6 %, respectively). The combined SE-CLSR process had H2 yield greater than both CSR and CLSR (0.197 kgH2 kgBio-oil−1) and a H2 purity greater than 99 %. High in-situ heat generation was noted in the reforming reactor for both SESR and SE-CLSR, pointing towards a good potential for auto-thermal operation. Overall, SE-CLSR process is a highly intensified process with substantially lower energy requirements than all the other processes. The results highlight that by combining CO2-sorption and chemical looping with traditional reforming, H2 can be obtained in higher yields and purity and lower energy consumption. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC"

Utilization of hydrogen-based systems are challenged by cost effective storage methods. Bio-hydrogen storage technologies using cryogenic and adsorptive methods are discussed in this review paper, along with their operating conditions and storage capacities. An analysis of operational challenges and recent advancements in hydrogen storage techniques is presented. With a storage pressure of 70 MP, cryogenic hydrogen is almost twice as dense as compressed hydrogen. Technical challenges such as material cost and explosion risk can be addressed by hydrogen adsorption on activated carbon active sites. Maximum hydrogen storage capacity are reported by activated carbon obtained from Chitosan (6.77 wt%), Bamboo (6.6 wt%) and African palm shell (6.5 wt%) at 77 K and 4–20 Mpa. Further, nanotechnology approaches are presented in detail for increasing hydrogen storage capacity in pristine Si and Mg.

HalpernSGD exhibits a quadratic rate of convergence compared to the one of SGD, without compromising the accuracy of the model. We compared it with SGD and Adam through experiments that demonstrate HalpernSGD’s superior efficiency by significantly reducing the number of epochs required for convergence, thereby lowering energy consumption and carbon emissions.

Through a comprehensive survey, a diverse group of respondents provided valuable insights toward various CAV scenarios such as riding in a vehicle with no driver, self-driving public transport, self-driving taxis, and heavy vehicles without drivers. The results highlight the significant impact of safety concerns about automated vehicles on individuals' attitudes across all scenarios. Higher levels of concern were associated with more negative attitudes, and a strong correlation between concerns and opposition underlines the necessity of addressing these apprehensions to build public trust and promote CAV adoption. Interestingly, nearly 70% of respondents felt uncomfortable driving next to a CAV, but they displayed more confidence in adopting automated public transport in the near future. Additionally, around 40% of participants indicated a strong willingness to purchase a CAV, primarily driven by the desire to reduce their carbon footprint and safety considerations. Notably, respondents with health conditions or disability exhibited heightened interest (almost double those without health conditions) in CAV technology. Gender differences emerged in attitudes and preferences toward CAVs, with women expressing a greater level of concern and perceiving higher barriers to CAV deployment. This emphasizes the importance of employing targeted approaches to address the specific concerns of different demographics. The study also underscores the role of trust in technology as a significant barrier to CAV deployment, ranking high among respondents' concerns. To overcome these challenges and facilitate successful CAV deployment, various strategies are suggested, including live demonstrations, dedicated routes for automated public transport, adoption incentives, and addressing liability concerns. The findings from this study offer valuable insights for government agencies, vehicle manufacturers, and stakeholders in promoting the successful implementation of CAVs. By understanding societal acceptance and addressing concerns, decision-makers can devise effective interventions and policies to ensure the safe and widespread adoption of CAVs in Australia. Moreover, vehicle manufacturers can leverage these results to consider design aspects that align with passenger preferences, thereby facilitating the broader acceptance and adoption of CAVs in the future.

The concept of sustainability can be incorporated into soil stabilization by advocating the use of natural materials that are cost-effective, abundantly available, and have a low carbon footprint. Despite the proven effectiveness of traditionally used additives such as lime and cement, these materials are constantly criticized for their negative effects on the environment as a result of carbon dioxide emissions involved in their production. In contrast, magnesium-rich olivine is a naturally occurring mineral found abundantly in the earth’s subsurface. The presence of high amounts of MgO suggests that it may be effective in improving soil strength. The use of naturally available, magnesium-rich olivine or forsterite as a sustainable additive to stabilize a non-swelling soil is investigated in this research. Laboratory experiments conducted indicate that forsterite is effective in improving soil strength. The optimum dosage of forsterite for strength improvement was found to be 25% for all curing durations. The strength improvement is attributed to the development of M–S–H and M–A–H compounds as indicated by SEM micrographs. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024."

Using comprehensive measurements from two large WWTPs, simulation models were developed, employing both mechanistic (MCM) and machine learning (ML) approaches. The feasibility and limitations were explored for developing a generalized model with a transferable structure across different WWTPs. Three scenarios of input data were studied, including routine measurements, extended data set, and extended data set with a delay term. A hybrid approach was applied to support ML models with data generated by MCM. High consistency between measurements and ML model predictions was achieved, confirmed by the coefficient of determination equal to 0.71 - 0.76, 0.80 - 0.84, and 0.90 – 0.92 in the three scenarios, respectively. A key finding was that the extended data set improved the accuracy of multilayer perceptron model predictions while the number of neurons was insignificant. In the case of the K-nearest neighbors model, the number of neighbors did not affect results of simulation significantly regardless of the input data scenario. The results confirmed the potential for applying the same model structure at another WWTP but recalibration of model parameters was necessary. The ML models based on the hybrid approach can be further used to develop N2O mitigation strategies in full-scale WWTPs. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."

Decarbonizing India's economy would necessitate significant changes in how the country generates energy, manufactures things, delivers services and manages natural resources. Recently, scholars from different parts of the world have used various indicators like carbon and methane emissions to investigate potential solutions to the global warming problem that has resulted in climate change. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the impact of foreign direct investment, renewable and non-renewable energy consumption, in addition to economic growth, trade openness, and natural resources on ecological footprint. Design/methodology/approach: Using India's yearly data from 1990 to 2016, this research investigates the impact of direct foreign investment (FDI), trade (TA) and natural resources (NR) on the ecological footprint (EF) within the framework of economic growth (GDP), renewable (RE) and non-renewable (NRE) energy consumption. The Zivot–Andrews unit root approach was used to examine the structural breaks in data series and the presence of stationary. An auto regressive distributive lag model was used to investigate the presence of long-run and short-run dynamic relationships among the variables. Findings: The empirical findings demonstrate that FDI, RE and GDP have a negative and substantial impact on EF in the long term; in contrast, NRE and TA are significant and positive. The Granger causality test indicates that feedback transmission was observed between NR and EF and TA and EF. One-way causation passed from GDP to FDI and NR; TA to FDI and RE. Originality/value: Indian Government and authorities should push for an eco-friendly manufacturing process and technology adaptation to improve environmental quality. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."

This experimental study aims to explore the performance and emissions of compression ignition (CI) engines by introducing hydrogen into a biodiesel blend derived from algae. According to this study, the superior thermal properties of hydrogen associated with algal biodiesel have a significant impact on the performance and emissions of dual-fuel engines. The effect of hydrogen substitution rates of 10.4, 21.6, 32.4, 43.2, and 54 g per hour (g/h) on pure algae biodiesel was investigated. In comparison to diesel, the algae biodiesel reduces unburned hydrocarbons (UHC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions by 4.1% and 8.82%, respectively, while nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions increase by 18%. Diesel was found to have increased brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and decreased brake specific energy consumption (BSEC) compared to biodiesel. With the addition of pure biodiesel, the 43.2 g/h H2 substitution rate produces a maximum thermal efficiency of 1.92% and a 9.5% decrease in brake-specific energy consumption compared to diesel at maximum load. Compared to diesel, the emission attributes of UHC, CO, and smoke opacity decreased by about 45%, 48%, and 41%, respectively. However, NOx emissions increase by about 36% compared to diesel due to the higher flame temperature and carbon-free fuel of hydrogen and oxygenated biodiesel. The induction of 15% exhaust gas with B100 + 43.2 g/h H2 reduces NOx by about 31% in comparison to B100 + 43.2 g/h H2 without exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). This is primarily attributable to the high oxygen dilution and specific heat capacity of burned gases, which result in a decrease in peak cycle temperature. Compared to diesel, B100 + 43.2 g/h H2 increased the cylinder pressure and heat release rate by about 1.86 and 4.29%, respectively. As a result of its high energy density, hydrogen improves overall energy utilization and engine performance. Hydrogen's rapid flame speed and wide flammability range contribute to the efficient and complete combustion of the algae fueling the CI engine. As well as showing outstanding performance, dual fuel CI engines have the potential to significantly contribute to lowering emissions. Finally, it was determined that using algae biodiesel and exhaust gas recirculation with hydrogen substitution in diesel engines can significantly reduce emissions while increasing efficiency. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC"
453,Enhanced Nesquehonite Formation and Stability in the Presence of Dissolved Silica,Article,Pokharel R.; Popa I.C.; de Kok Y.; King H.E.,Environmental Science and Technology,58.0,2024,362,370,10.1021/acs.est.3c06939,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181568568&doi=10.1021%2facs.est.3c06939&partnerID=40&md5=5429317fc5b46ee76168d91eb56a82e8,0013936X,Scopus,attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy; carbon sequestration; enhanced weathering; green cement; hydrated Mg-carbonate; olivine carbonation; precipitation; transformation,"One possible carbon dioxide sequestration strategy is via the carbonation of dissolved Mg2+ obtained through olivine ((Mg,Fe)2SiO4) dissolution. However, silica is also produced during the breakdown of olivine. This component may have a detrimental effect on the yield of Mg-carbonate as Mg2+ incorporation into complex Mg silicate phases would limit CO2 uptake by this system. Yet this potential competition is currently not considered. Here, we use crystal growth experiments at temperatures applicable for potential coastal applications to test the effect of silica on the formation of the hydrated Mg-carbonate phase nesquehonite (MgCO3·3H2O). Solution chemistry analysis coupled with phase identification demonstrates that the presence of silica in the solution can actually assist the formation of nesquehonite and increase its yield by as much as 60 times. Our findings suggest that the presence of silica changes interfacial stabilities, lowering the energetic barrier for nesquehonite nucleation. In addition, in situ attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) transformation experiments demonstrated that nesquehonite precipitating in a solution containing a high concentration of dissolved silica exhibits enhanced stability against its transformation into hydromagnesite. These findings will help to better constrain what we expect for applications of olivine during carbon remediation strategies as well as assist yields for industrial applications that use Mg-based cement as building materials to facilitate a CO2-neutral or negative footprint. © 2023 The Authors.

Commonly natural aggregates are used in concrete. The amount and quality of natural aggregate may not be sufficient for building in some places of the world. As a result, alternative sources need to be researched. Current research focuses on using recycled materials instead of conventional concrete components to counteract the growing demand for natural resources. This review paper focuses on the role of steel slag aggregate (SSA) and recycled coarse aggregate (RCA) in concrete, considering different percentages of SSA (ranging from 0 to 50%) and RCA (from 0 to 100%). The review commences by evaluating the properties of SSA and RCA to assess their suitability as concrete aggregates. It then delves into their effects on both fresh and hardened concrete properties, including aspects like particle size distribution, workability, and strength. Through a comparative analysis, the review examines the physical and mechanical properties of these materials, encompassing factors like compressive strength and workability, particle size distribution with the aim of determining their appropriateness for various construction applications. Moreover, the environmental benefits of utilizing SSA and RCA are highlighted, which include reducing the carbon footprint, conserving natural resources, and reducing waste generation. In sum, this review paper provides a comprehensive exploration of the role of SSA and RCA in sustainable construction materials, underscoring their potential advantages at various percentages as a replacement of coarse aggregate. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024."

This study aims to solve this issue by using CFG through chemical conversion to synthesize clean fuel higher alcohols (HAS). The carbon emission reduction effect of the synthesis process was thoroughly analyzed using the atom economy evaluation, energy analysis, carbon metabolism evaluation, and carbon footprint evaluation methods. In this work, the HAS synthesis process ultimately released only 1.89% of the carbon in CFG as CO2. Compared with the direct emission of CFG without utilization, the direct carbon footprint of greenhouse gas emissions after HAS synthesis decreased by 87.68%. The chemical conversion of CFG into HAS is beneficial to carbon emission reduction and clean fuel production in the calcium carbide industry. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC"

Thereafter, novel and efficient technologies were implemented for green syngas production and its subsequent purification, increasing the overall process efficiency and achieving a significant reduction in the carbon footprint compared to mature synthetic crude production processes. Catalytic partial oxidation and dual pressure swing adsorption were integrated with co-electrolysis and Fischer–Tropsch synthesis in a scaled industrial plant, using residual streams from the complex or those of renewable origin as feed, which allowed the continuous operation of the process independent of renewable power generation. The mass and energy balance, performance, and efficiency estimations were also included in this study. A solid-oxide electrolytic cell (SOEC) plant using renewable electricity and heat input from thermal integration with the outlet syngas stream of the catalytic partial oxidation reactor was selected as a case study.

Using panel fixed effect model on a dataset of 66 listed firms over the period of five years from 2015-2016 to 2019-2020, the study finds negative impact of carbon intensity on firms' financial leverage indicating a direct association between carbon intensity and cost of debt. Further, the negative impact of carbon intensity on leverage is observed to be higher in case of firms undertaking energy management practices. The results suggest that firms should strive for decreasing the carbon footprints to take advantage of more debt in capital structure. Further, firms should strategically invest in energy management practices so that the same helps in attenuating the adverse impact of carbon intensity on leverage. © 2024 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."

Abundant research is going on to diminish CO2 content in the atmosphere by appropriate utilization of waste by-products of industries. Alkali-activated slag concrete (AASC) is an innovative green new concrete made by complete replacement of cement various supplementary cementitious raw materials. Concrete is a versatile material used in different fields of structures, so it is very important to study the durability in different exposures along with the strength. The purpose of this paper is to study the performance of AASC by incorporating quartz sand as fine aggregate under different exposure conditions. Design/methodology/approach: The materials for this innovative AASC are selected based on preliminary studies and literature surveys. Based on numerous trials a better performance mix proportion of AASC with quartz sand is developed with 1:2:4 mix proportion, 0.8 alkali Binder ratio, 19 M of NaOH and 50% concentration of Na2SiO3. Subsequently, AASC cubes are prepared and exposed for 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, 90, 112, 180, 252 and 365 days in ambient, acid, alkaline, sulfate, chloride and seawater and tested for compressive strength. In addition, to study the microstructural characteristics, scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis and X-ray diffraction analysis was also performed. Findings: Long-term performance of AASC developed with quartz sand is very good in the ambient, alkaline environment of 5% NaOH and seawater with the highest compressive strength values of 51.8, 50.83 and 64.46, respectively. A decrease in compressive strengths was observed after the age of 14, 56 and 112 days for acid, chloride and sulfate exposure conditions, respectively. SEM image shows a denser microstructure of AASC matrix for ambient, alkaline of 5% NaOH and seawater. Research limitations/implications: The proposed AASC is prepared with a mix proportion of 1:2:4, so the other proportions of AASC need to verify. In general plain, AASC is not used in practice except in few applications, in this work the effect of reinforced AASC is not checked. The real environmental exposure in fields may not create for AASC, as it was tested in different exposure conditions in the laboratory. Practical implications: The developed AASC is recommended in practical applications where early strength is required, where the climate is hot, where water is scarce for curing, offshore and onshore constructions exposed to the marine environment and alkaline environment industries like breweries, distilleries and sewage treatment plants. As AASC is recommended for ambient air and in other exposures, its implementation as a construction material will reduce the carbon footprint. Originality/value: The developed AASC mix proportion 1:2:4 is an economical mix, because of low binder content, but it exhibits a higher early age compressive strength value of 45.6 MPa at the age of 3 days.

This life cycle analysis considers hydrogen production on a per-kilogram basis for 11 pathways, fossil and non-fossil. It also includes impacts of treating water to the required quality for hydrogen production. Greenhouse gas emissions results were in a range of −15 to +31 kg CO2e/kg H2 produced. Water consumption varied more widely, from about 7 to 55 kg water/kg H2 for fossil-based pathways and 530 to 3400 kg water/kg H2 for biomass-based pathways. Electrolysis with various renewable electricity scenarios were also modeled. Overall, there are challenging tradeoffs to be navigated to achieve a low carbon and water footprint in hydrogen economy. © 2023"

This work utilizes crustacean waste consisting of inedible shells to isolate chitin and its derivatives, chitin nanocrystals and chitosan, from lobster (Homarus gammarus) and spider crab (Maja squinado) shells. Chitin nanocrystals (ChNCs) with a degree of acetylation >93% and crystallinity >90% were obtained by demineralization, deproteinization and acid-hydrolysis, while chitosan was obtained by chitin deacetylation. Free-standing chitosan/ChNCs films were then fabricated from lobster and spider crab after dissolution and casting using 1.5% v/v formic acid. Lobster-derived materials exhibited a good balance between UV-shielding ability, blocking >96% of UV-C and UV-B, while being transparent at visible wavelengths. Neat chitosan films are semiductile, with elongations at break >13% and Young’s modulus values of 2.3 ± 0.7 and 3.4 ± 1.2 GPa for lobster and spider crab-derived chitosan, respectively. Besides, the incorporation of ChNCs increases the Young’s modulus to 5.5 ± 0.8 GPa at 2 wt % for lobster-derived films. Life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted to quantify the environmental impact of film production and identify process hotspots for future optimization. A carbon footprint of 79.8 kg CO2 equiv·kg-1 is obtained for chitosan/ChNC films processed using a 100% renewable energy mix. Results demonstrate that lobster-derived materials are relevant contenders toward defossilization by developing renewable-carbon containing bioproducts with competitive performance against fossil-based materials due to their optical and mechanical properties, as well as their potential biodegradability. © 2024 The Authors.

Nevertheless, it is commonly overlooked in hydrogen production pathway classifications. This study applies life-cycle assessment to shed light on the environmental impacts of chlor-alkali hydrogen based on diverse production and methodological aspects, and compares the most appropriate utilization scenarios in terms of GHG savings. The results demonstrate a broad range of carbon footprint from 0.01 to 7.14 kg CO2 eq./kg with a high dependance on consumed energy sources and adopted allocation method. When analyzing the scenarios of utilization, the most favorable scenario in terms of potential savings is the substitution of high-emission grey hydrogen. According to our results, chlor-alkali hydrogen could be considered renewable or low-emission following the standards set by the EU, and thus can facilitate the transition to carbon neutrality. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC"

If excessive use causes decreased efficiency and increased operational costs. Decreased efficiency contributes to increasing exhaust gas volumes and greenhouse emissions. Efficient energy can achieved if planning and predictions are correct. This research applies the GRU neural network method with grid search initialization as a novelty predictive model for energy-use high-rise buildings in form fast training without multiple iterations because optimal hyperparameters are obtained. Experimental show the MAE and RMSE performance metrics of the GRU better than LSTM in predicting energy consumption data peak loads, off-peak loads and reactive power. The accuracy of GRU predictions can optimize the use of energy to contribute to saving the environment from exhaust emissions and the greenhouse effect in urban systems. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of GRU over LSTM, proof of the much lower MAE and RMSE values. This metric shows the accuracy of GRU in generalizing data both during peak and off-peak hours, as well as in reactive power usage. By Utilizing GRU's capabilities, building management can manage reactive power usage effectively, allocate reactive power resources appropriately, and mitigate peak load times and the power factor within the threshold, thus avoiding additional costs and electrical system efficiency and contributing to reducing the carbon footprint and gas emissions greenhouse.

The participants of the discourse are scientists, officials, entrepreneurs, and representatives of other social groups, who are balanced between two extreme forms of climate consciousness—climate skepticism and climate alarmism. In accordance with the assessment of climate challenges, an attitude is formed towards the state climate policy being developed for the elimination of and adaptation to emerging threats. The analysis of the positions that have developed in society resulted in the identification of four approaches to the state climate policy. Climate skepticism causes the rejection of climate policy in Russian society (due to its negative impact on economics, the inefficiency of measures, the unfavorable conditions of international agreements on decarbonization). Support for the theory of anthropogenic climate change distinguishes proponents of a climate policy based on the introduction of “green transition” principles, the formation of a circular economy, the intention to achieve carbon neutrality through carbon regulation, the technological modernization of electricity generation, and industrial processes characterized by a large carbon footprint (cast iron and steel, aluminum, cement, ammonia, etc.). However, the implementation of low-carbon development programs in Russia shows that the goals run counter to the objectives of economic security, which the authorities consider to be a priority in a resource-based development model (e.g. measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions should not limit the national economic potential or affect the competitiveness of key industries). The third approach, which we call a differentiated or selective climate policy, considers both the negative and positive effects of climate change. Depending on the type of environmental risks for certain territories, climate policy should be based on selective measures. Finally, a fourth approach is to abandon low-carbon development strategies in favor of adapting to climate change. The features of these four approaches are analyzed in detail in our work. © (2024) All Rights Reserved."

Magnesia-based binders have gained much attention recently due to increasing environmental protection concerns. Their low environmental impact due to reduced carbon footprint and conservation of resources make them a useful alternative to ordinary Portland cement (OPC) for soil improvement. Further, their intrinsic characteristics, such as rapid setting and hardening without moist curing, are conducive to the rapid improvement of soft soils. In this research, the effects of incorporating reactive magnesia, magnesium oxychloride cement, magnesium, phosphate cement, and magnesium potassium phosphate cement in soils have been studied, and the corresponding influence on the mechanical, microstructural, and durability properties of MgO-solidified soils at different molar ratios, water-to-binder ratios, and curing times have been investigated.

Use of alternate materials that have lower carbon footprint and reduce environmental hazards is tenets of this modern approach. Approach toward alternative source of material for tailing storage facility which will be developed inside an abandoned mining pit is described in this study. The work considers the study of various engineering properties for secondary product from process plant, waste overburden from mining, and tailing from ore processing plant. Thereafter, detailed site investigations were done for developing an abandoned mining pit to a tailing storage facility. The outcomes from the studies were used for design and construction of tailing dam over a reclaimed land in an abandoned mining pit. The previous designs for tailing dam construction involved use of selected borrow earth having desirable index and strength properties. Objective of the study is the alternative use of waste material for dam construction where sustainability of plant operation was the key.

Using this approach to energy trading, without simultaneously minimizing energy consumption, defeats the purpose of using such trading solutions to encourage renewable energy production and may even cancel out any ecological benefits. This paper demonstrates that it is possible to create a DLT-based energy trading system which provides security, transparency, autonomy, scalability, and decentralization, provided by using a DLT, but with significantly lower penalties than other previously known solutions. This is best illustrated through the fact that the carbon footprint per transaction of the solution presented in this paper is 0.19 grams of CO-{2} compared to 20 grams of CO-{2} created by single transaction of similar complexity on the Ethereum blockchain. This makes per-transaction carbon footprint of our system approximate 100 times smaller than that of the most commonly used Ethereum blockchain. We present the architecture and features of the proposed platform, as well as a thorough analysis of its performance, including power consumption and estimated carbon footprint. All experiments are done on a dedicated Beowulf cluster comprised of general-purpose computers. The cluster mimics a microgrid environment and presents a testing ground for real-world performance and power consumption analysis of a system used for trading energy predominantly produced from prosumers and their renewable sources.  © 2013 IEEE."

A nanofiber mat consisting of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), nanoTiO2, and citric acid (PTC) was prepared using an electrospinning technique at a constant flow rate (0.5 ml/h). The morphology of the mat was detected using (FESEM) technique and image J software. The results show that the mat has a nanofiber morphology with an average diameter of 170 nm. This mat was used to remove methylene blue (MB) from water in two ways, the adsorption process and by photodegradation using UV light. The kinetic study of the adsorption of methylene blue MB on a PTC mat was carried out. Results show that the pseudo-second order is the best to describe the adsorption, of MB, and the intraparticle diffusion is the rate determining step. Seven isotherm models; four of two-parameters and three of three-parameters were used to examine the adsorption experimental data by applying linear and non-linear regression methods using six error functions. The results showed comparable data between linear and non-linear regression methods for two parameters isotherms, and the best isotherm fitting with the data were Freundlich and Temkin models. On the contrary, three parameters isotherms showed distracted data between linear and non-linear regression methods. In addition, the results appear that the best predictive error function was Chi-square. © 2024 Slovensko Kemijsko Drustvo. All rights reserved."

Raw earth is an excellent passive hygrothermal regulator, which improves occupants’ comfort while reducing the need for active heating/cooling. Modelling the coupled hygrothermal behaviour of earthen materials is however highly complex and requires the introduction of some simplifying assumptions. The degree of hygrothermal coupling depends on the chosen equations of moisture and heat transfer including the specific forms of the water/ vapour permeability functions and retention law. The influence of these assumptions is here investigated via a simple one-dimensional transfer model, which simulates the behaviour of an earth wall subjected to time-dependent cycles of temperature and relative humidity on the two faces. Results show that the complexity of the governing equations can be greatly reduced by neglecting the variations of vapour mass and the dependency of suction on temperature without losing accuracy. In addition, the moisture buffering capacity of the material strongly depends on the liquid permeability which, in turn, is a function of both saturated permeability and water retention properties. © 2024 Patron Editore S.r.l..

Aviation's contribution was found to be the most important source of GHG emissions from tourism. Also, the hospitality sector contributes a lot to GHG emissions in tourism destinations. Hospitality, constituting an essential component of the tourism industry, is a sector that has a high potential to reduce GHG and use of energy and water resources. Therefore, it is important to monitor the climate change mitigation performance of tourism destinations to achieve decarbonization of the tourism sector. The main objectives of this paper are to develop indicators of climate change mitigation performance of tourism destinations based on GHG indicators for the transport and hospitality sectors and apply this framework to assessment and ranking based on climate change mitigation performance of 4 main EU geographical regions as tourism destinations: Central, Northern, Southern, and Western Europe. This paper's main methodological approach is comparing and ranking different geographical regions in the European Union by assessing their climate change mitigation performance as tourist destinations. The study's main results showed that Finland, representing North Europe, is the best-performing country in climate change mitigation in tourism destinations. The second-best-performing geographical region is Western Europe. The worst-performing EU region based on climate change mitigation in tourism destinations was Central Europe. The South Europe region was found to be in a slightly better position than Central Europe but worse in comparison with Western Europe and especially in comparison to Northern Europe. The study's main implications provide policy recommendations for Central Europe as a tourism destination to increase energy and water use efficiency and the carbon footprint of the tourism sector. © 2024 Center for International Scientific Research of VSO and VSPP.

Since the CCUS technologies have different technological constraints for CO2 sequestration, it is essential to apply a unified evaluation framework to assess and analyze various CCUS technologies in perspective of CO2 disposal. In this study, we aim to assess and analyze the CCUS technologies in specific problems of maximizing net present value (NPV) and CO2-eq reduction considering various constraints. This study developed an optimization-based framework to analyze and assess the CCUS technologies regarding technical, economic, and environmental performance. To achieve this goal, we developed a superstructure involving a series of technologies (e.g., CO2 capture, transportation, CO2 conversion, and separation) to storage and utilize captured CO2. We then estimated the technical and economic parameters (i.e., mass flow, energy flow, sizing data and costing data) based on the literature and the process model by developed Aspen Plus. The optimization models were developed to identify the optimal CCUS strategies with different criteria: NPV, and CO2-eq reduction. With scenario-based analysis, this study also determined that the priority of various CCUS technologies considering critical constraints such as the cost and CO2-eq inventory of H2 according to the resource of H2 and utility. This paper offers actionable policy guidance with NPV and CO2-eq reduction for high carbon-footprint nations considering the CCUS strategy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

The subsoil is often stabilized with lime/cement to improve its performance and durability. The use of lime/cement promotes the carbon footprint due to their high embodied energy. On the other hand, soil stabilization with biopolymers such as Xanthan Gum (XG) has demonstrated promising results in strength enhancement and negligible ecological risks. The ECM is expected to have a high unconfined compressive strength (UCS) along with low erodibility and thermal conductivity. The current study investigates the influence of biopolymer amendment varying from 0.5% to 1.5% by weight of soil on the UCS, erodibility, and thermal characteristics of an abundantly available highly plastic silty soil in the Brahmaputra valley of the Assam region of India. The study reveals that the increment in biopolymer content results in a fourfold increment in the UCS of bare soil with no practical variation in the thermal conductivity, implying their potential to provide thermal comfort as a building unit. However, the pocket erosion test revealed that although the biopolymer treatment drastically enhances the erosion resistance of untreated soil, the proposed ECM remains in medium erodibility class, limiting its applicability in infrastructures designed for the long term. Nonetheless, the proposed ECM can be utilized effectively as a building unit for the rapid construction of temporary infrastructure, specifically for armed forces and highway engineers that are required to stay at a workstation transiently. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024."

One of the research actions is focused on the development of eco-friendly alloys with more recycled scrap material in order to reduce emissions, but this can also result in greater variability of material properties. In this context, accurately characterizing the formability limits of materials is of paramount importance for optimizing manufacturing processes. Although ISO 12004-2:2008 standard is commonly used for necking detection, recent years have seen time-dependent methods yield more accurate predictions. Nevertheless, in materials exhibiting the Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) effect, such as some common lightweight alloys used in automotive and aeronautics, necking detection introduces significant challenges, and even more so when the material is subjected to severe local stretch-bending states. In this work, various necking detection techniques were employed to analyze their capabilities in a series of stretch-bending experiments over a 2.94 mm thick AA5754H11 PLC-driven material. © 2024, Association of American Publishers.

Generally, the presented carbon footprint estimation methods calculate the product of the compute hardware’s energy consumption and a factor expressing the emissions for the corresponding energy produced in the region where the compute hardware is located. However, there are three open issues. First, the methods for determining the energy consumption are inaccurate or lack an evaluation of the accuracy. Second, most tools use as carbon intensity a static long-term average, e.g., over a year, that the tool authors gathered once, but since some regions have a carbon intensity varying each day and throughout the year, the accuracy of using a static carbon intensity is unclear and requires an evaluation. Third, most tools enable estimates for a single computer or a homogeneous set of computers only, excluding the easy carbon footprint estimation for scenarios with a heterogeneous set of compute hardware. In this paper, we make three contributions. First, we analyze the evaluation gap regarding methods for determining the compute hardware’s power consumption. Second, using example cases, we show that estimating a carbon footprint using a static long-term average carbon intensity compared to hourly carbon intensity time series data can lead to large errors; in the worst case among the example, the error was 325.8%. Third, we present a tool assisting with carbon footprint estimates using time series carbon intensity data and also supporting heterogeneous compute hardware. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."

Hence, this cross-sectional study was conducted in the Kalyani subdivision of Nadia district, West Bengal, India. Data were collected from 610 households, comprising 299 rural and 311 urban households, to analyse energy consumption patterns for various purposes. To summarize the dependent and continuous data, descriptive statistics were employed, while for inferences, independent sample t-test, Pearson correlation and regression were used. A significant difference was observed in total annual household carbon footprint between the urban and rural households due to varied energy consumption (t = 15.60, p < 0.05). The urban households were emitting twice (2325.20 kgCO2e) as much as the rural ones (1125.77 kgCO2e). It can also be inferred that emission was determined by the increase in household size, income, and improvement in the standard of living. Thus, in addition to several determinants, a complex cultural system, social practices, and awareness of green consumerism should also be incorporated and studied through an interdisciplinary approach to reduce the overall household carbon footprint. © 2024, Association for Promotion of Holistic Approach to Environment.

This study explores the potential of biochar derived from common reed (Phragmites australis) as a sustainable and multifaceted tool for the removal of toluene, a representative BTEX compound, from aqueous solutions. By harnessing reed straw as the precursor material for biochar production, this research showcases an environmentally friendly alternative to conventional disposal methods, such as incineration, offering the dual benefit of pollutant removal and carbon emissions reduction. The influence of pyrolysis temperature on biochar properties and its adsorption efficiency for toluene were rigorously examined, revealing a direct correlation between temperature and biochar's pollutant sequestration capabilities. Results indicate that higher pyrolysis temperatures led to biochar (RB-750) with superior specific surface area (68.07 m2/g) and enhanced adsorption capabilities, demonstrating its potential as a powerful adsorbent in water treatment. The scanning electron microscope analysis revealed a complex, porous structure rich in active sites, validating the biochar's suitability for pollutant adsorption. Optimal dosage was determined at 8 g/l, achieving an impressive toluene removal efficiency of 98.1%. Additionally, pH and initial toluene concentration significantly influenced removal efficiency. This study underscores the multifaceted potential of reed straw-derived biochar in combating water pollution while concurrently contributing to carbon emissions reduction through sustainable utilization of abundant wetland resources.

Specifically, a towbar used for aircraft pushback was considered as case study. All phases of the life cycle of the analyzed component were included (from the raw materials extraction to the disposal phase). The comparison between the CFRP towbar investigated and a traditional one in aluminum alloy was performed. The LCC analysis was conducted by considering all costs associated with the automated filament winding process, from the initial investment costs. For all the considered impact categories, the CFRP towbar showed the lowest environmental impacts, mainly due to both the reduced weight and service life fuel consumption.

Concurrently, numerous households are adopting RES to generate their own energy, aiming to decrease both electricity costs and carbon footprints. To support these users, many papers have been devoted to developing optimal investment strategies for residential energy systems. However, there is still a significant gap as these studies often neglect important aspects like carbon neutrality. For this reason, in this paper, we explore the concept of net-zero energy houses (ZEHs) - houses designed to have an annual net energy consumption around zero - by presenting a constrained optimization problem to find the optimal number of photovoltaic panels and the optimal size of the battery system for home integration. Solving this constrained optimization problem is difficult due to its nonconvex constraints. Nevertheless, by applying a series of transformations, we reveal that it is possible to find an equivalent linear programming (LP) problem which is computationally tractable. The attainment of ZEH can be tackled by introducing a single constraint in the optimization problem. Additionally, we propose a sharing economy approach to the investment problem, offering a strategy that could potentially reduce investment costs and facilitate the attainment of ZEH more efficiently. Finally, we apply the proposed frameworks to a neighborhood in Japan as a case study, demonstrating the potential for long-term ZEH attainment. The results show that, under the right incentive, users can achieve ZEH, reduce their electricity costs and have a minimal impact on the main grid.  © 2013 IEEE."

Covering the acquisition of raw materials to the end of the production process in biomass power plants (cradle to grave: C2G). The study proposes constructive ways to reduce the carbon footprint of biomass power plants. Conducted research consisting of 3 phases: phase 1, the rubber plantation process; phase 2, the rubber wood processing plant; and phase 3, the biomass power plant. Assessment of carbon footprint: following the principle of life cycle assessment, the results of the carbon footprint assessment found that in Phase 1, the process of growing rubber trees throughout the life cycle calculated the carbon footprint of the sample group as average greenhouse gas emissions from fresh rubber wood and combined with the average greenhouse gas emissions from rubber wood timbers of 1.1186 kgCO2eq per day. In phase 2, rubber wood processing plants throughout the life cycle have average greenhouse gas emissions of 15,319.11 kgCO2eq per day. In phase 3, biomass power plants electricity capacity is 9.9 MW per day, and their greenhouse gas emissions are 44,753.60 kg CO2eq per day. The result found that greenhouse gas emissions from biomass power plants per 1 kWh accounted for a carbon dioxide equivalent of 4.52 kgCO2eq. Calculate the predictor factors affecting the amount of greenhouse gases in biomass power plants in raw score form as Y = 373.516 +.082 (raw material quantity), where Y is the greenhouse gas emission (kgCO2eq), using the forecast equation in standard score form. With Z =.983raw material quantity3, It was found that the quantity of raw materials had a positive correlation with the quantity of greenhouse gases at a statistical significance of .01 with a correlation coefficient of .983, which could explain the variability of the variables of the quantity of greenhouse gases with 96.70 percent accuracy. © 2024, Thaksin University.

Worldwide initiatives are underway across various sectors to diminish carbon footprint. To produce mold fluxes for the continuous casting of steel, free carbon is typically used to control their melting rate (due to the skeleton effect), in variable contents depending on the industrial process (2-25 wt%). When the mold fluxes are applied to liquid steel, the free carbon oxidizes, producing CO2(g) and CO(g). Raw materials typically used as sources of carbon are carbon black, coke dust, fine graphite, and fly ash. By reducing the free carbon content of mold fluxes which are used in the production of ultra-low carbon (ULC) steels, it is possible not only to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also to decrease carbon pick-up by the steel, which is a serious problem for ULC steel grades. In the present work, a literature review was made for the replacement of carbon with nitrides and with other exothermic agents, considering the two challenges: (i) to decrease CO2(g) and CO(g) emissions and (ii) to reduce carbon pick-up by ULC steel. Furthermore, some preliminary results of a research project in progress are shown. Melting rate qualitative measurements were performed considering exothermic mold flux recipes. It was found that for a base material with no fossil carbon added, but still containing 0.5 wt% carbon due to the addition of organic binder in the slurry used for the granulation process, the melting rate increases as the content of the exothermic materials increases. © 2024 by the Association for Iron & Steel Technology."

Indeed, the country has realized that it is time to monitor its environmental indicators such as energy consumption, accounting, and carbon footprint to comply with global efforts to reduce carbon footprint and aim for energy efficiency while preserving and optimizing its energy resources. Much attention has been focused on the transportation sector, the second-largest global polluter, which will be the subject of our analysis. Our case study will focus on the evaluation of three vehicles to examine the influence of driver behavior on energy consumption and carbon footprint. Data collection was carried out using UPLOGISTIX, a solution developed by our hosting entity, which aims to present calculations of environmental measures to display the results and ultimately provide recommendations for reducing its carbon footprint. An approach has been proposed to achieve the set objectives. The results of our analysis highlight the existence of a significant relationship between behavioral barriers and energy consumption. Indeed, the behavior of a reckless driver, characterized by abrupt braking, rapid accelerations, and other factors, leads to an actual energy consumption that exceeds recommended standards. This excessive consumption results in a considerable production of CO2 emissions. © 2024 The Authors. Published by ELSEVIER B.V."

Accurate measurement and analysis of the basic state and spatial correlation of urban-rural carbon emissions is the basic prerequisite for formulating the ""double carbon"" policy. This study aims to analyze the regional disparities in urban-rural carbon emissions in China from 2005 to 2021 and to assess the degree of inequality in such emissions. The IPCC methodology was employed to calculate the carbon emissions of urban and rural areas in each province. The Theil coefficient was utilized to delineate the spatial evolution of urban-rural carbon emission disparities in China. The decomposition of the Theil index was adopted to investigate the sources and shifts in spatial disparities. The local Moran’s I was applied to analyze the spatial correlation of urban and rural carbon emissions in China. Additionally, the Theil index was employed to measure the degree of urban-rural carbon emission inequality in each province. Based on the natural breakpoint grading method, the spatial heterogeneity of the urban-rural carbon emission inequality across various Chinese provinces was scrutinized. Findings: China’s urban-rural carbon emission inequality exhibited a three-phase transformation, predominantly influenced by intraregional factors, with the Northeast region making a significant contribution. Spatially, eastern coastal and inland provinces like Hebei and Shandong exhibited higher carbon emissions, whereas western provinces such as Gansu and Qinghai showed lower levels. The majority of regions witnessed their emission disparities transition from mid-low to mid-high. However, challenges related to insufficient and imbalanced development remained prominent. Specifically, economically advanced regions like Guangdong and Jiangsu manifested substantial emission disparities, while western provinces like Sichuan displayed smaller disparities. © 2024, HARD Publishing Company.

Their endeavours not only enhance the customer experience but also contribute to a more sustainable and ethical financial system, with the potential to reduce the carbon footprint as digital banking gains traction in India. We examine whether ESG-rated banks can diminish customer effort and improve the overall customer experience, ultimately encouraging greater participation in sustainable financial practices. We employ text mining to analyse 2156 reviews of ESG-rated banks' digital services, from which we derive the Customer Effort Score. We find a linear relationship between the ESG values and the Customer Effort Score. The customer reviews suggest that neo-banks in India have the potential to revolutionize the banking industry. However, they need to address customers' concerns regarding the limited range of products and services offered and the high interest rates on loans. ESG-rated banks are more likely to take a customer-centric approach to their business. Banks with firm ESG commitments tend to uphold transparent supply chains, improving customer experiences and higher Customer Effort Scores. Consequently, banks are increasingly adopting ESG principles as an integral part of their business models. ESG ratings are a valuable metric for gauging a bank's commitment to long-term sustainability. We find that banks with a strong commitment to ESG principles are more likely to maintain transparent and ethical supply chains, thereby reducing the risk of their customers encountering privacy-related issues or questionable practices. © 2024 University of Brunei Darussalam.

To mitigate the environmental hazard posed by the disposal of fly ash (FA) and ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) waste and reduce cement consumption, effective promotion of the geopolymerization technique is necessary. Incorporating sintered fly ash coarse aggregate (SFA) in GPC makes the concrete light in weight. This study involves the synthesis of geopolymer technology using FA and GGBS, as the primary source material. Due to the lack of an appropriate mix design method for using SFA in GPC, their application as a structural concrete is scanty. By using FA and GGBS with 100% SFA, a novel mix design methodology that offers greater simplicity and consistency is established in the present study. The proposed method is further verified by developing different concretes with alkali content to binder (AC/B) ratios ranging from 0.3 to 0.8. Fresh densities range between 1860 and 1930 kg/m3 and maximum compressive strength of nearly 50 MPa was attained after 28 days of ambient curing. The binder penetration and internal curing in SFA indicate that GGBS and FA have a superior synergistic effect on the efficacy of lightweight GPC using SFA. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

LCA is used to conduct an analysis of 17 types of emissions caused by rice and wheat production per hectare in Madhya Pradesh. Based on LCIA and Monte Carlo simulation, the study provides valuable insights into the regional environmental emissions associated with direct seeded rice (DSR), irrigated wheat (IW) and rainfed wheat (RW). Study shows that except for Marine eutrophication (MEUT) and Agricultural land use (ALU), rice production has relatively higher impact than wheat production. Irrigated wheat production found with higher potential of causing non-cancerous diseases caused by air pollution, whereas rice production has the potential to contribute to cancer disease. The production of rice and wheat in Madhya Pradesh state cumulatively contributes 0.008 Gt CO2 eq. (0.10% of global total) to the global agrifood system GHG emission within farmgate.

Pope Francis’ 2023 Laudate Deum and Quaker Faith and Practice are cited in particular. Walter Wink’s non-violent Jesus is offered as a rationale for creative, prophetic enactment and non-violent direct action (NVDA); and lessons are learned from the success of the 1960s American Civil Rights movement. The Christian Climate Action movement is outlined as a place where authentic and effective enactment takes place.

Many methods exist to estimate ecological metrics, such as the Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) in the individual product development phases with stand-alone software. However, methods to integrate the PCF in the entire process chain with the possibility to interact in the process are missing. This paper presents a new approach to measuring the ecological impact of an Additive Manufacturing production process, exemplified by the Material Extrusion (MEX) process. The novelty of the approach lies in implementing a single software for machine control, processing, and visualization of sensor signals, parameter variation, and reporting functions to enable comprehensive PCF management. The workflow includes a model-based prediction of the PCF based on the G-code, live monitoring during the production phase, and a subsequent automated evaluation at a central interface. Critical points can be identified, and approaches for optimizing the MEX process can be designed. Uncertainty evaluation of the PCF based on the combination of uncertainty of the sensors and the Life Cycle Assessment is included in the method. The developed prototype software can be used in the design phase for prediction and in the process phase for optimization, enabling seamless PCF management for the MEX process. © 2024 Elsevier B.V..

The construction sector has become a significant contributor to environmental deterioration due to its extensive energy consumption, raw material extraction, and waste generation. One of the ways to reduce the environmental impact of the construction sector is to decrease the embodied carbon footprint of buildings using the three R approaches – reduce, reuse, recycle and by using renewable construction materials. The paper focusses on the evaluation of the behaviour of steel-intensive façade systems from an environmental impact perspective. The research presented in the paper shows a comparative Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) of industrial buildings that have envelopes consisting of liner tray cladding systems and sandwich panel cladding systems. The results of this comparison show that when different envelope solutions are considered, the highest potential benefits (8–25% higher) occur for structures that have liner tray cladding systems and the highest loads (11–19% higher) appear for structures that have sandwich panel cladding systems. Moreover, the potential for repeated reuse in the case of claddings based on steel liner trays is superior to the potential for repeated reuse of sandwich panels, helping to reduce the environmental impact of the cladding system even after its second life cycle. © The Author(s) 2024."

The present work aims to study the feasibility of the incorporation of this residue in the production of concrete to reduce the dilemma of its disposal on huge amounts, decrease the quantities of natural materials used in concrete assembly and produce a lower carbon footprint concrete. Hence, the CSW were divided into three parts, the first part contains the fraction of fine particles (< 80 µm) (residue 1), the second part contains the entire CSW (residue 2) and the third part contains the rest of CSW after the elimination of residue 1 by sieving (residue 3). Then, the introduction of CSW into concrete was achieved, on one hand, by replacing 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10% of cement by residue 1 and, on the other hand, by substituting 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25% of river sand and crushed sand by residues 2 and 3, separately. In order to qualify and analyze the behavior of this residues in the company of other components of concrete, several chemical and physical characteristics of CSW were evaluated. In addition, CSW were characterized by x-ray fluorescence (XRF), x-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The various constituents used in the manufacturing of concrete were characterized physically including particle size distribution, fineness modulus, cleanliness of the sand, flattening coefficient, hardness, apparent density and actual density to conclude the formulation used for the development of the specimens. In addition, the properties of fresh and hardened concretes were also investigated, including Abrams cone subsidence, density and compressive strength. The outcome of this study concludes that modest amounts of CSW improve the physical properties of concretes and consequently their compressive strength, especially at 90 days, whatever the type of martial being substituted. Thus, the introduction of residue 1 into the cement must not exceed 2%, the replacement of residue 2 by river and crushed sands can be done at rates up to 5 and 10%, respectively, while the residue 3 can only substitute river sand at a rate up to 10%. © 2024, Polskie Towarzystwo Inzynierii Ekologicznej (PTIE).

It is a three-dimensional digital replica of asset(s) such as buildings, which contain architectural information and building details (e.g. dimensions, materials, parts, and components). It has evolved from 2D CAD models (or blueprints) in the past to 3D CAD models embedded with information layers (e.g., construction time sequence or 4D-BIM), resulting in automation in construction. BIM has now been essential in various countries; for example, new UK BIM standards require asset owners to keep and maintain building information. BIM adopts an interoperable concept that can benefit the whole life-cycle assessment (LCA) and circularity of the built environments. Its applications extend to six dimensions (6D) where time sequence, cost and carbon footprint can now be reported in real time. These attributes are essential to stakeholders and critically help reduce any unexpected consumption and waste over the life cycle of a project. This study builds on the development of 6D BIM of an existing building to enrich circular value chains and stakeholder engagement. This paper highlights the development of 6D BIM, and, subsequently, the stakeholder interviews to address challenges, barriers, benefits, and effectiveness of 6D-BIM applications for stakeholder engagements across circular value chains. Snowballing sampling method has been used to identify stakeholder interviews to obtain new insights into the digital valorisation for stakeholder engagement.

One such method is introducing the concept of biomimicry. Biomimicry is utilized in the field of design to solve problems. This paper mainly discusses the mimicking of human skeleton for structural design. The idea is mimicking humerus bone as a tension member and femur bone as a compression member. The optimized members of compression and tension (strut and tie) were put together to form the mimicked king post truss analytically with the conventional cross-section truss. Three cases were considered analytically with average diameter, maximum diameter, and equivalent self-weight to the members of mimicked truss, and experimentally testing with non-destructive test and point-load test. The result shows that the ultimate load-carrying capacity of critical compression member and tension member was 846.16 and 1952 kN, respectively, whereas the achieved load was 780.30 and 1729 kN. Also, the ratio of analytical stiffness to self-weight is 21.83 mm–1 and the ratio of experimental stiffness to self-weight was 19.15 mm–1. Therefore, from the results it was observed that the equivalent results for mimic truss can be achieved in a truss which is modeled of equivalent self-weight. Hence, the development and use of structural elements using biomimicry is feasible and will lead to economic, green, and energy-efficient structures. © 2024 by Begell House, Inc."

The vehicle body of an electric vehicle is largely made of different steel grades and its production has a major impact on greenhouse gas emissions within the production stage. Future steel production will include a scrap-based electric arc furnace route. This route produces CO2-reduced steel products. However, these products are dependent on the scrap quality. Due to the high scrap content, impurities or tramp elements can be in the molten steel, reducing the steel end-quality or the properties of the final material and limiting reuse of the steel scrap. Therefore, a methodology is developed to perform an experimental analysis for data collection. Through this methodology, a recovery-process-structure-property correlation can be established and thus the influence of manufacturing-related impurities on the mechanical properties can be investigated. A case study shows initial research results using exemplary steel grades. The concept can examine the possibility of using steel with low carbon footprint to advance the life cycle engineering (LCE) idea in terms of recycling steel scrap and to reduce the environmental impact of body components by using CO2-reduced steel. © 2024 The Author(s)."

The environmental impact of a structure must be reduced from the design phase by using reliable design approaches and choosing the production and construction processes that minimise as much as possible the carbon footprint. The purlins are components of the roof structure and their scope is to transfer the roof loads to the rafters. An efficient design of purlins is generally achieved by using cold-formed steel Z-shaped profiles. Z purlins span continuously over the rafters to reduce material use through a more favourable bending moment distribution. To ensure continuity of the bending moment along the length of the structure, the purlins form overlapped connections on the supports. The focus of this research paper is to assess through the Life Cycle Assessment methodology how the design influences the environmental impact of overlapped purlins. The paper assesses the impact of higher-grade steels versus more traditionally used steel grades. Furthermore, the adoption of steel manufactured using a high content of scrap steel and energy obtained from renewable sources facilitate the reduction of the carbon footprint of the element. Using advanced finite element models, previously validated against experimental results, the purlin systems were designed to support both gravity and pressure loads. © The Author(s) 2024."

However, the carbon footprint estimation of the products requires material and manufacturing information that is typically not available at the early design stage. In this study, a novel method is proposed for carbon footprint estimation, which can evaluate the carbon footprint through the shape recognition of computer aided design (CAD) models based on the graph deep learning. The learning model utilizes the boundary representation of CAD models for deeper understandings of the CAD model shape. The proposed method trains the deep learning model on the existing CAD models to recognize important sub-shapes and attributes, including materials and manufacturing information, such as welded parts, which are the essential data for the carbon footprint estimation. The proposed method enables the designers to estimate the carbon footprint without the laborious condition setting, which facilitates concurrent monitoring and improvement of the carbon footprint. The method is applied to actual assembly models and demonstrated that the material and welded parts, which are attributes required for emission prediction, can be recognized with an accuracy of more than 80%. © 2024 The Author(s)."

There is an interest in exploring various agricultural by-products as effective aggregates for filling framed timber structures. Natural fibers, such as hemp shives, are gaining attention for their environmental benefits, including biodegradability, renewability, recyclability, composability, and their potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. By harnessing these natural fibers, it is possible to reduce emissions associated with the most popular wall structures. Moreover, this approach reduces agricultural waste and facilitates integration into a circular economy model. This study delves into the effects of bio-composites created from hemp shives, combined with starch, gypsum, and a geopolymer binder, in fabricating lightweight timber structures. These lightweight structures are compared among themselves and conventionally used wall structures, assuming one square meter of wall with a specific U-value as the comparative unit. Results from a life cycle assessment revealed that these innovative lightweight timber wall structures yield CO2 emissions ranging from −13.94 to 82.89 kg of CO2 equivalent per square meter. In contrast, compared to traditional brick wall constructions, these structures offer substantial savings, potentially reducing emissions by up to 149.38 kg of CO2 equivalent per square meter.

However, these strategies lack specific carbon footprint targets for plastics used in various applications. This study focuses on plastics in the automotive industry, establishing specific carbon footprint goals for plastics used in passenger cars. It also examines mechanical recycling's role and the share of secondary plastics in meeting these absolute targets. The analysis of mechanical recycling technology reveals that even with 100% recycled plastics, the carbon footprint targets aren't achieved due to high process energy consumption. Investigating grid emission factors, results show that meeting targets requires emission factors lower than 0.13 kgCO2-eq./kWh. Despite successful scenarios, it's presently infeasible to use 100% recycled plastics in passenger car production. This necessitates the need to further improve plastic recycling technologies and increase the share of secondary plastics used in passenger car production. © 2024 The Author(s)."

This information is necessary for the changing paradigm of climate-smart agriculture with less carbon footprint. The decreasing trends in water availability, agricultural area and productivity, and negative changes in agricultural land use patterns make agriculture, especially fruit and vegetable cultivation in peri-urban areas of Hyderabad city, in India, highly vulnerable to climatic variations. Hence a study was contemplated to develop a methodological framework to study the changes in land, water and energy use and their impact on GHG emissions and, thereby, on agricultural production and productivity. Variations in GHG emissions and carbon credit in the identified peri-urban sites were calculated using the accounting framework with respect to changes in land use and energy usage. © (2024), (Indian Academy of Sciences).

The scale of the environment challenge, with climate change issues as its essential part, usually implies that countries and organizations are treated as the key actors whose influence on climate regulation is significant. Meanwhile, in recent years, scholars and experts pay increasing attention to citizen behavior change. On the personal level, behavior change goals may involve the measures for reducing carbon footprint, as well as pressure on policymakers to encourage climate regulations. The purpose of this article is to assess the current role of citizens (their awareness, attitudes to climate change, and willingness to act) in global climate policy. Our theoretical framework is the theory of collective action and its modifications. We highlight the peculiarities of collective action to counteract climate change, as well as complementary approaches which represent the solution of the “social dilemma” regarding environmental protection from different perspectives. Approaches to citizen engagement in climate change adaptation may vary (instrumental, polycentric, ethical). We found that currently the instrumental approach is being implemented. Our results show that currently citizens’ readiness for collective action on climate change issues is not high. We also found a wide variance across countries and their groups in terms of citizen engagement, and a rather intensive application of behavioral economics tools. We conclude that the role of citizens’ collective action in climate policy implementation addresses such underlying concerns as ethical responsibility towards environmental sustainability and public attention to environmental issues on different levels of the economy. © М.В.

This necessity often collides with the production costs. A different design strategy based on a multi-material approach can result in an economic efficiency playing, at the same time, a fundamental role in reducing the environmental footprint. Taking into account this scenario, an optimisation study was proposed focusing on the minimisation of both costs and environmental impacts of a car's lead anti-intrusion side door inside beam (SDIB) manufactured using a multi-material approach. The materials takeable into account in the executed design strategy were a carbon steel, an aluminium alloy, and a carbon fibre reinforced polymer. The objective of the work was to find a balance between cost efficiency and environmental sustainability throughout the entire product life cycle. Specifically, the input variables in the optimisation analysis were energy consumption, CO2 emissions, resource use and direct production costs. The model was developed taking these multiple factors into account and making possible the minimisation of costs and environmental impact, simultaneously respecting, at the same time, the required product performance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V..

This study discusses SSCM practices in one of the FMCG companies, namely PT XYZ, and focuses on sustainable packaging supply chains, intending to know the application of SSCM in the supply chain and improvements that can be made to reduce waste and its negative impacts. The exploratory research was done with a case study type and used a mixed-method approach to formulate the development that can be done to reduce the waste and negative impact of the packaging supply chain. The assessment resulted from calculating the Life Cycle Assessment software, Simapro, with the CML-IA baseline V3.06/EU25 method. This method represents the environmental impact using 11 indicators. The most significant adverse environmental impacts are global warming, human toxicity, and marine aquatic ecotoxicity. The most significant contribution to the cause of the negative environmental impact is the consumption of electricity and water, which produce excess CO2 and boiler engines which produce excess NO2. Improvements can be made by reducing CO2 gas and using alternative fuels for environmentally friendly boilers. © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V."

Uncontrolled combustion produces Rice Husk Ash (RHA) containing high unburnt carbon which acts as a stumbling block in its utilisation as a binary binder in cement. In this regard, RHA was obtained by controlled burning of rice husks in an industry set up. Further, thermo-mechanical beneficiation of the obtained RHA was done in order to make it compliant with the Indian and American codal guidelines. Physical, chemical and mineralogical characterisation of both the as-received and the beneficiated RHAs was performed. The results indicate that re-burning of RHA in the temperature range of 600–700 ºC can be performed to reduce Loss-On-Ignition (LOI) below 5% without compromising the amorphous mineralogy of ash. Further, pozzolanic reactivity of the thermo-mechanically beneficiated RHA exhibited higher value compared to the pozzolanic reactivity of as-received RHA. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024."

Their recycling is difficult because they are predominantly manufactured from thermosetting matrices that are not suitable for secondary processing. Only few technologies are able to target full-scale utilization of residual mechanical performance at recycling, with the replacement of gravel in asphalt concrete being one of them. The possibility of introducing crushed GFRP (GFRP crumb) into asphalt concrete and its impact on mechanical characteristics have been investigated in our study. As the source of GFRP, road noise-protection fence was chosen due to large quantities of its waste accumulated in urban economy. Several approaches to produce crumbs were attempted with only shredding being successful. The GFRP crumb has provided excellent mechanical performance of asphalt concrete fabricated by standard routine. In particular, the improvement in compressive modulus was 40%, even under conditions of elevated asphalt concrete temperature at 50 °C. Besides, introduction of GFRP crumb reduced the overall weight of asphalt concrete mixture, providing further reduction of a carbon footprint. The results obtained indicated that recycling of GFRP waste as replacement of gravel in asphalt concrete provides an economically and environmentally safe solution. © 2024 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.

Data transparency platforms and Digital Product Passports (DPPs) have been proposed as potential solutions sharing products specific information along the value chain, including environmental impacts like the carbon footprint, as e.g. demanded by the upcoming EU Batteries Regulation. For the calculation of environmental impacts, the methodology of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a recognized international standard, the complex implementation of which must now be transferred into DPPs. Therefore, this study analyses the requirements of all stakeholder groups regarding the integration of LCA in data transparency platforms based on the use case of batteries. The identification of these requirements is achieved through a comprehensive literature review. The requirements are then categorized as related to the individual phases of an LCA, secondary data usage as well as data exchange options. Finally, potential areas of conflict regarding the integration of LCA into DPPs are discussed, and further areas of research are highlighted. Efforts should be made to ensure that the workload for companies is minimized while at the same time providing incentives to reduce environmental impacts and create further added value. © 2024 Elsevier B.V..

While the political sphere appears to take the lead in the pursuit of a greener world from a societal standpoint, industries play a pivotal role in implementing innovative technologies. Certain industries, however, still heavily rely on natural gas consumption for their operations. Metal manufacturers, in particular, face significant energy demands due to their melting processes, which have historically necessitated the use of combustion. This paper focuses on examining the current workflow of secondary aluminum manufacturing, with a specific emphasis on rolled sheet production. By analyzing combustion intensive equipment involved in the process, the paper identifies inherent deficiencies and energy losses throughout the production process and propose strategies that can effectively reduce the industry's global carbon footprint. Results show that optimizing work flow to retain embodied energy and heat of intermediate products, as well as smart waste heat reuse can result in significant savings in secondary aluminum manufacturing. © 2024 Elsevier B.V..

Regulations, goals and social responsibilities have reoriented businesses' priorities towards sustainable practices. The life cycle assessment (LCA) carried out in this study measured and compared significant efforts affecting the sustainability of plastic cosmetic packaging. Evaluations were conducted on the life cycle environmental effects of dematerialisation, recycled content, renewable energy share powering the manufacturing processes, energy-saving efforts, and end-of-life (EoL) recycling rates across various scenarios. Consideration was also given to different types of fossil and bio-based polymers (ABS, PP, PET and PLA). Dematerialisation and recycled content were identified as having the most significant positive effects on packaging sustainability. An average net reduction of 52% in the total carbon footprint for all materials assessed was noted when 100% recycling material was applied. The overall impact was reduced by an average of 13% when using 100% solar photovoltaic energy sources in the manufacturing processes. The minimal contribution of the manufacturing stage to the overall impact, compared to the other life cycle stages, was the main attribute causing this comparatively low impact reduction. Furthermore, compared to the other case scenarios, it was determined that polypropylene (PP) was found to have the most favourable environmental impact. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved."

In response, the country started importing more fossil energy including coal, oil, and natural gas to fill the energy gap. However, this led to a significant increase in carbon emissions, hindering the efforts to reduce its carbon footprint. In the current situation, Japan is actively working to balance its energy requirements with environmental considerations, including the utilization of hydrogen fuel. Therefore, this paper aims to explore the feasibility and implications of using hydrogen power plants as a means to reduce emissions, and this analysis will be conducted using the energy modeling of the MARKAL-TIMES Japan framework. The hydrogen scenario (HS) is assumed with the extensive integration of hydrogen into the power generation sector, supported by a hydrogen import scheme. Additionally, this scenario will be compared with the Business as Usual (BAU) scenario. The results showed that the generation capacities of the BAU and HS scenarios have significantly different primary energy supplies. The BAU scenario is highly dependent on fossil fuels, while the HS scenario integrates hydrogen contribution along with an increase in renewable energy, reaching a peak contribution of 2,160 PJ in 2050. In the HS scenario, the target of reducing CO2 emissions by 80% is achieved through significant hydrogen penetration. By 2050, the total CO2 emissions are estimated to be 939 million tons for the BAU scenario and 261 million tons for the Hydrogen scenario. In addition, the contribution of hydrogen to electricity generation is expected to be 153 TWh, smaller than PV and wind power. © 2024, Tech Science Press. All rights reserved."

In addition to the economic benefits, reducing consumption also reduces the carbon footprint of production. While reducing consumption by changing mechanical structures and restructuring production lines can be beneficial, it reduces the versatility of robotic workplaces and is time-consuming. Our proposed solution reduces the energy consumption of the robotic workstation based on the optimal placement of the work object in the robotic cell. In this case, the optimization process is simulated on an industrial robot software platform. The result of the optimization is the determination of the most energy-optimal position for the placement of the work object.

However, their usage is associated with significant environmental impacts, deriving from the constituent materials (e.g., carbon fiber and epoxy resin) and the manufacturing process. Traditional methods of composite manufacturing such as bag molding or compression molding were subjected to discussion due to their high energy requirements, related to the required heat and pressure, the use of molds and the production of composite scraps. In contrast, 3D printing presents a promising alternative, that could reduce material waste and energy consumption. This study investigates an innovative 3D printing process for high-performance composites, in particular continuous carbon fiber and thermosetting epoxy matrix, with the aim of investigating its environmental impact. A comprehensive Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was conducted to compare the environmental footprints of traditional molding and 3D printing processes of continuous fiber composites. A wide range of factors such as energy consumption, resource utilization, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste generation was considered. The outcomes of this comparative LCA reveal a significant reduction in environmental impacts associated with the innovative 3D printing system with respect to traditional methods. These findings offer crucial insights into the sustainability of 3D printing for high-performance composites, providing a valuable decision-making tool for industries seeking eco-friendly manufacturing solutions.. © 2024 Elsevier B.V..

Thus, the pursuit of mass optimization has gained popularity to cut costs and lower energy usage. Notably, the railway bogie, a crucial component of a railway coach, accounts for more than a third of the coach's mass. Consequently, reducing the weight of the bogie can yield substantial reductions in the overall mass of the railway coach. Therefore, the utilization of materials with relatively higher performance-to-weight ratios, such as Carbon and Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymers (CFRPs/GFRPs), holds immense potential for mass reduction. However, it's crucial to adopt a holistic perspective when evaluating the energy consumption and environmental footprint of a structure due to the energy intensive nature of CFRP materials. In this research, we assess the environmental impact of a light-weight composite bogie frame using a Predictive Life-Cycle Assessment (PLCA) methodology. The impact category chosen for this cradle-to-grave assessment is the Cumulative Energy Demand (CED), with a special emphasis on evaluating the energy consumption during the EOL phase. The CED of the frame is evaluated over its service life with a comparison being made with a conventional metallic frame. The results show that using GFRPs in the composite side beam reduces the CED by approximately 25%. The break-even analysis performed showed that the steel structure has a lower energy consumption below a service life of 1,794,000 kms as compared to the GFRP side-beam manufactured by manual processes. © 2024 The Author(s)."

544,The Impacts of Industrial Safety on Environmental Sustainability in Human-Robot-Collaboration within Industry 5.0,Conference paper,Bonello A.; Refalo P.; Francalanza E.,Procedia CIRP,122.0,2024,282,287,10.1016/j.procir.2024.01.041,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193468239&doi=10.1016%2fj.procir.2024.01.041&partnerID=40&md5=72381f4632f27f542a47f645558ee0d9,22128271,Scopus,cognitive safety; collaborative robots; dematerialisation; DfES; environment; Industry 5.0; life cycle,"As the Industry 5.0 paradigm evolves to the forefront of research directions, a dissonance emerges between smart and sustainable elements. This stems from the misbalance of priorities appointed during the engineering design process. Selection of technology driven features, such as collaborative robots and IoT devices are often implemented at the expense of other criteria such as environmental sustainability. This observation is investigated on a workstation designed for human-robot collaboration (HRC), but with limited regard to the energy consumption and carbon footprint incurred during its life cycle. Consequently, this research work attempts to understand the consequences of design decisions for HRC safety (physical and cognitive) on environmental sustainability. The impacts of various HRC workstation scenarios (including various safety features and components) are evaluated using environmental metrics while Design for Environmental Sustainability (DfES) is adopted to close the rift between safety and sustainability. This work uses material substitution and dematerialisation to compensate for the negative impacts resulting from smart HRC features, achieving a reduction of 10 % in both energy consumption and carbon footprint when compared to the same workstation not having undergone the DfES exercise. This paves the way for academia and industrial designers seeking to strike a balance between human-centric and environmentally sustainable HRC. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved."

Existing approaches for measuring resource consumption calculate key performance indicators, such as the carbon footprint, from which actions can be derived. The data acquisition, processing, and visualization are usually complex and individually adapted to the products and production machines. This paper presents a method to capture the resource consumption of a product and production machine with low effort and in a targeted manner to calculate the carbon footprint subsequently. The approach's novelty lies in linking any sensor technology with a cross-platform application, integrating existing data sets, and incorporating gamification techniques. Gamifying the process, users engage more with the data, leading to higher awareness and deeper insights. The application offers an intuitive user interface displaying resource consumption by calculating the environmental impact of the production. The live data integration allows for immediate monitoring of the effect of adaptions to the production process, that helps to create a better understanding of contributions to resource consumption. The use of the application is highlighted in a case study of industrial complexity. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved."

The current paper addresses this issue by optimizing the milling of copper slag, recognized as a promising alternative resource within the construction sector. The slag was milled in a stirred mill using stainless-steel (SS), carbon-steel, and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) balls with(out) grinding aid (GA). The milling time and energy, besides milled slag properties, were monitored. Performance variations of different milling balls were explained through the impact theory. Results show that efficient size reduction happens in the first hours regardless of the ball material and diameter. In a specific surface area (SSA) between 3600-3800cm2/g (d50=11μm), substituting SS with YSZ balls decreased milling time and energy by ∼50%, comparable to processes performed with GA. The addition of smaller balls (∅6.3mm) to bigger balls (∅9.5mm) caused energy consumption to decrease starting from SSA=3200±100cm2/g and cumulative particle size to slightly reduce. The effect of the ball-to-slag ratio on the milling efficiency was found stronger than the ball diameter change. A strong influence of the parameter optimization on the ball milling efficiency was proposed, potentially benefiting powder production industries. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved."

They are gaining significant attention as potential alternatives to traditional thermosets in composite manufacturing due to their repairability and reprocessability. This study explores the environmental sustainability of vitrimers in composite materials through a comprehensive Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach. The research focuses on vitrimer composite parts production and their recycling process, with a ""from cradle to grave approach"". Given the scientific and industrial interest, vitrimer containing disulfide bonds obtained reacting bisphenol A and 4-aminophenyl disulfide (4-AFD or APD) was considered as matrix for the investigated composite part; a traditional epoxy resin matrix composite reinforced with carbon fibers was selected as reference scenario. The recycling process of vitrimer based composites was evaluated, comparing it with conventional thermoset composite recycling method (mechanical recycling). The effects on the environment of these alternatives were evaluated considering different impact categories to provide a comprehensive view of the scenarios. The findings of this study demonstrate that vitrimers can represent a sustainable alternative to traditional thermoset, especially thanks to the possibility of extending the life cycle of a component and recovering continuous filaments from the parts. By shedding light on the potential benefits of vitrimers in reducing the ecological footprint of composite materials, this study contributes valuable insights to sustainable materials development. © 2024 The Author(s)."

Its production liberates enormous quantities of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere which tends to increment in levels of greenhouse gases and hence contributes to global warming. Further, the rapid growth of industries to meet the necessities has a major impact on the generation of quantities of waste byproducts. In order to decline these environmental footprints, many researchers employed waste byproducts as an alternative material to cement and other natural/raw materials. Many studies employed different waste byproducts lonely in the production of geopolymer concrete (GPC) and reported different success rates. However, a combination of different waste byproducts may offer better results and their relative studies are comparatively less. To address the same, the current study evaluates the performance of self-compacting GPC made from fly ash (FA), ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS), and alkali activators. The test results revealed that the strength characteristics tend to decline with the increase in FA contents. The maximum compressive and split tensile strength of 55.1 and 5 MPa, respectively, were obtained at optimum contents of 10 M NaOH, 50% FA, and GGBFS with a curing period of 28 days. Hence the measured values are a little lower than the OPC values, and this optimum content can be employed as a replacement for conventional concrete in general construction activities. Such kinds of studies are in need of hours to comprehend the better utility of multiple waste byproducts in the production of effective GPC mixes. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024."

In NLP, performing pre-training on Transformer models requires significant computational resources. This pre-training involves using a large amount of text data to gain prior knowledge for performing downstream tasks. Thus, it is important that we select the correct data in the form of domain-specific data from this vast corpus to achieve optimum results aligned with our domain-specific tasks. While training on large unsupervised data is expensive, it can be optimized by performing a data selection step before pretraining. Selecting important data reduces the space overhead and the substantial amount of time required to pre-train the model while maintaining constant accuracy. We investigate the existing selection strategies and propose our own domain-adaptive data selection method - TextGram - that effectively selects essential data from large corpora. We compare and evaluate the results of finetuned models for text classification task with and without data selection. We show that the proposed strategy works better compared to other selection methods. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."

It also improves the strength development and long-term durability of concrete without reinforcement. Given the fact that reinforcement concrete is most widely used in construction and building fields, the carbon sequestration potential will be enhanced remarkably if this curing technology can be used in reinforced concrete. However, the impacts of early CO2 curing on the corrosion behavior of steels, which is the major concern for reinforced concrete exposure to chloride, is unclear yet. In this work, the permeability of chloride, threshold chloride value and corrosion behaviors of steels in cement mortar were determined to comprehensively study the effect of early CO2 curing on the chloride induced corrosion of steels. Early CO2 curing lowers the chloride ions permeability of mortars, in particular for the mortars with 28 day curing ages. Steels take longer time to form stable passive films in early CO2-cured mortar than in conventional moist-cured ones. Early CO2 curing reduces the chloride threshold concentration of mortar, in particular for the mortars that the whole cross section is carbonated, the reduction reaches ∼50%. However, it exerts few effects on corrosion induction phase of steel rebar. Moreover, early CO2 curing decreases the corrosion rate of steel bars in corrosion propagation phase and thus the overall corrosion rate of steels during the whole testing process due to slower chloride ingress rate. Thus, early CO2 curing can act as an alternative curing technique in the production of pre-cast reinforced concrete exposed to chloride. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

The review assesses the current understanding of the carbon footprint of green concrete liners and the key factors that affect the carbon footprint, including the materials and production processes used to manufacture these liners. The review is based on a systematic literature search, which identified and reviewed a total of 28 papers. The papers included studies that examined the carbon footprint of green concrete liners from the cradle-to-gate stage and from the cradle-to-grave stage. The review also identified potential areas for further research in order to improve the current understanding of the carbon footprint of green concrete liners. The results from the review indicate that the carbon footprint of green concrete liners depends on the materials used, their production process, and their service life. Furthermore, the review revealed that the current research on the carbon footprint of green concrete liners is limited, and further research focusing on the service life and the end-of-life stage of these liners is needed in order to develop a robust assessment of the carbon footprint of green concrete liners. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024."

Unfortunately, the large-scale production of cement is a major contributor to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, primarily from the manufacturing process and the consumption of fossil fuels. This not only incurs environmental costs associated with global warming but also depletes vital limestone deposits. To mitigate these issues, this study aims to explore the optimal utilization of Guinea Corn Husk Ash (GCHA) and Rice Husk Ash (RHA) in concrete. This research investigated the chemical properties of GCHA and RHA, and their impact on the compressive and split-tensile strengths of concrete when integrated in various proportions. The study reveals that both GCHA and RHA meet the minimum oxide content requirement of 70% set by ASTM C618, with silicon dioxide (SiO2) as the predominant oxide. Increasing the content of RHA and GCHA from 5% to 10% improves the concrete's compressive and split-tensile strengths after curing for 56 days. Optimization results indicate that the ideal mix consists of 10% GCHA, 8.5% RHA, and 82.5% cement, yielding a compressive and split tensile strength of 31.34 N/mm² and 3.07 N/mm² respectively. This study thus offers a promising solution for sustainable concrete production by reducing the environmental footprint of cement while enhancing material properties and promoting an eco-friendlier approach to construction. © 2024 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland."

The amount of water removed by sCO2 is much higher than that expected from solubility considerations alone. Water from gel-type resins is both dissolved by and emulsified in sCO2. Emulsification also occurs in the absence of solids when water alone is contacted by sCO2. It is not a factor for microporous resins where an additional mechanism, viscous fingering, is involved. It appears that bulk water is emulsifiable but not if it is held in pores. Dewatering via viscous fingering has been previously invoked for matrices such as wood and sludge. The resins can be dewatered and dried with sequential batches of sCO2 at sub-boiling temperatures. The CO2 can then be potentially reused after expansion and separation from the entrained water. Partial decompression of the water-laden sCO2 would lead to cooling, which would drop the water solubility substantially. A reduction of temperature from 90 oC to 65oC reduces the solubility of water in sCO2 by a factor of five. The condensed water could then be separated with a hydrocyclone. The footprint of sCO2 is much smaller than the conventional drying process. The energy costs are also much lower because evaporation of water is avoided. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Recent descriptions of microbes incidentally living inside concrete materials (“concrete endoliths”) raised questions about how much carbon is either stored in or released from concrete by these microbes. We generated preliminary global estimates of how much organic carbon is stored within the living biomass of concrete endoliths (biomass-carbon) and much CO2 is released from respiring concrete endoliths. Between 2020–2022, we collected widely varying samples of Portland cement-based concrete from Lubbock, Texas. After quantifying endolith DNA from 25 concrete samples and estimating the current global mass of concrete, we calculated that the global concrete endolith biomass-carbon as low as 5191.9 metric tons (suggesting that endoliths are a negligible part of concrete’s carbon profile) or as high as 1141542.3 tons (suggesting that concrete endoliths are a pool of carbon that could equal or offset some smaller sources of concrete-related carbon emissions). Additionally, we incubated concrete samples in air-tight microcosms and measured changes in the CO2 concentrations within those microcosms. Two out of the ten analyzed samples emitted small amounts of CO2 due to the endoliths. Thus, “concrete respiration” is possible, at least from concrete materials with abundant endolithic microbes. However, the remaining samples showed no reliable respiration signals, indicating that concrete structures often do not harbor enough metabolically active endoliths to cause CO2 emissions. These results are preliminary but show that endoliths may alter the carbon dynamics of solid concrete and, thus, the carbon footprint of the concrete industry. © 2024 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press."

The heating efficiency of a prototype soap bubble insulation system was investigated in a horticultural greenhouse in Northwestern Vermont, USA over two winters. Three greenhouses operated by a commercial grower of ornamental plants were compared: 1) a prototype soap bubble insulation system; 2) a commercially available thermal curtain; 3) an unmodified greenhouse as a control. The greenhouse with the soap bubble system was 29% and 25% more energy efficient than control and energy curtain greenhouses, respectively. These results demonstrate a soap bubble insulation system can reduce heating costs for commercial greenhouse operators in northern climates. This ultimately reduces the carbon footprint associated with greenhouses heated with fossil fuels.

Utilizing the EnergyPLAN tool and market economic simulations, including Levelized Cost of Hydrogen and Net Present Value calculations, the research evaluates the economic viability and environmental impact of transitioning to renewable energy sources by 2030. The analysis explores various scenarios, ranging from dedicated offshore wind for in-turbine hydrogen production to platform-based electricity and hydrogen distribution. Results indicate that integrating offshore wind with green hydrogen production can significantly reduce CO2 emissions and dependency on imported fossil fuels. However, financial viability hinges on supportive mechanisms such as investment subsidies. The study’s findings suggest that achieving economic feasibility requires strategic policy frameworks. This research contributes to the discourse on sustainable energy planning by offering insights into the dynamics of system integration, market economic simulations, and the role of support mechanisms in facilitating the green transition. © 2024, Aalborg University Press.

Carbon emissions caused by the computing needs of machine learning algorithms are becoming a big concern. This is because these models need a lot of computing power and energy. The goal of this paper is to find out how training Neural Machine Translation models affects the environment in terms of carbon footprint and to look into ways to reduce that effect. Machine translation, which automatically translates from source to target, is an area of natural language processing where researchers have been actively working for a long time. The performance of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is enhanced by exploiting Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in its model implementation. However, NMT is highly data-hungry and it requires longer training time. In this paper, an attempt has been made to estimate carbon emission when the different NMT models are trained in low-resource language pairs such as English to Hindi and English to Bengali language pairs on different hardware configurations. Finally, different alternatives have also been suggested to reduce this carbon emission and thereby its adverse impact on the environment can be minimized. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024."

With the geopolitical tensions between the US and China and the invasion of Ukraine, the need for friendshoring supply chains in critical green sectors like electric vehicles (EVs) has become a top concern for the US and other countries in the West. The US is adopting measures to support the production and adoption of EVs with the objective of not just ensuring a low carbon footprint, but purportedly to reduce dependency on ‘countries of concern’, revive its manufacturing sector, and make the supply chain resilient. This has eventually led to a race among the US and other countries to augment the production of EVs. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is the culmination of the efforts to support green transportation of the future while supporting domestic production, deepening economic ties with friends and reducing overreliance on potentially hostile countries.

As the world strives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, construction companies are playing an even bigger role. Green steel is a new concept aimed at reducing the environmental impact of steel production. Traditional methods of steel production rely heavily on fossil fuels, which lead to high carbon emissions. On the other hand, green steel is produced using renewable energy sources such as hydrogen and solar energy, which significantly reduces carbon emissions and overall environmental impacts. Green buildings have an opportunity to tap demand beyond geography and architecture. In fact, greener business models can attract sustainable investments. But by 2030, we can reduce fixed carbon in commercial buildings by 70%. In building construction, the use of green steel can help reduce the carbon footprint of buildings and contribute to the goal of achieving sustainable and environmentally friendly structures. Green steel can be used in a variety of architectural applications such as structural beams and columns, roof covering and cladding and reinforced concrete. Green steel also offers economic benefits such as reduced production costs and increased energy efficiency. With increasing demand for sustainable building materials, the use of green steel is expected to increase, creating new opportunities for the steel industry and promoting a more sustainable future for the building construction sector.

The study shows that conductive heat transfer is responsible for energy consumption and carbon emissions in buildings. The conductive behavior of concrete is modified by using Fly Ash. The study finds that the inclusion of Fly Ash in the mass of cement significantly improves the compressive strength and toughness, and also increases its durability. Fly Ash can be used to partially replace cement and reduce the greenhouse effect, depending on the type of cement used. The paper presents the results of an experiment in which the compressive strength and thermal conductivity of concrete containing different percentages of Fly Ash were tested. The mix proportion was designed as per IS: 10,262–2009/IS: 456–2000 for M25 with OPC replacement by Fly Ash in percentages of 0, 15, 25, and 35. The study finds that the compressive strength of concrete increases up to 15% of Fly Ash, compared to conventional concrete strength whereas the thermal conductivity of concrete increases by the use of Fly Ash. The study concludes that the use of 15% Fly Ash in M25 concrete can improve its mechanical and thermal properties, making it a more sustainable building material that can help in addressing the issue of energy conservation and reducing carbon emissions, thus having significant implications for the building industry in terms of reducing its carbon footprint. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024."

We show that improved water and nutrient efficiency with reduced material inputs, costs, and carbon footprint is achieved with the use of taller and narrower plastic-mulched compact beds [61×30 (width × height in cm), 61×10, 46×30, and 41×30] compared to the wider and shorter conventional bed [76×20] used for growing watermelon. The primary motivation behind the compact bed design is to improve economic and environmental sustainability by reducing the bed width, to increase the fraction of the bed that is wetted by drip irrigation and to reduce the area of farmland covered under plastic. Compact beds were evaluated at two locations in South Florida with different hydrologic settings, using an ensemble of field data (inputs, plant health, yield, soil moisture, and nutrient levels) and a field-verified hydrologic model (HYDRUS). No reduction in yields was observed with compact beds, indicating no production risk for the growers. Compact beds conserve water and reduce deep percolation losses by 6 cm compared to conventional beds, thereby improving water productivity by 20%. Compact beds require less fertilizer (10%-50%) to maintain the same nutrient (N-P-K) concentrations as those in conventional beds because of smaller soil volumes. Reductions in water and fertilizer inputs provide the environmental benefit of reducing nutrient leaching to groundwater, while reduced impervious area reduces runoff losses. Compact beds reduced input (fertilizer, plastic mulch, pesticide, and diesel) costs of the system by US$720/ha and greenhouse gas emissions by 1630 kg CO2e/ha (9%) compared to conventional plasticulture. The annual cost savings create a win-win for farmers to increase profits and/or invest in conservation measures such as precision irrigation. Compact beds offer a climate change mitigation and adaptation strategy for the plasticulture system for watermelon and other similar cucurbit crops (e.g., cucumber, pumpkin, and zucchini).  © 2024 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers."

The anaerobic decomposition of solid wastes in landfills produces biogases such as methane, carbon dioxide and nitrous oxides or commonly termed as Landfill Gases (LFGs). Global warming is caused by both carbon dioxide and methane, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report suggests that methane is more powerful (28 times) than carbon dioxide in terms of global warming potential. With the right equipment, methane has a tremendous potential for energy production, and significant amounts of energy may be recovered from it. In the present research, the most common model for predicting the methane emissions viz a viz LandGEM 3.02 was employed for the unmanaged Tiruppur municipal solid waste. The population estimates were forecasted using the selected growth coefficient for various years during the study period. Biogas generation has increased over time, would continue to rise until 2036, when the maximum amount of biogas was recorded with a production rate of 5.221 × 107 Mg per year. As seen in this study, Tiruppur’s highest productivity occurs one year after closure of the landfills and has huge potential for energy generation. The current research findings can be utilised to develop and measure the capacity of landfill methane extraction systems. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024."

Recently, the increase in global warming and the spread of greenhouse gases have been major concerns. The overuse of fossil fuels poses a major danger to global sustainability. The use of fossil fuels plays an important role in greenhouse gas emissions. Fossil fuels are primarily used in the transportation sector. Road transport plays a critical role in the transportation sector. In this study, carbon dioxide emissions from transport in a specific region were analyzed. Particular emphasis is placed on CO2, one of the most significant greenhouse gases released by the burning offossil fuels, in this context. The amount ofcarbon dioxide emissions from transport in this region, called the Black Sea region, was analyzed from 2013 to 2022. Calculations were performed using the IPCC Tier 1 method, which is one of the methods recommended by the IPCC. As a result, it is seen that the highest carbon dioxide emissions come from diesel fuels. The analysis of the Black Sea region's total carbon dioxide emissions reveals consistent growth in all but 2018 and 2022. In addition, it was determined that the amount of carbon dioxide emissions in the region has gradually increased at an alarming level over the years. © 2024 Society of Automotive Engineers Turkey.

As components get smaller and thinner, humidity-related problems increase since moisture can easily penetrate to critical areas. There are various techniques to prevent moisture ingress during manufacturing and assembly. One of the best methods is to store semiconductor devices in dry storage enclosures (also known as Dry Boxes) between consequent processes and operations. However, since they are typically supplied with Compressed Dry Air (CDA), Dry Boxes tend to be energy intensive. By using an industrial setup at a manufacturing facility in Malta as a case study, an empirical assessment was carried out to investigate the use of Dry Boxes from an energy consumption perspective. The energy performance of Dry Boxes using CDA was compared to that of Dry Boxes using a desiccant-rotor technology. The relative humidity and air temperature inside the Dry Box were monitored in order to assess the behaviour of both technologies with time. An analysis of the Dry Box conditions was conducted to better understand the sources of any existing losses and to identify whether scope for improvement, if any, existed. The study showed that even if the drying technology on the supply side is not changed, improvements on the demand side can have an effective reduction in resource consumption. Using the desiccant rotor instead of CDA to dehumidify the Dry Box did not decrease the energy consumption. However, it was positively concluded that by reducing the infiltration rate and the unoccupied internal volume of the Dry Box, the CDA consumption and hence the energy and carbon footprint of the process decreased by 26%, contributing towards the sustainability goals of the manufacturing industry. © 2024 The Authors.

Autonomous fault detection in pneumatic systems has also been increasingly explored in the last decade, with one of the main objectives being to reduce the energy consumption and resulting carbon footprint of such systems. Nevertheless, pneumatic fault monitoring systems tend to mainly focus on the supply-side, neglecting the demand-side. Studies covering pneumatic fault monitoring on the demand-side, perform research on simple systems, typically investigating the effects on a single actuator or a very small system. This study aimed at tackling this issue, with tests performed on an industrial multi-actuator pick-and-place setup, logging data (i.e. cycle time, flow rate and system pressure) concurrently at two locations within the system. Furthermore, different sized leaks were introduced at three distinct locations, while monitoring their impacts on the system. It was found that with the use of the average, standard deviation and impulse factor of the cycle time and the other two parameters, it was possible to identify the presence of faults on a relatively large system. For instance, the retraction time for one of the actuators reduced by 26% as one of the faults was induced. With modern industrial setups already logging the cycle time and system pressure along the demand-side, this study shows that by using existing equipment, one can develop a reliable fault monitoring system. Such information makes it possible to determine additional fault characteristics, mainly the fault's severity, type and location, thus paving the way towards smart and energy efficient compressed air systems. © 2024 The Authors.

This study utilized a descriptive survey research approach. The 156 participants, which consisted of hotel owners, managers, and employees, were chosen using a stratified random sampling technique using G* power version 3.0. The statistical tools employed were frequency counts, percentages, rankings, averages, standard deviation, and one-way ANOVA. Results revealed that the top five cleaner production technology practices implemented that suggest sustainability were: “modify facilities/equipment”, “adequate proper control operations”, “improves facilities/equipment layout”, “provides training and incentive programs”, and “improves wastes segregation and storage”. The study shows no significant differences observed in the scope of practices for stars 3-5. On the contrary, there is a significant difference seen in the scope of 2- star hotel practices. The use of cleaner production technology and green practices has also decreased the hotel's use of energy, water, and solid waste management. Importantly, the cost of consumption in each hotel unit decreased. The findings of this study will enable hotels to adopt efficient waste sorting techniques, paving the way for a greener transition in the hospitality industry. By doing so, future research, projects, and policy implementations may be directed to a better tomorrow. © 2023 Matt Numer Ofalla; published by UIKTEN.

575,Heat Energy Utilisation on Solar Panels Through Electric Thermal Generators,Article,Garip I.; Khalaf H.H.; Hamdan H.F.; Mohammed B.A.; Hlail S.H.; Al-Majdi K.; Ali A.A.; Al-Tameemi A.R.,International Journal of Renewable Energy Research,14.0,2024,23,30,10.20508/ijrer.v14i1.14769.g8876,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190126940&doi=10.20508%2fijrer.v14i1.14769.g8876&partnerID=40&md5=344d09d4b98f6a646b32ba9589179947,13090127,Scopus,Efficiency; Power; Solar Panel; Solar Radiation; Temperature; Thermoelectric Generator,"Solar energy is clean and renewable, making it a viable option for those seeking to reduce their carbon footprint. These electrons are then converted into electricity, which can be used to power homes, offices, and factories. In this study, heat generated by solar panels will generate electricity by using 10 thermoelectric generators (TEG) type SP1848 27145 arranged in parallel series and attached at the bottom of the panels. A study carried out by the Sun Energy Foundation found that the average power generated by solar panels without TEG is 9.4 W, with an average efficiency of 12.12%, while solar panels with TEG produce 9.22 W, with a potential efficiency of 11.98%. An average TEG produces 23.41 mW of power with a 0.00878% efficiency. As a result of the relatively small temperature difference between the hot and cold sides of the TEG, the efficiency produced is very small. The temperature difference between the hot and cold sides of the TEG averages 4.35°c. A heatsink is the only heat dissipator on the cold side of the TEG, and airflow is the only natural coolant, resulting in insufficient heat dissipation by the heatsink. The temperature that occurs on the hot side of the TEG depends solely on solar radiation for the heat to be generated, so the temperature on the hot side of the TEG is not too high. The solar energy is a clean and renewable source of power, which is essential for reducing our carbon footprint. This study investigated the use of thermoelectric generators (TEG) to harness additional electricity from solar panels. While the TEG system showed promise, it had relatively low efficiency due to the limited temperature difference between the hot and cold sides of the TEG. The study highlighted the importance of efficient heat dissipation and the need for further research to optimize TEG performance in solar energy applications. © (2024), (International Journal of Renewable Energy Research).

This has led to a growing need for energy sources that are both sustainable and environmentally friendly. Solar power has emerged as a popular option for generating electricity but has challenges. One of the biggest problems facing solar panels is dust and other garbage buildup, which can reduce their efficiency and output. While keeping solar panels clean around the clock is difficult, automated detection and cleaning systems can help. In this paper, we propose an image processing-based approach that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) with the popular AlexNet architecture to detect dust on solar panels. Our model achieved an 85% recognition rate for dust detection, which could significantly improve solar panel efficiency. By automating the detection and cleaning process, we can maximize electricity generation and make solar power a viable option for sustainable energy production. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024."

The proposed charging station is equipped with a solar system to charge three distinct types of EV batteries. Modified incremental conduction algorithm is implemented to extract maximum power from the PV panel. If the generation from PV is more than excessive power, it can be sent back to the grid. This increases the grid’s stability during high load demand. In this paper, power balancing between the solar PV system, grid, and battery chargers has been achieved during the different charging conditions. Due to the insertion of many power electronics converters, the grid current is distorted and offers a low power factor. In the proposed work overall control technique is developed to maintain an almost unity power factor and total harmonic distortion is under the limit given by IEEE Standard 519-2014.

The golden standard for reporting CO2 emissions is based on the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol and its scopes 1, 2, and 3. However, as a producer of purely digital products, the software industry differs from traditional industries in its carbon footprint. The software industry value chain relies heavily on an infrastructure that can contribute most of its emissions. It has been recognized that there is a need for an industry-customized carbon emissions model that considers the software industry's peculiarities. The primary goal of this study is to define the main sources of climate impacts in the software industry and propose a model of the GHG Protocol adaptation to software companies. This research has been done in our Green ICT project and is based on interviews done in that project. The data for this research was collected from five software companies with different demographics and business models. The interviews, with a total amount of 14, were conducted between November 2022 and March 2023 during a service design process of an automated tool that facilitates green transition in software companies. The analysis of the interviews was supplemented with the results from four multi-stakeholder workshops conducted during the service design process, as well as with the analysis of a series of webinars around the topic. As a result of the study, the Software Company Scopes model for the primary sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the software company and its value chain was created, and the GHG Protocol was tailored to the needs of the software industry. Thus, considering its industry-specific peculiarities, we may conclude that the GHG Protocol can be applied to the software industry. © The Author(s) 2024."

The pulp and paper industry has been responsible for direct industrial carbon emissions. This industry being the largest user of original or virgin wood imposes a direct effect on local flora and fauna as well as the aquatic economy. Thus, there is a need for making this industry more environmentally sustainable. Moreover, India aims to achieve a net-zero carbon emissions target by 2070. Thus, in this study, the focus lies on selecting sustainable suppliers for the pulp and paper industry in turn controlling carbon emissions. This study has several criteria to be considered, one of the most important being the carbon emissions. Each criterion is categorised as Beneficial and Non-beneficial. The beneficial criteria are Service Quality and Quality. While, the non-beneficial are Lead time, Price and Carbon Emissions. Multi-Criteria decision making (MCDM) plays an important role in the sustainable supplier selection process. Here, TOPSIS, VIKOR and COPRAS are the MCDM methods which are used further in this paper. The findings from the three methods shows that the supplier with the highest ranks has low Carbon Emissions and smallest ranks are for suppliers with higher emissions. The higher emission group of suppliers need to measure, manage and reduce carbon foot prints. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."

Given advancements in transportation technology, customers’ willingness to reduce carbon footprints, as well as policy incentives, Electric Vehicles (EVs) are becoming an increasingly important part of the passenger vehicle industry. Evaluation of Supply Chain (SC) performance in the EV industry seems to contribute significantly to the enhancement of the operational consequences across the supply chain tiers. The SCOR (Supply Chain Operations Reference) model was designed to help businesses optimize their supply chain operations, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction. Although many performance measurement models have been developed in the context of SC, there is no performance measurement model in relation to the EV supply chain based on indicators of customer perceived value (Reliability, Responsiveness and Agility) in the SCOR model. Therefore, we aimed to develop a new method to evaluate the performance of the EV supply chain using a set of critical SC performance evaluation indicators. Multi-criteria decision-making along with machine learning was used in order to develop a new method for evaluating SC performance. We used k-means clustering and fuzzy logic approaches in the development of the new method. An assessment of indicators’ importance level was performed using the fuzzy logic approach. The results of the method evaluation show that the proposed method is capable of predicting the performance of the EV supply chain accurately. According to the results, by optimizing their supply chain, companies can improve their ability to deliver products and services that meet or exceed customer expectations, resulting in higher customer perceived value and customer satisfaction. © 2024 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press."

Secondary aluminium alloys have a twenty times lower carbon footprint than primary metals, leading to significant CO2 savings. Their properties can satisfy engineering targets through optimized product design. Adopting a smart system layout, in which functions are assigned to assemblies, some of the low‐end mechanical properties of secondary alloys can be offset. Design for easy disassembling can then guarantee a selective re‐purposing and, finally, an environmentally friendly recycling of components. Innovative products in this field have been developed and successfully produced by means of an optimized high-pressure die casting (HPDC) technology, adopting low carbon footprint raw materials supplied in alternative to ingot format. In this study, a housing component for an e-mobility module battery was manufactured using EN AC 46000 alloy (AlSi9Cu3(Fe)), sourced from automotive industry scraps. The selected scraps were melted and cast to form the battery housing. Consequently, both the initial scraps and the resulting components underwent comprehensive analysis to evaluate the alloy's quality. Chemical analyses, hardness tests, and microstructural observations were performed. The findings confirm a refined and high-quality microstructure in the casting, affirming the viability of producing battery housing through High-Pressure Die Casting (HPDC) using exclusively recycled alloy. © 2024, Technical University of Kosice.

One of the tools for implementing pro-environmental policy aimed at reducing the share of greenhouse gas emissions by the transport sector is the replacement of the combustion engine with an electric drive. Electric vehicles have a much smaller carbon footprint and are much less energy-intensive than combustion vehicles. However, a wider scale of use of electric vehicles in the realities of modern economies is determined by the charging stations infrastructure, characterised by specific features that can ensure smooth and uninterrupted operation of the BEV vehicle. The purpose of the article is to identify the development trends in charging stations infrastructure in Poland. Based on data characterising the current state of development of charging stations infrastructure in Poland, a diagnosis of its development trends was made, along with an attempt to identify potential threats. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."

Sand is expensive and is a non-renewable natural resource. To replace sand in bioretention media will not only reduce the construction cost, but also reduce the carbon footprint. Additionally, the use of sand-based media presents challenges for landscape architects in terms of plant variety and aesthetics. This leads to designers and landscape architects to avoid sand-based media or reduce the proportion of sand in the media, which makes the bioretention system underperform during storms. In order to address these concerns while still adhering to hydrology and pollutants removal requirements, we have developed a granule media made from excavated soil. The process involves drying the native soil to around 40% of its weight, crushing and screening it into particles smaller than 2 mm, and using an environmentally friendly adhesive to pelletize the fine particles using disk granule machines. The resulting granules can be soaked in water for years without dispersing. The media has a porosity of over 40% and an infiltration rate ranging from 200 mm to 2000 mm per hour, depending on the size of caithe granules. We have tested popular plants in this media and found that their health is not significantly different from plants grown in regular soil. The media also exhibits impressive removal rates for COD, TP, NH3-N, and TN, ranging from 20% to 90% depending on the configuration. Detailed findings from both lab and field studies will be presented in the paper. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024."

The urban transport situation is as precarious as in the rural transport. Due to population growth and urban sprawl, there is rural-urban drift which has brough about an increase in the number of urban centres across the globe and coupled with the high dependence on fossil fuel, this has led to the continuous growth of air pollution and Green House Gas (GHG) emission level. Such pollution level has serious health effects and sometimes led to several death and contributes to climate change. Vehicular emissions are one of the major pollutant’s sources today with road transport as the key source of the PM2.5 pollution in large cities across the globe. This is due to several reasons including high vehicle density, old emission control technologies, fuels’ high Sulphur content, and limited public transportation options. Clean mobility will help to cut down on health cost and premature death due to air pollution, mitigate climate change actions and economic impacts of mobility. This paper will discuss issues such as stakeholder analysis on existing mobility systems and how to make it clean, policy framework and guidelines and public private partnership in the mobility sector. Therefore, the government in partnership with the private sector and multilateral agencies would have to invest in sustainable modern electric trains, Electric Mobility systems, build ports near deep rivers and create more local and international airports, and ensure people can afford to use them as well as explore the use of alternative fuel with less pollutants and reduced impact on the climate such as natural gas and hydrogen (green, blue, grey) as the case may be. © 2024 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland."

Renewable energy transition (ETN) can curb the CF; however, political risk can obstruct this process. Hence, this study analyses the connections between economic growth, ETN and CF by considering political risk and financial expansion in a panel of top 10 emitters from 1992 to 2020 using the method of moment quantile regressions (MM-QR). The results elucidate that ETN significantly reduces the CF in the top emitters. Thus, expanding the ETN is beneficial for reducing the CF and promoting sustainable development. Improving the political environment by reducing the political risk (POLR) helps curb the CF. The inverted U-shaped connection between CF and economic growth shows that increased growth can reduce CF if top emitters can continue to promote energy transition and political stability. The positive impact of financial expansion on CF becomes insignificant at higher quantiles. Finally, policy suggestions are discussed. © 2024 Prague University of Economics and Business.

Within this framework, this study intends to assess the embodied carbon footprint of a typical Moroccan residential three-story building through the calculation of the total cradle-to-gate embodied carbon emissions of the major building materials. Using the life cycle assessment as a tool and Inventory of Carbon & Energy (ICE) as an open-source database, a conventional construction scenario is evaluated, using current construction materials. The results show that cradle-to-gate & replacement embodied carbon amounts to 418.67 kg CO2eq/m2/year over the 100-year operating period of the building. Whereas buildings in Morocco consume a lot of concrete and steel, both of which are carbon-intensive and findings show that they account for around 32,83% of the total emissions. Up to date, there has been no regulation to implement mandatory whole life cycle carbon assessment and promote methods, strategies and practices that encourage the decarbonization of built environment in Morocco. Hence, the findings of this case study intend to shed the light on embodied carbon of typical Moroccan residential building, to encourage the industry and academia to consider the embodied carbon and to learn more about it before legal requirements take place. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024."

Improving the existing Mass Rapid Transit System (MRTS) is a sustainable solution to combat today’s rise in traffic congestion. Transport ecological footprint (TEF) is a tool that determines the impact of the urban infrastructure and transport modes on the environment. This study aims to understand the ecological footprint, that is, physical and energy footprints contributed by the transportation sector throughout the Bangalore Urban District (BUD). The analysis of data shows that the study area with a population of 1.36 million generates about a 1.63 million work/educational trips per day having a prime modal split of 30% for buses, 10% for 4-wheelers (4W), 22% for 2-wheelers (2W), 3% by auto rickshaw, 28% by foot 5% by bicycle and other 2% by train. The physical footprint is estimated to be approximately 7408.8 ha and the energy footprint of all four taluks comprising BUD is 1.095E + 05 ha. Therefore, it is estimated that 9 earths are required to sequester the emissions from transport. In view to reduce emissions, a scenario is proposed with a stated preference survey as Bus Transit, with urban and socio-economic attributes. A binary logit model developed using IBM SPSS software estimates that there is a 95% shift from 2W, 86.35% from auto, and 23% from 4W to bus transport. Thereby reducing the emissions rate by 44% and going down to 4earths to sequester the emissions from transport.

It advances prior investigations into the Hellenic Army's emissions by introducing a comprehensive action plan designed to substantially reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in military production. The plan integrates Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and a precise carbon footprint timeline as essential instruments for continuous monitoring and efficacy assessment. The method for calculating emissions, utilizing 2021 data, adheres to the guidance of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and aligns with Greece's national reporting, ensuring observance of global standards such as ISO 14064. This adherence guarantees the reliability and validity of the study's conclusions. The analysis identifies electricity usage as the primary emission source, contributing 83.7% to the sector's carbon footprint, underscoring the significant environmental influence of energy utilization in military manufacturing. While recognizing the sector's considerable environmental footprint, the research also notes the beneficial impact of Greece's shift to renewable energy, which has led to a notable decrease in emissions. The study underscores the need for precise, industry-specific mitigation tactics, highlighting the military manufacturing sector's capacity for environmental impact reduction. The research not only illuminates the present GHG emission status in the Hellenic Army's manufacturing operations but also charts a definitive, sustainable course of action. The proposed strategic plan, reinforced by KPIs and an emission timeline, represents a balanced approach to ecological responsibility without compromising military production efficiency. This study stands as an exemplar for other industries aiming to reconcile with climate change mitigation objectives effectively. © 2024 by authors, all rights reserved."

The production and use of hydrogen as a renewable energy carrier can play a critical part in reaching these objectives as cities worldwide work to lower their carbon footprint. The main challenge is to identify the most suitable areas for the Green Hydrogen Infrastructure (GHI) location. Several criteria are essential to select these areas to ensure efficient distribution and accessibility. This paper proposes a spatial multi- criteria analysis integrating the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method in the Geographic Information System (GIS) to identify the most suitable locations for hydrogen infrastructure. This approach considers multiple criteria, such as demand, accessibility, environmental impact, and cost. In addition, three different scenarios were analyzed, emphasizing the technical, economic, and environmental criteria. The final result saw the comparison of three different land suitability maps to identify the best sites for plant placement. The GIS component allows for spatial analysis, making it possible to visualize and analyze the spatial relationships between potential locations and other relevant factors. The method is applied to an energy-intensive industry in Matera municipality (Italy). This approach offers suggestions on how urban planners, decision-makers, and other stakeholders may help green hydrogen become developed and used as a sustainable energy source.

Results verify that e-service quality, perceived usefulness of technology, positive E-WOM, perceived ease of use of e-banking service, concern about carbon footprint, and eco-friendly technology have a positive and significant relationship with attitude towards e-banking service. Attitude has also a positive and significant relationship with e-banking adoption during the pandemic. The results show that poor security of financial and personal information negatively moderates the relationship between attitude towards e-banking service and e-banking service adoption. It has further been demonstrated that attitude towards e-banking has mediated the relationship between the independent variables and e-banking adoption, guiding the managers of private commercial banks in countries where e-banking services are still in the primary stage on how they should reorganise their e-banking services to attract new customers for adopting e-banking services.

This encourages us to investigate alternative building materials in order to reduce the energy consumption of buildings. Foam concrete (FC) is one such energy-saving material with special attributes such as low density (400–1850 kg/m3) and excellent insulating characteristics. The main facet of the present study includes investigations on operational energy cost of typical G + 1 bungalow located in the Guwahati city (in Northeastern region of India) for different scenarios of walling materials (FC, autoclaved aerated concrete block (AAC) and clay brick). Experimental outcomes indicated that thermal conductivity of AAC block and FC of density 1000 kg/m3 are found to be very much lower than that of conventional clay brick. Further results on energy simulation analysis showed that building with AAC block (density 660 kg/m3) and FC (density 1000 kg/m3) as walling material exhibited yearly energy consumption of 15,188.24 and 15,608.75 kWh, respectively, which is comparatively lower than that of clay bricks (16,187.13 kWh). Adding to above, use of better insulating walling material also results in reduction of CO2 emission by 53.99 and 31.26 tons for AAC block and FC (density 1000 kg/m3), respectively. The above results highlight that FC can serve as a better energy-efficient alternative to conventional walling material. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024."

Due to the complex characteristics of ports, coordinated and holistic approaches between port authorities and municipalities are of utmost relevance to tackle greenhouse gas emissions reduction. This paper analyses the mobility challenges of a port city and associated carbon dioxide CO2 emissions. The specific objectives of this research are: firstly, to study the implementation of integrated mobility measures in ports to reduce the carbon footprint by promoting an efficient use of transport infrastructure and smart mobility strategies to/from/in the port; secondly, to define and implement electric mobility and digitalization solutions for transport in ports (including the connection between the city and the port). The traffic modelling software PTV VISSIM and the Vehicle Specific Power methodology were used to estimate the emissions of the vehicles present in the road network of a study area. The methodology was applied to the case study of Aveiro, Portugal, which has a port located 8 km from the city centre.

In this paper, comparative cradle-to-grave life cycle assessments between a conventional product and a 3D-printed alternative made of polylactic acid (PLA) and PLA-wood material were investigated based on the standard ISO 14044:2006. The environmental impact of each product was quantified for 18 categories. The goal of life cycle assessment (LCA) was to determine whether the use of 3D printed PLA/PLA-wood products can be a sustainable alternative to traditional metal products. The paper presents a case study in which a comparative LCA was conducted. The results show that a metal part manufactured using conventional subtractive processes (milling, drilling, welding, etc.) has a higher environmental impact compared to 3D-printed alternatives made from renewable materials. However, there are many sub-issues that need to be adequately addressed. © 2024 by the author(s)."

Automotive, industry, and aerospace applications are all concerned with these challenges. The several steps of the manufacturing process must therefore be thoroughly understood and controlled to ensure the right level of targeted parameters at the right cost. For this purpose, studies have dealt with practical examples of such fine-tuning, considering fine metallurgical studies, methodology of controls, from the laboratory stage to the mass production stage. The present study deals with these issues in relation to case-carburized M50NiL steel to find the practical link between research and development and each manufacturing step, with the focus on the core and surface properties of components. In particular, grain size, residual stress profiles, microstructure, and precipitation were investigated due to their impact on the life duration of aerospace bearings. We first conducted a preliminary review of the existing literature containing published and quantitative data regarding the M50NiL grade. Then a test plan was carried out, and the results were analyzed using a thermodynamic approach and a quantitative analysis of precipitation linked to the manufacturing steps. The result was a better understanding of residual stress and core microstructure, making fine-tuning easier to achieve and adapt to customer demands. These results were obtained thanks to the efficient cooperation between metallurgists and manufacturing teams in considering the time to market for new developments.

The use of CO2 injection in concrete (CarbonCure) in the United States and Canada has enabled advances such as green concrete under normal and severe conditions. While incorporating novel developments, this study focuses on CarbonCure concrete modification in the extreme weather of the Arabian Gulf region. This is a relatively new option that has entered the field in the Middle East. The materials, process, and fresh and hardened properties of the CarbonCure concrete made and field cured in the Arabian Gulf region will be considered here and evaluated in detail. Along with adding CO2 to the mix, the cementitious material was lowered without impacting the quality or performance of the structural concrete. The developed green mix included up to 0.2% CO2 by mass of cementitious material. Because of the benefit of early carbonation, which strengthened the concrete product even with less cementitious material, this green concrete mix retained a 28% increase in slump compared to the standard concrete mix without CO2, a 28-day compressive strength of 48 MPa, low water absorption of 1.3%, and resistance to aggressive chemicals, all within the limits defined by the standard codes. Due to these benefits, and because this green concrete was tested against the severe coastal climate, it would be ideal for maritime applications. © 2024 The Author(s).

Building trust between researchers and care teams is essential to this process, which often requires visiting practices to cultivate relationships and perform research activities. However, in a recent study using practice facilitation to improve the delivery of a preventive service, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted us to convert all planned facilitation from an in-person to virtual format. This eliminated the need to commute by automobile to and from practices across the state, greatly reducing the carbon footprint of the study. Methods: From practice facilitator field notes that detailed practice locations and number of sessions, we calculated the total number of driving miles averted by virtual facilitation. We then determined metric tons of carbon dioxide we avoided producing using the Environmental Protection Agency Greenhouse Gases Equivalencies Calculator. During post-intervention interviews, we assessed practices’ perspectives and experiences with the virtual format. Results: Three practice facilitators provided an average of 3.4 sessions for 64 practices. Virtual facilitation averted 32,574.8 drive miles and prevented the release of 12.7 metric tons of carbon dioxide, an offset equivalent to growing 210 trees for 10 years. Practices reported that virtual facilitation fostered greater engagement and allowed more clinicians and staff to attend sessions. Discussion: Climate change poses a significant threat to the health of people and communities. Given their commitment to improving population health, it may be time for PBRNs to routinely assess their environmental impact and minimize preventable environmental costs. © 2024 American Board of Family Medicine.

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a systematic method used for the evaluation of the environmental impacts of a building throughout its entire life cycle, from raw material extraction to disposal at end-of-life stage. Early implementation of LCA principles in the design phase of a project aids stakeholders in the decision making process by allowing targeted interventions by seeking sustainable strategies in material selection. The pursuit of sustainability in LCA applications engenders the possibility for smart buildings – the integration of technology in the building design process, yielding increased levels of performance and efficiency. Smart building initiatives further extend the focus of energy optimization in buildings through utilization of and enhanced operational efficiency throughout a building’s lifecycle.

The methods used for cleaning the exhaust gases cannot completely ensure the processing of carbonaceous emissions. We propose a method of using conversion-type gasifiers for carbon reduction when processing combustion products of exothermic reactions in metallurgical units. Computational fluid dynamics and mathematical modeling are applied to confirm the feasibility of the proposed solution. As part of the scientific problem of decarbonization associated with reducing the carbon footprint, the thermodynamic processes in changing the dust–gas medium composition based on the solution of fundamental principles related to the modification of the Bell–Boudouard equation have been analyzed.

In Ecuador, Cavia porcellus, which was initially domesticated by indigenous populations, is frequently utilized for ensuring food security due to its meat's resemblance to that of rabbit or chicken. Furthermore, small-scale farmers in Ecuador utilise indigenous food resources as supplements due to their capacity to offer bioactive components that yield several advantages for organic reactions. The primary application of Curcuma longa (C.longa) meal is as a feed supplement for Cavia porcellus. Nevertheless, certain investigations have also documented productive, metabolic, or immunological responses. Hence, the objective of this study was to assess the impact of dietary supplementation with C. longa on guinea pigs. Methodology: In this study, a completely randomized design was used to assign 220 mice to four treatments: “Control”, “T1”, “T2”, and “T3”. The assignment of animals to treatments was done randomly. The initial treatment, referred to as “Control”, consisted of a meal comprising 60% concentrate feed. The second treatment, T1, consisted of 0.60% C. longa, T2 consisted of 1.30% C. longa, and T3 consisted of 2.30% C. longa. Results: the amount of feed consumed did not vary amongst the different treatments over the course of the experiment (125 ± 13 g/day, p = 0.32). Nevertheless, the inclusion of 1.30% of C. longa (T2) led to a significant increase in the final body weight (p < 0.001), while T3 exhibited a higher feed conversion ratio (p < 0.001). Therefore, an observation was made about the likelihood of carcass surrender, with a measured tendency (p = 0.08). The T2 group had a greater percentage (77%) compared to the T1 group (72%; p = 0.03) and the T3 group (73%; p = 0.04). Furthermore, the difference was even more significant when compared to the Control treatment group (63%; p = 0.001). Regarding expansion, the serum lipid concentration was significantly lower in the T2 therapy compared to T1, T3, and the Control group (p = 0.001 to 0.023). Conclusions: Thus, including C. longa as a nutritional supplement in animal production appears to be a beneficial alternative to antibiotics, also reducing the production of high carbon footprint products. Similarly, we determined that the inclusion of C. longa flour at a concentration of 1.30% as a dietary supplement effectively regulates the levels of lipids in the blood serum of Guinea pigs. These promising results allow for a comprehensive and advanced range of support studies at immunological levels to validate the bioactive characteristics of C. longa. © 2024 Journal of Natural Science, Biology and Medicine."

This paper proposes the use of courtyards of low-rise buildings for agrivoltaics. This will increase the area for installing photovoltaic systems, which have so far only been installed on roofs or facades or on open fields. The advanced design of the photovoltaic systems will enable the dual use of the area both for the cultivation of crops and for the production of electricity at the same time. The increased amount of electricity produced in photovoltaic systems also contributes to reducing the carbon footprint. On the courtyard as well as on the open fields, it is possible to grow agricultural crops between rows of photovoltaic panels. The partial shading of seedlings during summer sunny days reduces their heat stress and slows down soil drying. Solar eclipses are rare, but their impact on electricity generation is significant. We evaluated the measured data and we assessed the electricity production and the influence of a solar eclipse on the electricity production in photovoltaic power plants in the Czech Republic. The daily loss in production depends on the size of the eclipse. A comparison of the annual electricity production in two selected PV power plants with the expected values according to PVGIS testifies to the quality of the construction and the PV panels used in both power plants.  © 2024 Institute of Agrophysics."

This sequestration is controlled by different soil properties. SCSo, a boon, enhances the physical and chemical conditions of the soil to improve soil drainage and provide adequate nutrition to the plants. SCSi, contributed mainly by pedogenic calcium carbonates (PCs), is a bane and degrades the soil chemically. Soil acts both as a source and sink of carbon. With the global warming threat looming, conservation of the soil for sustenance has gained more importance in view of its role in providing various ecosystem services, including food production. Therefore, identifying climate-smart soils that can withstand climate change and warming is important. These climate-smart soils will help identify global hotspots for soil conservation. The present study provides a method to measure soil carbon footprints (CFs) to identify climate-smart soils, citing a few examples from tropical India. This effort will help move forward the subject of soil carbon research and its importance for preserving this limited natural resource for humankind. Increased atmospheric carbon footprints (CF) are harmful, while those in the subsurface (soil) are good and will continue to save humanity from the vagaries of climate.

Despite the widespread acceptance that local action is essential for achieving low-carbon cities that save non-renewable energy sources, a lack of integration between energy-saving solutions and urban planning continues to hinder the work of local decision-makers, technicians, and practitioners. This study integrates statistics and spatial analysis techniques to investigate the relationships between urban characteristics and residential energy consumption. The study is a first step of wider research which employs a GIS-based methodology on an urban scale to support decision-makers in identifying the most effective urban areas and fields of intervention to reduce urban energy footprint in the face of climate challenges and emerging geopolitical scenarios related to energy supply. The spatial and statistical analysis was based on variables related to key urban characteristics, including socio-economic, physical, functional, and environmental factors.

621,Estimation of canopy height based on multi-source remote sensing data using forest structure aided sample selection,Article,Zhao Y.; Du S.; Li K.; Jiang J.; Guo Q.; Xiao W.,International Journal of Remote Sensing,45.0,2024,2235,2268,10.1080/01431161.2024.2326537,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188346644&doi=10.1080%2f01431161.2024.2326537&partnerID=40&md5=26929c2277f8640edafcc03afe2247fc,01431161,Scopus,canopy height; Forest structure; multi-source LiDAR; stratified sampling,"Forest canopy height data are crucial for estimating forest carbon storage and assessing forest ecology. By utilizing satellite imagery, canopy height data obtained from airborne or spaceborne LiDAR have been expanded from footprint and plot levels to spatially continuous elevation mapping of forests. However, current research suggests that estimating forest canopy height without forest type data presents a challenge in how to effectively integrate multi-source LiDAR data and ensure the samples adequately represent various forest types for higher estimation accuracy. Therefore, this study proposes a forest canopy height estimation method that considers forest structure and integrates multi-source LiDAR data to overcome the challenge. First, a stratified sampling method based on forest structure (SSMFS) was proposed to select training samples and enhance their representativeness. Second, we combined GEDI and ATL08 data to create a multi-source spaceborne LiDAR dataset, enhancing geographic coverage and increasing canopy height samples. Third, the spaceborne LiDAR-based canopy height estimation model incorporates previously unconsidered canopy openness features and uses SSMFS to select training samples. Finally, we improved spaceborne LiDAR canopy height accuracy by creating a residual correction model that adjusts for differences between airborne scanner (ALS) and spaceborne LiDAR estimates. This study, conducted in Zhangwu County, achieved an accuracy of R2 = 0.71, MAE = 1.20 m, and RMSE = 1.71 m. These results show a 51.06% increase in R2, a 26.38% decrease in MAE, and a 24.00% decrease in RMSE compared to recent research. In summary, this study profoundly amplifies predictive accuracy, providing a clear advantage in the delineation of regional forest canopy maps. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Coal bottom ash (CBA) is an ash generated in coal-fed power plants which is landfilled. Existing literature reports the potential of CBA as a replacement for Portland cement (PC) and natural fine aggregates (NFA) in concrete. Carbonation is an important durability parameter of concrete having fatal consequences at later ages if not estimated and controlled as it leads to corrosion in reinforcement. In the present study, experimental, microstructural, and statistical analysis along with life cycle assessment was performed to investigate the combined effect of two-hour grinded CBA (GCBA) as PC (10-30%) and raw CBA as NFA replacement (0-50%) on compressive strength and carbonation resistance. Accelerated carbonation tests were performed at an exposure of four weeks after 28 and 90 days of curing. Among CBA-based concrete mixes, concrete with 20% GCBA and 25% CBA (G20C25) reported higher compressive strength and carbonation depth owing to pozzolanic reactivity and filler effect of fine CBA particles. However, G20C25 resulted in comparable performance in comparison with the control mix in terms of strength and carbonation resistance. The findings of X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy also validate the trends. The mathematical models derived for the carbonation resistance and strength were well-fitted. Multi-objective optimization recommended 21.5% GCBA and 29.8% CBA as the optimum amount that resulted in 20.08% and 19.40% lower carbon footprints and eco-costs compared to control mix.  © 2024 MIM Research Group.

A particularly high-value but challenging application with rapidly growing demand is in the deployment of high-performance computing (HPC) clusters within microgrids. In this work, a model of a HPC cluster in an energy-diverse microgrid is developed to determine the requirements of a technology-agnostic microreactor deployed for such a challenging application. The minute-resolution simulations revealed that the cluster’s electrical load fluctuation of up to 4.1 MW/min required a fast and responsive load-following capability. When the load-following capability of the microreactor was perturbed, the required microgrid storage capacity associated with having a 0.1 MW/min dispatchable microreactor decreased by two orders of magnitude as compared with load-following solely by energy storage devices, indicating that load-following capability in microreactors is of great value in such applications. The analysis methods described in this work can be extended to other microgrids, other HPC clusters, or other types of challenging applications, and can help microgrid planners in determining the storage size, output capacity, and ramping capabilities of the storage devices required for a given microgrid configuration. © 2024 American Nuclear Society."

Business operations are at the heart of decarbonisation, and the reduction and removal of carbon dioxide output from operations is currently a key concern. This study subsequently analyses which energy choices and circular economy (CE) practices have been the most attractive option, along with the overall long-term sustainability of these choices. A facilitated workshop methodology was undertaken with SMEs already using CE principles to improve their sustainability credentials and lowering their carbon footprint. The results led to the identification that solar energy has been chosen as the key focus towards greener energy, with the reduction of materials used in operations as the primary CE practice. These are easier actions that do not disrupt current operations; however, for longer-term sustainability, stronger actions like closing material loops will be needed. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024."

Next, results from a counterfactual policy analysis find that the distributive effects of a carbon tax are regressive in urban areas but not in rural areas, increasing within and between ethnic group inequality in urban China. A carbon tax with revenue-neutral schemes, by contrast, helps to mitigate existing inequalities in society, reducing income- and ethnic-based forms of inequality. Results are robust to machine learning techniques employed to simulate potential heterogeneous household abatement scenarios. The findings emphasize the potential benefits of a carbon tax, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of climate justice and informing policy decisions that promote equitable outcomes for vulnerable segments of society. © 2024 by American Association of Geographers."

This negative footprint illusion is supposedly underpinned by an averaging bias: people base environmental impact estimates not on the total impact of items but on their average. Here, we found that the illusion’s magnitude increased with the addition of a greater number of “green” items when the number of conventional items remained constant (Studies 1 and 2), supporting the averaging-bias account. We challenged this account by testing what happens when the number of items in the conventional and “green” categories vary while holding the ratio between the two categories constant (Study 3). At odds with the averaging-bias account, the magnitude of the illusion increased as the category size increased, revealing a category-size bias, and raising questions about the interplay between these biases in the illusion. © 2024 The Author(s).

One option to make railway transport more available is micromobility, which can replace private car journeys for its flexibility and also can act as a feeder for railway passenger transport. In addition, micromobility, with its near-emission-free operation, can reduce the carbon footprint of general transportation and daily commuting to the work or school. © 2024 Elsevier B.V..

SCGC comprises the benefits of geopolymerization and self-compacting concrete. In this chapter, experimental investigation is done to for understanding the effect of cement and extra water on SCGC properties. Geopolymer concrete is prepared with Industrial-by-products, Fly ash and GGBS as binders in 50:50 proportions, which are activated with alkaline solution. The alkaline solution contains mixture of sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide. The geopolymer concrete is prepared in such a way that it also possesses the properties of self-compacting concrete. Ex. water/cement ratio is chosen according to workability criteria for the mix. Trial mix proportions are developed by considering different molarities of sodium hydroxide concentration. Binder content is kept constant for all mixes. The final mix proportions satisfy the workability requirements of Self compacting geopolymer concrete as mentioned in Indian Standard code IS:10262-2019 and EFNARC guidelines. Standard cubes are casted and tested for compression strength at 28 days. The compressive strengths are in the range of 25–27 N/mm2 in par with conventional concrete with less use of cement content. In addition, SCGC does not require compaction and used in congested reinforcement areas. The outcomes from this study can encourage the usage of SCGC in real-time construction. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

Thus, several billion UHF and HF labels are produced per year. Insofar as the lifespan of these labels is short and therefore can be considered disposable components, it is vital to measure their impact on the environment. This is not only due to the growing concerns about global warming but also to explore alternatives to RFID tags that can help conserve resources and reduce pollution.

Activities such as excessive packaging, delivery, and returns have contributed to increased carbon emissions, resulting in a significant carbon footprint. To promote a sustainable e-commerce environment, a study is needed to assess the carbon footprint contribution of online businesses. This paper presents a framework for conducting a preliminary investigation into the carbon production and emissions of identified e-commerce organizations. The framework was formulated by analyzing the relevant literature from similar studies. It comprises a 3-phase research activity: Phase 1 involves identifying carbon footprint factors through a literature search; Phase 2 includes conducting a case study on an online business to construct a carbon consumption profile; and Phase 3 involves developing a measurement method to assess the carbon consumption of online businesses. The proposed framework can provide a preliminary understanding of e-commerce’s carbon footprint contribution and enable authorities to assess the level of carbon consumption and devise action plans to reduce its impact on the environment.

Nevertheless, despite the green finance index’s (GFI) potential advantages in combating climate change, empirical studies on the subject’s consequences have been few, mostly because of the index’s restricted data availability. This study’s primary goal is to close this gap by employing panel data analysis to investigate the environmental effects of GFI in China between 2004 and 2021. Econometric methods like the Driscoll-Kraay standard error and other robustness test models are used to look into the links between political risk, green finance, the ecological footprint, and the economic complexity index. According to the research findings, there is a 0.31% and 0.81% decrease in ecological footprint resulting from the implementation of GFI and rises in GDP (gross domestic product). These results suggest that these strategies could play a major role in establishing a sustainable environment. However, in the chosen countries, the ecological footprint increases by 0.81% and 0.80%, respectively, due to the presence of political risk and economic complexity. This study suggests that government involvement is necessary to reduce carbon footprints and protect the ecosystem, based on these empirical findings. Implementing green financing initiatives, fostering technological development, economic diversification, and fostering a stable political environment are all ways to achieve sustainable investments. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Various mechanical and durability tests were conducted on concrete specimens with varying concentrations and types of nanomaterials added. Mechanical properties evaluated included flexural strength, tensile strength, and compressive strength, while the durability properties assessed were resistance to cracking, corrosion, and freeze–thaw cycles. The results indicated that the incorporation of nanomaterials led to significant enhancements in the mechanical and durability properties of the concrete. Addition of nanomaterials and silica fumes increased the compressive strength, tensile strength, and flexural strength by an average of 30%, 20%, and 10%, respectively, and 10%, 20%, and 30%, respectively, for silica fume. Additionally, the concrete specimens with nanomaterials exhibited a significant decrease in cracking and corrosion, as well as improved resistance to freeze–thaw cycles. The implications of this study are significant, as it suggests that nanomaterials can potentially revolutionize the construction industry by enabling the development of stronger, more durable, and more sustainable structures. By reducing the amount of material needed to achieve a certain level of strength and durability, the use of nanomaterials in high-performance concrete can also help to reduce the carbon (C) footprint of the construction industry. However, further research is necessary to fully comprehend the potential of nanomaterials in concrete and to optimize their use in practical applications. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024."

The term 'Red AI' is employed to denote artificial intelligence (AI) models that undergo training using resource-intensive methodologies on very large datasets. This practice can engender substantial energy usage and emissions of carbon, thereby opposing 'Green AI. ' The latter concept alludes to AI models designed for similar efficiency and reduced environmental impact. This objective is realized through the utilization of smaller datasets, less computationally intensive training techniques, or sustainable energy resources. While Red AI prioritizes accuracy and performance, Green AI emphasizes efficiency and sustainability. Given that both paradigms exhibit advantages and limitations, the debates around the topics have burgeoned in the scientific arena, delving into novel algorithms, hardware innovations, and improved data utilization techniques aimed at mitigating the ecological consequences of intricate applications such as GPT and BERT. Nevertheless, due to the relative novelty of this debate, not much effort has been dedicated yet to contextualizing the essence of Red AI and the prospects of Green AI in a coherent framework. Within this context, the present work contributes by meticulously delineating both domains through a multifaceted analysis of their causes and ramifications, described from the points of computer architectures, data structures, and algorithms. Additionally, the study reviews notable instances of study cases based on complex Red AI models. The primary contribution of this article encompasses a comprehensive survey of Red and Green AI, stemming from a selection of the literature performed by the authors, subsequently organized into distinct clusters. These clusters encompass i) articles that qualitatively or quantitatively address the issue of Red AI, identifying Green AI as a plausible remedy, ii) articles offering insights into the environmental impact associated with the deployment of extensive Deep Learning models, and iii) articles introducing the techniques underpinning Green AI, aiming at mitigating the cost of Red AI. The outcome emerging from the analysis performed by this work consists of a compromise between sustainability in contrast to the performance of AI tools. Unless the complex training and inference procedures of software models mitigate their environmental impact, it will be necessary to decrease the level of accuracy of production systems, inevitably conflicting with the objective of the major AI vendors. The outcomes of this work would be beneficial to scholars pursuing intricate Deep Learning architectures in scientific research, as well as AI enterprises struggling with the protracted training demands of commercial products within the realms of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing.  © 2013 IEEE."

In a current endoscopy world, where single use has found its place and techniques are constantly evolving, it will be a challenge to reach these goals. How can we reconcile this evolution to a carbon neutral status by 2050 without compromising patients care, clinical standards and training needs? The European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) together with the European Society of Gastroenterology and Endoscopy Nurses and Associates (ESGENA) recently published a position statement (1) whereas in the UK there is the work from the green endoscopy group (2) in line with the strategy of the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) on sustainability (3). In Flanders, a project called “greendeal in duurzame zorg” had its kick off in March 2023 (4) so it is about time that we in Belgium, as gastroenterologists, start with tangible actions to a more sustainable daily practice. We wrote this position statement in cooperation with the Vlaamse Vereniging voor Gastro-Enterologie (VVGE), the Société royale belge de Gastro-entérologie (SRBGE) and the Belgian Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (BSGIE).

In this paper, we elevate this energy awareness as a key design consideration for maps and introduce a novel conceptual framework for considering the carbon footprint of the content, form, and use of maps. We first systematically investigate how specific map design decisions impact the energy consumption of digital devices. We then discuss the possible ways that digital maps can be greener, outlining a series of ‘big questions’ about the content, form, and use context of maps needing future research to realize greener maps. Finally, we assert that green cartography requires not only novel techniques to design green maps but also greater attention to shaping individual, organizational, and social attitudes towards environmentally-friendly maps. © 2024 The Author(s).

However, creating and tuning such models manually is a tedious and error-prone task. Despite some approaches to automate this process, the state-of-the-art relies on the generation of models, by incorporating the knowledge of experts. Nevertheless, effectively creating and tuning such production simulations is, thus, a key driver for reducing costs, carbon footprint, and tardiness and therefore an essential factor in today´s production. Beneficial would be automated and flexible frameworks, since these are applicable to different use cases requiring less effort. Yet, in the age of Industry 4.0, data is ubiquitous and easily available and can serve as a basis for virtual models representing reality. Increasingly, these virtual models shall be interlinked with the current state of real-world systems to form so-called digital twins. As automated and flexible frameworks are missing, this paper proposes a novel approach where observed real system behavior is used and fed into a large-scale machine learning model trained on a plethora of possible parameter sets. The main target is to train this machine learning model to minimize the reality gap between the behavior of the simulated and real system by selecting corresponding simulation system parameters. By estimating those parameters an enhancement of the simulation will emerge. An interlink to real systems can be derived resulting in a digital shadow which is capable to forecast the future similarly to reality. The approach to overcoming the gap between reality and simulation (real2sim) is validated in simulations. © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V."

However, the production process of cement is extremely consuming enormous natural resources and emitting almost same sum of CO2 into the sky leading to serious damage. Several past research attempts on finding a substitute binder to replace the cement have emerged geopolymer binders as an efficient replacement for cement. Fly ash is one of the main constituents taken into account for making geopolymer binders. However, compared to cement binders, fly ash-based geopolymer binders set very slowly and have mediocre mechanical qualities. To facilitate the faster setting and to boost mechanical properties of fly ash-based geopolymer binders, the current study has replaced fly ash by GGBS up to 50%. Additionally, carbon-based nano-material, i.e., graphene oxide (GO) up to 0.15% is introduced into the mix to boost compressive and flexural strength. According to the results of the experiments, adding more GGBS shortened the setting time and increased compressive strength by 24.16%. Comparing the geopolymer mix with the addition of GO, compressive strength boosted by 41.11% and flexural strength upgraded by 16.18%. Carbon emission analysis was also conducted for GGBS-based geopolymer binders, and findings have shown that geopolymers could drastically reduce the carbon footprint and aid the sustainable construction practices. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

The current study examines how environmental degradation is affected by financial development, LPG use, and economic growth in the BRICS-T countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, and Turkiye) in the period of 1993–2018. For this purpose, four models were tested with Pedroni, Kao, PMG Panel ARDL cointegration and Dumitrescu-Hurlin causality methods. The results show that LPG consumption has a positive effect on the ecological footprint and an adverse influence on the CO2 emission of BRICS - T countries. The financial institutions exhibited to have a positive and significant impact on ecology. Economic growth displayed negative effects on environmental degradation and a positive influence on CO2. Additionally, there is significant evidence for the validity of the EKC hypothesis. Unidirectional causality exists between ecological footprint, LPG, financial market, and economic growth. The financial institution index shows bidirectional causality with the ecological footprint. There is also unidirectional causality between ecological footprint, LPG, financial market, and economic growth. Furthermore, the financial institutions’ index shows a bidirectional causality with the ecological footprint. Also, economic development and financial institution index have a bidirectional relationship with CO2 emissions. On the other hand, the financial market index showed unidirectional causality with CO2 emissions. In short, our study highlights the need for a comprehensive and integrated approach to sustainable development in BRICS - T countries. Policymakers must balance economic growth with environmental protection and consider the potential trade-offs between policy options to promote sustainable and inclusive development. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Ecological footprint methodology is one of the sustainability indicators most used for assessing process environmental impact. This technique quantifies the effect of anthropogenic activities on the environment concerning water, forest products, infrastructure and carbon footprint, providing integral, comparable and reliable results. In this study, the environmental impact generated by taking advantage of red tilapia (Oreochromis Spp.) viscera to produce chemical silage and its implementation in the feeding of laying hens was determined, using the ecological footprint methodology as an indicator of sustainability. The productive system consisted of a red tilapia (Oreochromis ssp.) production farm located in the municipality of San Jerónimo, Antioquia (Colombia). The productive variables of the laying hens, laying percentage, egg weight and feed conversion ratio were evaluated. This chemical silage production process generates a reduction of 1.493 kg of CO2 per month compared to that generated by fresh viscera and are discharged into shallow dumps. Additionally, the main categories that generate the greatest impact on the production system are the use of natural resources and wastewater disposal. On the other hand, the productive variables of laying hens of the Isa Brown breed were not significantly affected by the inclusion of chemical silage at the 95% significance level, maintaining the percentage of laying and improving feed conversion. It was concluded that the use of fish by-products to produce feed for laying hens generates a reduction in the environmental load when compared to conventional waste disposal processes (landfill disposal). Red tilapia (Oreochromis Spp.) viscera chemical silage can be used as an alternative protein substitute in feeding laying hens for improved production performance. © (2024). All Rights Reserved."

The use of recycled materials in concrete has the potential to provide an eco-friendly solution to concrete construction technology and reduce its carbon footprint to some extent. Research has been carried out for decades to make concrete an environmentally friendly material and the inclusion of rubber crumb as a replacement for aggregate is gaining popularity in recent times. This also solves the disposal problem of scrap rubber tires which is a serious concern considering the huge market of rubber tires all over the globe. Contrasting results are observed in previous research on the effect of crumb rubber in concrete. Moreover, a proper guideline is necessary for incorporating rubber crumb in concrete as its properties vary with the origin of the rubber scraps. To determine an optimum replacement level of crumb rubber in concrete, this study investigated the properties of cement concrete made with crumb rubber replacing particles at levels 10, 30, and 50% with fixed water-to-cement ratio of 0.31. Concrete properties that were examined in this comprehensive study include fresh property: slump and mechanical properties: compressive strength and failure pattern. It was observed that up to 10% replacement of sand with crumb rubber in concrete resulted in comparable mechanical properties. © Canadian Society for Civil Engineering 2024."

The article discusses the need to manage and trade carbon assets, develop a comprehensive carbon financing system, and account for and report carbon activities. It proposes constructing a carbon accounting framework that includes all key sources of carbon emissions and carbon sequestration capacity. The article emphasizes the need to integrate carbon accounting into a company's operations and establish a comprehensive carbon finance ecosystem as a critical component of national strategic development. To achieve this, the Chinese government must promote CDM initiatives and relevant policies, enhance support to intermediary institutions, centralize the management of CDM projects, and strengthen carbon financing regulations. The article suggests establishing carbon trading and pricing mechanisms and improving the carbon trading system to create an effective carbon finance regulatory structure. Additionally, a carbon accounting system is required for financial and accounting oversight to support green and low-carbon growth, hence strengthening carbon accounting and reporting regulations of companies. The incorporation of carbon exchange, carbon funds, and carbon sinks banks are also essential in enhancing the financial accounting system. © 2024, Politechnika Lubelska. All rights reserved."

Lifecycle emissions due to farming operations added up to 26.5 MT of carbon dioxide per ha, most of which resulted from chemical fertilizers. Processing latex into ribbed smoked sheet (RSS) rubber and technically specified rubber (TSR) emitted more CO2 due to higher energy requirements for drying compared to making concentrated latex (cenex). Thus, lifecycle emissions were the highest for processing RSS (27.8–41.6 MT CO2) and TSR (13.3–22.9 MT CO2) and the lowest for cenex (2.7–3.9 MT CO2). However, the total amount of CO2 sequestered during the entire lifecycle of the plantation was as high as 500 MT CO2. This resulted in a negative carbon footprint of approximately –15, irrespective of the type of processed NR. This should make NR a much more preferred raw material for the rubber industry than synthetic rubber which has a much higher carbon footprint. Promoting production and consumption of NR will help decarbonize the global rubber industry and benefit millions of small and marginal NR growers around the world. © (2024), (Indian Academy of Sciences).

The results obtained from the research provide a positive premise for the application and implementation of hydrogen co-combustion (or combustion) technology in aircraft turbojet engines, which has not yet found industrial application. Observations and research show that co-combustion of jet fuel with hydrogen helps reduce the carbon footprint of the use of turbojet aircraft engines and also reduces other harmful substances (e.g. carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides or solid particles). During the tests, no deterioration of the engine's operating parameters was observed and the set operating parameters were maintained.

The results revealed that all the crops under monoculture outperformed their intercropping system for seed and stalk/stover yield. Among the different cropping systems, castor + finger millet (2:4) showed highest castor equivalent yield (CEY; 1911 kg ha−1) due to excellent land utilization efficiency (LUE; 106%), land equivalent ratio (LER; 1.13), land equivalent co-efficient (LEC; 0.32) compared to other cropping systems.

Finger millet monoculture showed the highest energy consumption (10,770 MJ ha−1), energy output (96,507 MJ ha−1), and also net energy gain (85,737 MJ ha−1) compared to other cropping systems. However, it was comparable with castor + finger millet (2:4) despite its modest energy consumption (10,530 MJ ha−1). Castor monoculture showed the highest carbon (C) emission (2045 kg CO2-eq. ha−1) and also C output (1760 kg CE ha−1). While, net C gain (1210 kg CE ha−1), C efficiency (3.39 kg kg−1 CE), and C stability index (2.39) were highest in the castor + finger millet intercropping system. Consequently, the adoption of a castor + finger millet (2:4) intercropping system will be a viable alternative for achieving enhanced system productivity, and energy efficiency with lower C-footprints under semi-arid regions. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
652,The impacts of the European chemical industry on the planetary boundaries,Article,Barnosell I.; Pozo C.,Sustainable Production and Consumption,44.0,2024,188,207,10.1016/j.spc.2023.12.006,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85185723075&doi=10.1016%2fj.spc.2023.12.006&partnerID=40&md5=70836588b7d8ddb9334bdad679d808fb,23525509,Scopus,Carbon capture; Chemical industry; Climate change; Life cycle assessment; Planetary boundaries; Sustainability,"The European chemical industry plays a crucial role in the economy, manufacturing thousands of products that find applications across many sectors. On the other hand, the sector is also one of the largest energy consumers, and emits significant amounts of greenhouse gases, together with toxic, bioaccumulative and persistent chemicals. Acknowledging the need for a shift towards a greener industry model, this contribution assesses the absolute sustainability level of the chemical sector by contrasting the impacts it causes with the ecological capacity of the planet, as given by the planetary boundaries framework. Results indicate that impacts incurred by the European chemical industry transgress CO2-based thresholds significantly, with burdens on atmospheric CO2 concentration, energy imbalance, and ocean acidification being 15, 16 and 6 times larger than planetary limits. The biosphere integrity boundary, assessed here based on functional diversity, is also transgressed by 3 %. The five chemicals with the highest production volume, namely ammonia, polypropylene, high-density polyethylene, styrene, and benzene, are responsible for around 50 % of impacts in all the planetary boundaries. This suggests that they should be the target of dedicated research and policies. Finally, the study assesses a set of improvement pathways for the European chemical industry to become sustainable. It is found that the deployment of carbon capture and storage technologies to compensate for the greenhouse gases emitted by the sector would allow the chemical industry to meet all the planetary boundaries concurrently, yet burden-shifting would still cause other planetary boundaries to be deteriorated. This evidences the need to employ holistic approaches to assess the wide implications of any solution adopted within or outside the chemical industry. © 2023 The Authors"

The need to use sustainable buildings to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions has been underscored by several sustainability standards, such as LEED and BREAM, in order to promote environmental protection. The WELL standard is a notable standard that places emphasis on the attainment of human health and well-being through the design and construction of the built environment. This followed the emergence of sustainability principles that sought to include social and human considerations in the building's efficiency. The research dilemma emerged due to a limited comprehension of the correlation between WELL standards and their efficacy in mitigating the carbon footprint of both buildings and people. The present study posits that the use of WELL indicators has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions inside the workplace. The study employed a descriptive analytical methodology to ascertain the findings and deductions that certain attributes within the WELL v2 standard have the potential to mitigate carbon emissions. Notably, the Well innovation feature emerged as a significant contributor, as it promotes the inclusion of greenhouse gas management within a comprehensive framework centered on health and well-being. © 2024, University of Kufa.

However, few upscaling approaches take a consistent approach to upscaling both carbon and energy fluxes. A lack of uniformity in the upscaling approach could lead to inconsistencies in global interannual variability of fluxes and between types of carbon and energy fluxes. Hence, this study aims to identify obstacles in flux upscaling and propose a uniform upscaling framework UFLUX for gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (Reco), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), sensible heat (H), and latent energy (LE). The key findings are as follows: 1) The upscaling performance exhibits a limited improvement from the use of more advanced machine learning approaches (e.g. <0.3 in R2 improvements while using deep neural networks). 2) The spatial density of EC towers is the primary factor determining the effectiveness of upscaling, explaining >50% of the upscaling uncertainty. 3) The UFLUX framework considered the interconnection between fluxes and achieved a competitive validation precision (daily R2 = 0.7 on average of five flux types) when compared with products that upscaled a subset of the fluxes. UFLUX effectively preserved the ecosystem light-use efficiency (0.83 of linear regression slope and the same after), Bowen ratio (0.8), and particularly, the water-use efficiency (0.81), when compared to the only other product (i.e. FLUXCOM) to upscale both carbon and water. © 2024 The Author(s).

The world’s population will continue to grow at a rapid pace in the future. As a result, our future generations may find it difficult to live on this planet in a healthy manner. The world’s developed and developing countries began to investigate various methods for reducing their carbon footprint. However, it will not be sustainable if it is also not economically viable. In this scenario, maintaining a good profit for businesses while reducing their carbon footprint necessitates a pragmatic strategy. In this article, we will try to find a way out that will provide us with a practical solution. We will simulate the profitability of an upstream oil manufacturer that has invested heavily in green technologies. Under a carbon tax system, we will use the production-inventory model. This system assumes that capital investment in green technology can reduce emissions, and increase profits. We used data from the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation of India, available in its annual reports. As a matter of fact, the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation of India accounts for 70% of crude oil production in India and is a major player in India’s upstream oil companies. The results were quite encouraging, with deviations between expected and actual values being less than 10%. The findings also led us to believe that the excise duty and the pollution control tax levied in India can be regarded as a Green Tax or Carbon Tax. We used a published research model to find the optimal solution. © 2024 Faculty of Organizational Sciences, Belgrade. All rights reserved."

This research aimed to assess the performance of two types of RWH systems (gravity and pump-driven) at a local public school in replacing non-potable water for toilet flushing. The volume of harvested water, efficiency to meet demand, expenses involved and associated environmental burdens were key criteria of performance. Economic considerations included capital costs and return periods, while the environmental aspects encompassed simplified life cycle assessments (LCAs) as well as specific carbon footprints. The gravity-fed system supplied 452.5 kL/annum and covered 31.8% of the demand for flushing water for toilets for the school investigated. The pumped system provided 476.8 kL/annum representing 33.5% of the demand. Together they would be able to supply 65.3% of the demand. The catchment area of these two systems differed and there was no overlap. As expected, the gravity-fed system outperformed the pumped system, both economically and environmentally, because no energy for pumping was needed. In terms of costs, the difference was small, and the payback periods of both systems were similar. However, environmentally, the LCA scores for the pumped system were an order of magnitude higher for all 18 impact categories considered. Carbon footprints showed that in the construction stage both systems have similar footprints. For the operation stage, the comparison was extended, as there were higher energy requirements for the pumped system (about 4 times higher than those from the provision of municipal potable water), but in the same range or lower when compared with other alternative sources of water like groundwater abstraction, recycling of municipal water and desalination. The gravity-fed system required no energy for pumping. This study shows how trade-offs in assessing the overall performance of RWH systems can be considered, leading to better decision making. © The Author(s)."

The implementation by farmers of innovative solutions for improving farm efficiency and sustainability has been addressed in many ways. One of these solutions deals with the implementation of autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) to carry out agricultural tasks, where the impacts associated with agricultural AGVs are still limited. Thus, this study aims to analyze the energy and environmental burdens of an AGV coupled with a mower. The life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology was adopted to analyze energy requirements and the associated environmental emissions. The fully electric AGV is equipped with two rubber tracks powered by 2000 W motors. The self-propelled rotary mower is powered by a 9 kW engine, weighs 230 kg, and has a working width of 120 cm. The results of the analysis showed that the embodied primary energy of both AGV plus Implement (AGV+I) accounted for 104 MJ kg−1, while related emissions were found to be 6.86 kg CO2e kg−1. Moreover, analyzing the inputs of the AGV+I system, the battery pack and the iron materials accounted for the main portion of the total impacts. In conclusion, the outcomes of this study will strongly help to pursue the objectives and targets foreseen by the main strategic plans related to the reduction of environmental impacts, improvement of agricultural production efficiency, and increasing the digitization and innovation of the agricultural sector. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Based on field experiments and the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, a comprehensive carbon footprint assessment of rice monoculture, rice-shrimp co-cropping, and rice-crab co-cropping models was conducted in this study, and the NEEB of different rice farming models was calculated based on the economic benefits. The carbon footprints per unit area of rice monoculture, rice-shrimp co-cropping, and rice-crab co-cropping models were 14122.65 kg (CO2-eq)·hm-2, 13791.78 kg (CO2-eq)·hm-2, and 15617.13 kg (CO2-eq)·hm-2, respectively, according to the data. Hotspot analysis revealed that the carbon footprint composition of the rice-shrimp and rice-crab co-cropping models was influenced more by CH4 emissions, energy use, and feed inputs. Due to the greater economic production values of rice-shrimp and rice-crab co-cropping modes, the NEEB of these two modes increased by 81.45% and 69.52%, respectively, as compared to rice monoculture. Overall, rice-shrimp and rice-crab co-cropping models can reduce emissions and improve paddy field efficiency to some extent when compared to rice monoculture and rice-crab co-cropping models, but attention should be paid to the point of trade-off between carbon footprints and economic benefits in order to promote the green and efficient development of the rice-fishery co-cropping model. The technique utilized in this work can give technical assistance for a more thorough carbon footprint assessment of multifunctional agricultural production systems. © 2024, HARD Publishing Company.

However, these traditional environmental degradation indicators do not consider the supply side of environmental problems. Therefore, this study focuses on the dynamic influence of financial development, energy efficiency, economic growth, and technological innovation on environmental degradation in India through the load capacity factor, including both the supply and demand sides of environmental problems. For that purpose, the recently developed dynamically simulated autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) method is employed using the annual time-series data extending from 1980-2020. The dynamically simulated ARDL results demonstrate that financial development, economic growth, and technological innovation have a dynamic adverse impact on the load capacity factor, whereas energy efficiency has a positive dynamic influence on environmental quality. In addition, the results support the validity of the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis as the negative effect of economic growth on environmental quality decreases over time. Based on the study findings, policy recommendations are provided for India. Finally, this study utilizing load capacity factor as an indicator for environmental quality will provide new topics in exploring the determinants of environmental degradation. © 2023.

A broad socio-political consensus on the need for climate change mitigation enabled the BoE and ECB to begin integrating CRFRs into their supervisory frameworks without affecting their socio-political reputation while the carbon bias in their own asset purchase programs compelled both central banks to also start greening their monetary policy to preserve their performative reputation.

The main characteristic of this type of material is the shape memory effect, which is the capacity to return to an initial shape after heating (activation process). This property allows using this alloy as a prestraining material (Shahverdi et al. in Eng Struct 117:263–273, 2016), ensuring the anchoring and heating to start the martensitic transformation. This research uses a Φ11 mm rebar Fe-SMA as a continuity prestress reinforcement in the hogging bending moment region in Hollow-Core Slab (HCS) structural floors. This paper highlights the preliminary results of the testing of four real-scale specimens. The results are part of an extensive experimental campaign where it is compared two parameters: having or not concrete topping, and prestressing (through activation), or not, of the Fe-SMA re-bars. Despite that the prestressing effect has worked correctly in both cases, with and without concrete topping, the constructive process is more straightforward using concrete topping. Moreover, it has been proved that using this technology as prestressed reinforcement improves the Service Limit State (SLS) behaviour avoiding premature cracks and improving the element stiffness. Consequently, whereas Fe-SMA has been used since now mainly in rehabilitation, considering this solution in structural designs would allow constructing slenderer structural floors, reducing the amount of concrete and the carbon footprint that this material produces. Furthermore, if an existing building needs to increase the structural stiffness, or its rehabilitation supposes an increment of loads, introducing this technology could be a satisfactory solution to consider. © Tongji University Press 2024."

Both sectors have a substantial carbon footprint, a significant concern for global warming. Clay brick production requires kiln burning, which causes air pollution. Moreover, traditional brick industries consume a considerable amount of topsoil layer from agricultural land. On the other hand, due to rapid urbanization and the growing housing needs, construction and demolition wastes are increasing each day. This study, therefore, aims to find an alternative solution by producing non-fired geopolymer building blocks using construction and demolition wastes. Fly ash and Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS) based geopolymer binder and construction, and demolition waste filler are used to produce non-fired building blocks. The physical and mechanical characteristics of geopolymer building blocks are evaluated using various mix proportions. The activator molarity was varied to find out the optimum for geopolymer concrete. The investigated result reveals that all the prepared geopolymer building blocks achieved at least 17.2 MPa compressive strength as per ASTM C62. The produced specimens also satisfied BDS 208: 2009 standard for bricks. The highest compressive strength (36.5 MPa) was achieved with 60% GGBS and a 12 M NaOH activator. In general, the compressive strength of bricks tends to increase as GGBS amount and NaOH activator concentrations increase. These blocks have shown excellent results regarding water absorption capacity and efflorescence. The promising results create a more significant opportunity to establish an industry based on a non-fired, eco-friendly geopolymer building block which will reduce the carbon footprint and the pressure on the fertile topsoil layer of agricultural lands. This study will give a viable indication of the construction and demolition waste disposal issues. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

Yet, its interpretation varies among researchers who may lack familiarity with their specific field’s diverse criteria or possibilities. In the Mexican context, there is a dedicated effort to advance the development of new materials and sustainable processes for construction. Despite commendable initiatives, a significant issue arises from the insufficient determination of the environmental impact of these innovative materials. This gap is particularly pronounced in the swiftly evolving construction sector, where vernacular practices may align with sustainability criteria, but their environmental implications remain uncertain. To address this discrepancy, we propose a protocol brief review approach, providing a systematic method for evaluating the sustainability of materials or processes applied in construction. This approach underscores the importance of contextualizing sustainability criteria, recognizing that what may be considered sustainable in one environmental context may not hold the same designation in another. From a quantitative perspective, the proposal introduces a structured justification framework. This framework aims to guide researchers in articulating and substantiating claims regarding the sustainability of a given element, whether affirming or denying its status as sustainable. By integrating these considerations, this paper aims to enhance the precision and comprehensiveness of sustainability assessments within the construction realm. This contribution seeks to foster a more informed and nuanced understanding of the environmental impact of materials and processes in this dynamic field. © 2024 Seventh Sense Research Group®."

By employing the panel cross-sectionally augmented autoregressive distributed lags method (Chudik and Pesaran 2015), we explored the effect of the carbon footprint of top-income classes on economic performance in both the short and long term. The empirical results assume that carbon inequality indicators boost economic growth in the short and long run. In other words, economic growth may be slowed when carbon inequality is reduced. Our study has important implications for climate policy in the MENA region. In this context, relying on a carbon tax can increase business costs and reduce investment incentives leading to a decline in growth. Governments should adopt a more comprehensive approach incorporating other policy instruments such as nudging techniques, financial incentives, and public awareness campaigns.

666,Evaluating the symmetric and asymmetric effectiveness of low carbon energy consumption for ecological footprint in China: the role of environment-related technological innovation,Article,Jin X.; Guo C.; Ahmad W.; Ameen M.S.; Abbas S.,Environmental science and pollution research international,31.0,2024,1926,1940,10.1007/s11356-023-31054-x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85182744257&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-023-31054-x&partnerID=40&md5=ea69a5e23cfa9a5d697e5a60914de0d8,16147499,Scopus,China; Eco-innovation; Ecological footprint; Low carbon energy; NARDL,"The objective of this study is to scrutinize the impact of low carbon energy consumption, environmental-related technological innovation, urbanization, economic growth, and trade on China's ecological footprint from 1980 to 2021. To investigate the nature of the long-term connections between the variables, we employ the symmetric and asymmetric autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) technique to explore the long- and short-run elasticities of coefficients. The results of ARDL and NARDL verified the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis in the long run in the presence of low carbon energy consumption. Moreover, the findings show that the positive part of low carbon energy consumption is negatively connected with the ecological footprint. Alternatively, the positive part of low carbon energy consumption is positively linked with the ecological footprint. The outcome highlights that environment-related technological innovation reduces the level of ecological footprint. Similarly, urbanization has a detrimental effect on the ecological footprint. Based on the estimated findings, it is suggested that China's economy should place a greater emphasis on increasing its level of investment in the low carbon energy sector and adopting severe environmental legislation to protect the economy from environmental burden. © 2023.

Determining the carbon footprint of medical procedures may aid in selecting a less impactful technique moving forward. The purpose of this study was to understand the environmental impact of different anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction techniques, for which there is no consensus in terms of optimal graft. Methods: A life cycle analysis of different anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction techniques was performed. These included quadrupled semitendinosus graft, bone-patellar tendon-bone graft, iliotibial band augmented with gracilis graft, doubled semitendinosus and doubled gracilis graft, and quadriceps tendon graft. All procedures were systematically paired with a lateral extra-articular procedure. The study was conducted in a specialised centre using surgeon preference cards, with the help of a dedicated organisation for calculation according to the ISO 14044 standard. The primary outcome measure was the carbon footprint of each of the five techniques. Secondary outcomes included other environmental impact indicators, including human carcinogenic toxicity and mineral resource scarcity, among others, based on the ReCiPe 2016 midpoint guideline. The analysis had three scopes, each encompassing varying numbers of processes: graft implantation, full procedure, and entire environmental impact, from medical prescription to patient discharge. Results were reported as percentage increases compared to the graft technique with the lowest environmental impact. Results: It was demonstrated that the surgical procedure itself accounted for <40% of the life cycle, with arthroscopy being 88% of surgery's GHG emissions, and scrubbing and draping contributing 39% to the carbon footprint. The iliotibial band augmented with gracilis tendon technique had the lowest carbon footprint (0.199 Kg Co2 eq), and the least impact in most categories at all scopes of the life cycle analysis. Using this technique as a reference, in terms of graft implantation, it was determined that extensor mechanism grafts had the highest carbon footprint (300% higher than the reference). Greater scopes showed a similar trend, with percentage differences decreasing significantly, reaching 1–3% when considering the entire environmental impact for most categories. Nevertheless, among the aforementioned factors of the ReCiPe 2016 guidelines, the semitendinosus graft paried with a lateral extra-articular procedure displayed greater difference in human carcinogenic toxicity and mineral resource scarcity (6% and 10% respectively) compared to the reference. The individual processes with the highest impact were also highlighted. Conclusions: In the institution where the study was conducted, the studied iliotibial band graft option was found to have the lowest environmental impact. Such analyses of standardised procedures can be replicated in individual institutions in order to determine their environmental impact. Identification of procedures with comparable results and differing environmental consequences may influence the future decision-making process.

As the world increasingly prioritizes a greener and cleaner future, the transition from ICEs to EVS offers significant benefits as EVs are zero-emission vehicles. However, considering the production and disposal stages of EVs, they cannot be considered entirely emission-free. But in comparison to ICEs, they still have a much smaller carbon footprint. Moreover, studying EV technology is essential to bringing this to the lowest possible extent. However, these advancements come with challenges. In this review article, we have taken an in-depth look into the various challenges, namely the economic challenges, technological challenges, and environmental challenges, faced by EV technology today and the various solutions proposed by researchers, their limitations, and future potential in EV technology advancement. Within this context, we discuss the influence of governmental policies, accessibility and affordability of EVs to the masses, natural and man-made disasters, economic instability, technological limitations posed by the vehicle technology, and limitations posed by battery technology with batteries being the central element for EVs, limitations associated with the existing infrastructure and its ability to support widescale use of EVs, and environmental factors like carbon footprint, among other factors, on EVs technology and the opportunities this technology can make use of in the future.

An emerging initiative that combines elements of the traditional in-person conference and a virtual conference is a multi-hub approach. Here we report on a real-world trial of a multi-hub approach, the World Climate Research Programme/Stratosphere-Troposphere Processes and their Role in Climate (WCRP/SPARC) General Assembly held in Qingdao–Reading–Boulder during the last week of October 2022 with more than 400 participants. While there are other examples of conferences run in dual-hub or hybrid online and in-person formats, we are not aware of other large atmospheric science conferences held in this format. Based on travel surveys of participants, we estimate that the multi-hub approach reduced the carbon footprint from travel by between a factor of 2.3 and 4.1 times the footprint when hosting the conference in a single location. This resulted in a saving of at least 288 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2eq) and perhaps as much as 683 tCO2eq, compared to having the conference in one location only. Feedback from participants, collected immediately after the conference, showed that the majority would again attend another conference in a similar format. There are many ways that the format of the SPARC General Assembly could have been improved, but this proof of concept provides an inspiration to other groups to give the multi-hub format a try. © 2024 American Meteorological Society.

In this paper, we integrated two nighttime light (NTL) data: the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational Linescan System (OLS) and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) composite data to estimate the energy carbon emissions from 2000 to 2019. Then the spatiotemporal dynamics of carbon footprint and deficit in the Yellow River Basin were analyzed at the provincial, municipal, and county scales combined with NPP data. The study shows that (1) the total amount of energy consumption CO2 emissions in the Yellow River Basin had increased from 1332 Mt in 2000 to 6469 Mt in 2019, but the average annual growth rate slowed down after 2010 from 11.5 to 5.61%. (2) From 2000 to 2018, the provinces with the highest carbon footprint and carbon deficit were concentrated in Inner Mongolia and Shanxi. In 2018, Inner Mongolia's carbon footprint was 1366.91 × 104 km2, accounting for 22.8% of the total. Cities with high carbon footprint were mainly economic centers and energy-intensive areas of various provinces. High-carbon deficit counties were mainly distributed in the western region. In 2018, 954 counties exhibited carbon deficits. (3) The carbon footprint in the Yellow River Basin at the municipal and county scales have a significant spatial correlation. The H-H clusters of the carbon footprint on the municipal scale were distributed in the middle reaches of the Yellow River Basin. At the county scale, the L-L clusters were mainly in Sichuan and eastern Henan regions. Through the analysis of the spatial and temporal evolution of carbon footprint and carbon deficit in the Yellow River Basin, it is significant to measure the degree of comprehensive coordination of carbon sources and sinks in the basin, to grasp the differences in the level of regional carbon emissions, and to promote synergistic regional governance, assist in the formulation of more precise carbon emission reduction policies, and to promote green and high-quality development. © 2023.

However, emission from brick industries is a significant concern, particularly in a developing country like Bangladesh. Carbon Footprint (CF) is an important and widely used environmental indicator defined as the equivalent carbon dioxide emitted into the environment from the direct or indirect activities linked with the manufacturing process of a product. This study reports a detailed evaluation of CF of brick technologies and compares comprehensive carbon efficiency of different types of kilns currently operating in Bangladesh from the perspective of Carbon Footprint analysis. A field survey of six different types of brick kilns was conducted to collect information regarding fuel, electricity, soil, and water used in various operations of the brick manufacturing process. The assessment was carried out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines. Among the four different technologies, two Zigzag kilns showed the lowest CF values, 217.561 gm CO2-eq/kg fired brick and 218.798 gm CO2-eq/kg fired brick, accordingly, for the production of 100,000 bricks. In comparison, the two Fixed-Chimney Kilns (FCK) obtained a higher value of 291.096 gm CO2-eq/kg and 265.547 gm CO2-eq/kg. Despite being the most efficient technology, Tunnel Kiln showed a higher CF value than Hybrid Hoffman Kiln (HHK). Their CF values are 284.170 gm CO2-eq/kg fired brick and 266.795 gm CO2-eq/kg fired brick, respectively. This study also identified HHK with the lowest CF value of 203.768 gm CO2-eq/kg if fired with natural gas. Being the first carbon footprint study of the brick industry of Bangladesh as per the authors’ knowledge, this paper aims to help policymakers taking appropriate policy interventions to progress specifically in the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goal 10, i.e., take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

GHGs due to nitrogen (N) fertilizer use can be reduced to a certain extent with legume agriculture. This study was conducted to estimate the amount of N produced by biological N fixation (BNF) in legumes grown in Türkiye, the amount of synthetic N fertilizer corresponding to this amount of N, and the global GHG emission equivalent of the production, transport, and use of this fertilizer in the field. Firstly, the amount of N fixed by BNF in a year in legume cultivation areas in Türkiye was calculated. Then, the GHG equivalents emitted during the production, transport, and application in the field of synthetic N fertilizers, which is the equivalent of N fixed by BNF, were calculated. The total amount of N fixed with BNF in 2022 in Türkiye is 363,354 tons. The total GHGs emissions during the production, transport, and use of N fertilizer equivalent to 363354 t of N fixed by BNF is 2,631,043 tons CO2-eq. In other words, in one year in Türkiye, 2,631,043 tons of CO2-eq GHGs will be reduced thanks to legume agriculture. GHG emissions of the Turkish agricultural sector (total 72.1 Mt CO2-eq) have been reduced by about 3.65% (2.63 Mt CO2-eq). For an economically and environmentally sustainable agriculture, we need to give more importance to the cultivation of pulses. © 2024, HARD Publishing Company. All rights reserved."

However, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the potential for reducing these emissions through the production of various types of animal feed remain ambiguous. Thus, this study is aimed at estimating GHG emissions from broiler, layer, and swine feed production in Thailand and identifying economic advantages of alternative methods to mitigate those emissions. Field surveys were carried out to quantify the input and output of energy and materials in 10 commercial feed mills so as to determine greenhouse gas emissions using proper emission factors. The scope of this study is based on the cradle-to-gate approach. The functional unit used for greenhouse gas evaluation was kg CO2-eq/t of feed. Total greenhouse gas emissions from broiler, layer, and swine feed production were found to be 650 ± 20, 706 ± 20, and 466 ± 20 kg CO2-eq/t of feed, respectively. Layer feed production created the highest greenhouse gas emissions, 1.09 and 1.52 times that of broiler and swine feed production, respectively. This is because layer feed required intensive fish meal (FM) as protein sources for improving egg quality. In broiler and swine feed production, the most significant emissions are attributed to the use of maize grain (MG) and soybean meal (SBM) as sources of carbohydrate and protein in those feeds. However, animal feed production operation at the existing condition still emits CO2 to the atmosphere as CO2 fixation efficiencies of 69.3, 67.5, and 75.9% for broiler, layer, and swine feed, respectively. From the sustainable resource consumption scenarios in broiler, layer, and swine feed production, approximately 39.6, 49.6, and 43.3% reduced carbon emissions could be achieved by using MG rotated with SB in the maize plantation phase and substituting FM, wheat grain and fossil fuel needed in the manufacturing process with SBM, locally-produced tapioca chips and biomass energy. Consequently, the potential cost savings of such replacements were determined to be 54.0, 62.5, and 29.7 USD/t of feed, respectively. © 2023.

This study explores the effectiveness of the HSSD as an indirect solar drying technique in drying lemongrass, thyme, marjoram, and lavender at different temperatures (30, 40, and 50 ± 2 °C), focusing on its ability to retain quality features. The total energy consumption was estimated by values of 27.72 kWh for lemongrass and 43.02 kWh for lavender using HSSD at 50 ± 2 °C. Generally, HSSD showed an improvement in the studied physicochemical quality parameters. The green color retention was with the parameters of 15.60 ± 0.89, −5.28 ± 1.92, −3.89 ± 1.86, and −5.89 ± 2.40 for lemongrass, thyme, marjoram, and lavender samples, respectively. The highest values of the lemon grass, thyme, marjoram, and lavender oil content (1.96, 1.73, 3.40, and 2.76%, respectively) were obtained when the aromatic herbs were dried using the HSSD at 40 °C.

The carbon and energy footprints (CF and EF) of 10 conventionally cooked traditional recipes representative of the Mediterranean diet (S0 = food from industrial and globalized agriculture, non-seasonally consumed) were estimated. The CF of the recipes was estimated to be between 0.56 and 13.4 kg CO2 eq/kg. Our results show that, depending on the drivers or scenarios (S1, S2, S3, S4) and the recipes, significant reductions in CF and EF are indeed achieved, which can be of up to 57% in CF when considering the reduction potential of these four drivers in an agroecological transition process (S5). © 2024 Taylor & Francis."

It is considered a sustainable material due to its low carbon footprint and environmental friendly characteristics. This study examines the key influencing factors that affect the behavior of this material, such as the steel fiber volume ratio, recycled aggregate replacement rate, concrete strength grade, anchorage length, and stirrup constraint. The study investigates the bond failure morphology, bond-slip, and bond strength constitutive relationship of steel fiber recycled concrete. The results show that the addition of steel fibers at 0.5%, 1.0%, and 1.5% volume ratios can improve the ultimate bond strength of pull-out specimens by 9.05%, 6.94%, and 5.52%, respectively. The replacement rate of recycled aggregate has minimal effect on the typical bond strength of pull-out specimens. However, the ultimate bond strengths of pull-out specimens with concrete strength grades C45 and C60 have improved compared to those with C30 grade. The specimens with longer anchorage lengths exhibit lower ultimate bond strength, with a reduction of 33.19% and 46.37% for anchorage lengths of 5D and 7D, respectively, compared to those without stirrups. Stirrup restraint of 1 φ 8 and 2 φ 8 improves the ultimate bond strength by 5.29% and 6.90%, respectively. Steel fibers have a significant effect on the behavior of concrete after it cracks, especially during the stable expansion stage, crack instability expansion stage, and failure stage. © 2024, Tech Science Press.

Under normal circumstances, it performs satisfactorily but deteriorates under extreme situations. To attain the desired characteristics during construction, admixtures are used in cementitious materials. Accelerating admixtures fasten the setting and development of early age strength of the cement composites. Stone, on the other hand, is another significant building material used in the construction industry. The stone industry is also expanding with the construction industry’s rise, generating tonnes of debris every year. Stone wastes in various forms, such as slurry, dust/powder, broken slabs, and aggregates, have been dumped on valuable land and watersheds. It creates a nuisance to the ecosystem, thereby becoming a potential environmental threat. In the present study, stone powder, along with accelerating admixtures has been utilized in concrete mixtures to examine its feasibility in terms of ecological and economic aspects. The study aimed to investigate the environmental impact of different additives i.e., stone powder, calcium nitrate, and triethanolamine individually and in combination for various cement concrete mixes. The environmental impact of concrete mixtures was evaluated in terms of embodied energy, carbon footprint, and cost analysis of different concrete mixes and compared with the plain mix. The performance index of different mixtures of concrete was also assessed. Results showed that stone powder was found to be very efficient in lowering the cost, energy use, and CO2 emission among all additives. Compared to other additives, using stone powder in concrete enhanced the performance effectively. © 2023, Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH. All rights reserved."

However, given its natural origin, raw material is usually preferred over synthetic reinforcements. The present work investigates the effect of the acquisition in the raw material of a woven biocomposite material, particularly reinforcement of fique (Furcraea Andina), a plant of South American origin. Initially, a geometric characterization of the tissue layer using micrographs is presented. Next, a numerical campaign is carried out to determine the effects of the distribution of the variables on the mechanical behavior of the biocomposite, and this process is carried out using the homogenization of composite materials with the Texgen software as a tissue modeler. The results are the engineering constants and the elasticity and stiffness matrices. The results show a considerable scatter of mechanical properties given the textile's geometrical imperfections, which implies a non-even distribution of stiffness across the laminated part. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to the Korean Fiber Society."

Construction and its allied activities accounting for more than 38% of global carbon emission need to take part in mitigating as such. Many such metropolitan cities saw improper design and town planning resulting to water logging and drainage issues, which are a main concern. One such mitigation strategy is to implement the use of Porous Concrete on light traffic pathways. Porous concrete are construction materials that allows for seepage of water through the appropriate voids in its form without compromising its strength. Porous concrete as pavement materials will also address the drainage issues that the main Indian cities like Delhi and Mumbai are facing. It is so designed to recharge ground water as well by its seepage action. This study focused on the optimum design for strength parameters of Porous Concrete partially replaced with glass powder in 0%, 10%, 15% and 20%.

A case study in Tamil Nadu, India shows that sustainable net zero water withdrawal photovoltaics (PV) manufacturing can be achieved by a) utilizing on-site wastewater treatment and zero liquid discharge units to maximize the usage of onsite reclaimed water, b) using offsite reclaimed water to meet the remaining water demand, and c) implementing continuous improvement in water conservation. Net zero water can be combined with net zero electricity to reduce the life cycle water footprint of PV modules by ∼60% while also reducing the life cycle carbon footprint by ∼40%. While crucial for managing local water and energy resources, net zero strategies have a relatively small (∼20%) impact on reducing the total multicriteria product footprint.

In this research, verification was done on the capability of increasing superheat to improve the performance of the air-cooled split unit and the effect of power consumed by the air conditioning system. The superheat was increased by the heat harvested from the condensing unit of the air-cooled split unit by using a heat pipe. The heat pipe was charged with water, R134a, and R600a with a 100% filling ratio and 90° and 70° inclination angles. K-Type thermocouples, pressure gauges, and power meter were used in data collection. According to data analysis, water with a 90° inclination angle of heat pipe showed the best performance compared to other fluids because of its ability to increase superheat by approximately 32% compared to R600a which increased only approximately 6.5% compared to normal conventional air conditioning. However, it demonstrated that a rise in the superheat at the suction line and a rise in the Coefficient of Performance cannot guarantee a fall in energy usage. This was due to an increase of superheat by the water heat pipe at 90° angle inclination indicating approximately a 28.8% increase in power consumption. © 2024, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

To date, the research literature on wool carbon footprint is limited, and there is a lack of research on Victoria. These studies did not consider the influence of changes in weight and productive lifespan. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by calculating the wool carbon footprint in Victoria and improving the calculation method. In this article, 20,000 sheep in Victoria were investigated. The average weights of the sheep were obtained by curve fitting and calculating. Two scenarios with 5-year and 6-year productive lifespans were used to calculate the carbon footprint of merino wool by the mass allocation method, economic allocation method, and protein mass allocation method. Results revealed that the carbon footprint of wool for the 5-year and 6-year productive lifespans were 14.158–49.040 kg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-e)/kg wool and 16.743–52.882 kg CO2-e/kg wool. Rumination and excretion accounted for the largest proportion, followed by phosphate fertilizer, electricity, and potash fertilizer. The longer the productive lifespan and the heavier the sheep, the greater the greenhouse gas emissions from rumination and excretion, leading to a larger carbon footprint for wool. For the same productive lifespan, the economic allocation method produced the highest carbon footprint for wool compared to the mass allocation method, which produced the lowest carbon footprint. This study provides a reference for the subsequent carbon footprint accounting of wool from cradle to farm-gate and helps the wool industry save energy and reduce emissions. © The Author(s) 2023."

This research area has gained considerable attention and significance for promoting high-quality coal mining, low environmental impact, and sustainable development. In this study, a response surface experiment was designed with desulfurization gypsum (DG), gasification slag (GS), and furnace bottom slag (FBS) as factors to analyze the performance of backfill materials with varying compositions. Parameters such as bleeding rate, compactness, viscosity, setting time, and age strength were tested. An optimal composition of backfill materials was obtained, with a MCSW content exceeding 90 %, 28-day strength exceeding 2 MPa, initial setting time between 240 and 480 min, and final setting time ranging from 300 to 600 min. The investigation of the optimal materials involved characterizing the pore structure, microstructure, composition, and silica gel structure through techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). Additionally, the study explored micro-interface structures and enhancement mechanisms. After 28 days of curing, the backfill with a composition of DG 0.3, FBS 0.2, GS 0.1 exhibited a compressive strength of 5.18 MPa, with an initial setting time as short as 140 min. This can be attributed to the precipitation of silica gel on the grain surface, which mitigated the segregation effect. The silica gel promoted inter-particle bonding and rapid viscosity, preventing particle settling. This method not only ensures the safe disposal of coal-based solid waste but also contributes to the coordinated development of coal resource exploitation, environmental protection, and reduced carbon footprint. © 2023 The Authors"

Furthermore, creating long-term sustainable social, economic and environmental processes by eliminating current systemic failures can also be a significant challenge for individual nations. One thing is sure: the status quo is not sustainable. Taking all these aspects into account, this paper seeks to answer the question of the extent to which the performance of freight transport in each EU Member State contributes to the change in the ecological footprint and how national characteristics influence this. The research introduces a newly established indicator, the freight transport footprint, which is based on a family of footprint formulas and specifically seeks to answer the extent to which freight transport burdens our environment. © 2024 Budapest University of Technology and Economics.

Anaerobic digestion (AD) has the potential to produce biogas from such wastes and reduce carbon footprint. The present study was aimed at developing an indigenous, user-friendly, compact digester to produce biogas from household kitchen waste (KW) in decentralized manner. A survey (1041 households) showed 0.5 kg/d KW generation per family. The mixed KW has average 0.08 g total solids (TS) and 0.048 g total volatile solids (VS). The study involved for the first time, a comparison of the efficacy of cow dung inoculum from rural/urban areas with different feeding bases. Ten each (30 L) rural (RCD)/urban (UCD) digesters (average 24kgVS/m3 feedstock concentration, FC; 0.8 kgVS/m3 organic loading rate, OLR) were run in AD cycle for 90d. RCD digesters produced 173–462 mL/gVS, while only four UCD digesters produced biogas (115–273 mL/gVS). Amongst various substrate-to-water ratios, 1:3 ratio gave the best biogas yield (352–384 mL/gVS). Scale-up parameters were calculated for designing 0.5/0.25 kg/d KW fed digester. The study is novel in reporting for the first time significant effect of inoculum source and developing compact indigenous biogas reactor for in situ management/utilization of KW to produce clean cooking fuel with scope for add-on controls. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Transporting subgrade soil having good engineering properties with more lead distances is not a sustainable option. The main aim of the research paper is to study the effect of stabilized subgrade soil in the Mechanistic-Empirical design with two cross sections of traditional aggregate bases subbase (Type-I) and cement-treated subbase layers (Type-II). The life cycle cost analysis and life cycle analysis of the bituminous concrete pavement were carried out to assess the economic viability and carbon footprint estimation using the Net Present Value method and Cradle to Grave approach respectively. From the recent literature, two stabilized subgrade soils (a) CL soil stabilized with 7.5% Flyash and Eko soil enzyme (Case-I) and (b) CL with 5% Lime stabilized (Case-II) were considered for pavement design. All other required data for pavement design and the density of materials used for construction were assumed. From the results, it is observed that the life cycle cost of Type II bituminous concrete pavement with Case-II subgrade soil is 37% less compared with Type-I pavement with Case-I subgrade soil. In the case of Type-II pavement with Case-II, subgrade soil the carbon footprint reduces up to 53% compared with Type-I pavement with Case-I subgrade soil. From this, it can be concluded the Type-II bituminous concrete pavement designed with Case-II subgrade soil is more sustainable improving the long-term life of the pavement without critical failures like fatigue cracking and wheel path rutting. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

Consumers can drive system change and help mitigate the climate crisis through demand behaviour, with youth uniquely positioned as key actors. Carbon labelling offers a tool for informing consumers about the carbon footprint of food, and thereby promoting purchase of lower-carbon products. This cross-cultural study (n = 815) sought to investigate perceptions of carbon labels on food amongst youth (18–24 years) from two medium-high CO2-emitting countries in the Americas – Canada and Argentina. Using a mixed methods online survey approach that integrates a quantitative questionnaire with open response questions, we found knowledge deficits in familiarity with the concepts ‘carbon footprint’ and especially ‘carbon label’, and these varied with country, gender, and level of education. Further, exemplars of six food carbon labels, standardized for the carbon emissions information displayed, differed for scores of usefulness, clarity, understanding, confusion, and incomprehensibility. Labels also differed in their relative preference ratings, which varied with education level, with the ‘Traffic light horizontal scale’ the most preferred overall. Our findings inform carbon label design and emissions-related education initiatives, each of which should be optimized for different segments of the youth market in order to effectively promote consumption of lower-carbon foods. © 2023 Institution of Chemical Engineers"

However, the intricacies associated with the design mix process of Geopolymer has been identified as a limiting factor. Thus, in this research, an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted approach for mix design was devised, with the aim of improving the efficiency and precision of the mix design process. The AI model was calibrated utilizing a dataset of experimental Geopolymer Concrete mixes, and subsequently employed to forecast the compressive strength and setting time of newly proposed mix designs. The outcome of the study revealed that the AI-assisted approach significantly enhanced the efficiency of the mix design process and also resulted in more precise predictions of the mechanical properties of the Geopolymer Concrete. Consequently, this study serves as a demonstration of the capability of AI to support sustainable construction by streamlining the process of Geopolymer Concrete mix design. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."

That notwithstanding, its roles in the drives towards environmental sustainability have received commending and reprimanding views in recent times. However, empirical study advancing the asymmetric effects of financial development from the broader view of measures seems limited and evolving. Hence, the present study investigates the positive and negative effects of financial development measured by broad money and domestic credit to the private sector on environmental sustainability (CO2 emissions and ecological footprint) in the Emerging Seven (E7) economies from 1995 to 2019. The empirical evidence considers the intervention of government policy through fiscal policy instruments (government spending and tax revenue), eco-digitalization, affluence, and population growth in a STIRPAT framework. The main analyses focus on advanced estimators such as pool mean group, mean group, dynamic fixed effects, and panel quantile regression. Feedback shows that negative shocks from financial development captured by broad money induce more surges in CO2 emissions. Similarly, the negative shocks from domestic credit to private sectors promote CO2 emissions, while the positive shocks moderate the emissions. The findings also uncover eco-digitalization as a viable tool to achieve environmental sustainability in the E7 economies. Furthermore, the measures of fiscal policy have differing impacts on environmental sustainability as evident from the positive and negative signs attributed to government expenditure and tax revenue. Moreover, affluence and population growth exacerbate CO2 emission surges. Policy insights that drive environmental sustainability are suggested based on the findings. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

The study considers the intervening roles of financial development, economic growth, and population growth from 1996 to 2019. The verification of the empirical hypotheses anchors on advanced estimating techniques comprising cross-sectional dependence autoregressive distributed lag and augmented mean group. Results reveal that natural resource dependence and financial development hinder the attainment of environmental sustainability by inducing significant rise in carbon emissions per capita and ecological footprint. Conversely, digitalization promotes the strides toward environmental sustainability by significantly mitigating the surge in both pollutants. The direct and indirect effects of green energy are observed to sufficiently promote environmental sustainability. Moreover, while economic growth in the selected economies displays a significant level of support for sustainability targets, population growth portrays otherwise. Besides, the country-level analyses anchored on Fully Modified OLS show that natural resource dependence significantly hinders sustainability targets in Russia alone. More so, the existence of EKC finds support in Brazil and Mexico. Policy insights emanate from the findings. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

A farmer can cut down losses in crop production due to aberrant weather conditions by following the weather forecast. The India Meteorological Department is providing a weather forecast on eight weather parameters at district and block level. Under the All India Coordinated Research Project on Agrometeorology-National Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture, an Agromet Advisory Bulletin (AAB) is prepared by using this forecast for the coming five days and disseminated to farmers. To evaluate the impact of AAB in three selected villages, Badoshe Kalan and Bauranga Zer (district Fatehgarh Sahib) and Rampur Fasse (district Rupnagar) a survey of 110 farmers was conducted. Amongst the 110 farmers, 70 were marginal/small farmers (landholding < 2.0ha) and 40 were medium farmers (landholding 2-10ha) who adopted the information given by AAB in crop cultivation. The analysis revealed that by following AAB in rice and wheat crops 65-93% farmers benefitted by managing biotic stresses, 65-85% farmers by irrigation management, 75-78% farmers by adjusting sowing and 62-65% farmers by nutrient management. The farmers who scheduled irrigation for their crops by adopting AAB in the rice-wheat cropping system reduced ~34.2 metric tonnes of CO2 emissions by preventing wasteful burning of diesel. The adopters of AAB in rice and wheat crop were able to harness an average yield increase of 2.25-3.75q/ha and 1.75-4.50 q/ha, respectively and save nearly Rs 4100 to 7000/ha and Rs 3200-9200/ha, respectively with less expenditure. Hence, AAB can help boost crop productivity as well as help reduce carbon footprints and make agriculture an eco-friendly and profitable venture. © 2024, India Meteorological Department.

This lesson learned from the publication of the Shift Project's work in November 2021 has been a catalyst within the healthcare system, accelerating the consideration and implementation of actions aimed at reducing the environmental impact of the healthcare system, before, during and after care. In addition to their carbon footprint, healthcare products have a wide range of environmental impacts, including on water, air and soil, throughout their entire life cycle. We have chosen to divide this life cycle into four main stages: from research and development to production, distribution and market access, use and finally end-of-life management. Analysis of the regulatory framework at each stage and of existing initiatives described in the literature or by those in the field have structured and fuelled our thinking. We found that existing regulations focus exclusively on the health risk, with little or no consideration of the environmental risk, which is in itself a health risk. Furthermore, the implementation of certain structuring actions during the first 3 stages of the life cycle would make it possible to simplify or even eliminate the major problem of waste management associated with the end-of-life of healthcare products. With this in mind, we have produced 9 recommendations to ensure that the environmental impact of healthcare products is better taken into account throughout their life cycle. © 2023 Société française de pharmacologie et de thérapeutique"

The objective of this study was to assess the qualities of biochar, a solid biofuel made from coconut fibres using the carbonisation process. A retort heating system was used to create the biochar, which was then subjected to a number of analytical techniques to assess its physical characteristics. The findings demonstrated that the biochar has better thermal stability than raw biomass and a high resistance to degradation. The biochar is mesoporous and has pore diameters of 3.0 nm and a BET surface area of 167.3 m2/g. The composition analysis of the biochar revealed that it contains a number of inorganic components, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, indicating its usefulness for the creation of fertilisers and the improvement of soil nutrients. The biochar's porous structure and the many pores seen during the morphological study further support its ability to act as an adsorbent. The study aids in the production of solid fuel biochar, which can be used for a variety of applications, as well as waste management associated with increased coconut farming. © 2023 Indian Institute of Chemical Engineers."

The plant-based deep-fried meatball formulated at the ratio of 20:20:20 (T1) was closely related to the mutton deep-fried meatballs in terms of organoleptic properties (colour, texture, juiciness and overall acceptability), colour properties (L* and b*) and textural properties such as hardness, adhesiveness and cohesiveness. These findings will open new research horizons in this area and pave the way for the commercialisation of meat substitutes, which will reduce the environmental impact and carbon footprint. © 2023 Institute of Food, Science and Technology (IFSTTF)."

This study quantitatively assessed the business sustainability and life-cycle-based carbon footprint of a hypothetical plant factory. A system dynamic model was constructed to simulate yearly profit and global warming potential (GWP) of a 2-ha hypothetical farm over 20 years using experimental data from growing 397 Brassica oleracea and 204 Eruca sativa accessions in a prototype plant factory in Singapore. Experimentally derived parameters include resource use data, maximum potential yield improvement, and the effect of increasing planting density on yield. Model simulations predicted that with accession-wide average yield (status quo), the hypothetical plant factory would meet 0.8 % of the leafy vegetable requirement of the population but earn negative profit. The estimated carbon footprint at the end of the simulation period was approximately 21 kg CO2-eq per kg of vegetables with lighting operations being the major contributor. A univariate-sensitivity analysis was conducted to understand how model parameters could affect the plant factory's profit represented by net present value (NPV) and environmental sustainability represented by GWP. Yield improvement was identified as the strongest influencer of NPV followed by price elasticity and annual fluctuations in vegetable price. Yield improvement was also the strongest influencer of GWP followed by planting density and unit light use. This study acknowledged the importance of crop breeding in plant factories' profit and environmental sustainability. The results indicated breeding high-quality unique varieties with improved yield and light use efficiency can potentially benefit plant factories' business and environmental sustainability. © 2023 The Author(s)"

In the past, SUDs mainly consisted of equipment such as guidewires and catheters. However, SUDs have now expanded to flexible endoscopes and energy devices that are much more expensive. Reuse of such devices raises concerns of infection transmission, safety, and lack of effectiveness. We reviewed the disinfection process, cost benefits, potential harms, and legal status of the reuse of SUDs in endourology. Materials and Methods: PUBMED, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched for articles published between 1970 and March 2023 that reported the reuse of SUDs using the search terms ‘‘reuse’’; ‘‘single-use device’’; ‘‘disposable medical devices’’; ‘‘reprocessing of single-use device’’; ‘‘endourology’’; and keywords related to cost, safety, sterilization, and legal status. Online resources were found using Google search engines. Articles on cost savings, device malfunction, disinfection, or legal status in different countries were reviewed. Results and Conclusions: Reusing SUDs has financial, environmental, and practical advantages. The potential savings on medical expenses is the most compelling argument for reprocessing disposable devices. Reusing medical equipment also contributes to the reduction of toxic biodegradable waste. However, there is a scarcity of data on the safety and efficacy of reused SUDs. For patient safety and to avoid complications, the practice must be regulated with established reprocessing standards. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc."

Solar thermal energy is a viable option for industrial process heating applications to mitigate the utilization of conventional fossil fuels. The utilization of solar energy in the process industries to meet their energy demands helps to reduce the carbon footprint, and eventually will help India balance its energy needs by reducing the import of crude oil. The exploitation of solar energy in the process industries requires the assessment of future thermal energy demands. In this study, since the data points were nonlinear in nature, support vector regression (SVR) and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms were applied to forecast the thermal energy demands of various process industries. The process industries considered in this study were textile, food processing, leather and footwear, chemical and pharmaceutical, dairy, iron and steel, and automotive. Data from 1998 to 2014 were used for training and data from 2015 to 2017 were used for testing. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was used as a performance measure metric to measure the performance of the SVR and LSTM algorithms. The average MAPEs obtained for given industries by the SVR with the genetic algorithm (SVRGA), SVR with grid search (SVRGS), and LSTM algorithm were 7.56%, 8.34%, and 11.10% respectively. The SVRGA outperformed the SVRGS and LSTM algorithm for the given training and testing data. © 2024 by Begell House, Inc."

Four concrete mixtures by replacing the cement with 5, 10, 15, and 20% of pozzolan by weight were considered. The compressive, X-ray Diffraction Analysis (XRD), and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) tests have been used to examine the mechanical properties, microstructural analysis, and morphology of proposed concrete mixtures to evaluate the impact of using local mineral pozzolan. According to the results, the best replacement ratio of this pozzolan in the concrete is equal to 15% by weight of the cement, which enhances the strength by 24% compared to the ordinary cement concrete. The chemical reaction of pozzolan in the concrete binder reduced the content of portlandite and calcite. This pozzolan also decreased the number of pores and enhanced the integrity of the interfacial transition zone (ITZ) in the concrete compared to ordinary (Portland) cement concrete. Also, this pozzolan emits less CO2, 15.20 kg/m3, than ordinary cement concrete. Due to the effects of this pozzolan in Structural strengthening and reducing cement consumption in concrete, the study may introduce Asiabar mineral pozzolan as an environmentally friendly cement replacing agent with the potential to enhance the strength of concrete. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

In the experiment, some participants had the opportunity to voluntarily commit to a low carbon footprint basket before their online grocery shopping; the commitment was forced upon other participants. We also study the impact of an online badge as a soft reward for the achievement of a low carbon footprint basket. Participants from the general population shopped over two weeks, with the experimental stimuli only in week 2; and received their shopping baskets and any unspent budget. Results indicate that requesting a commitment prior to entering the store leads to a reduction in carbon footprint of 9–12%. When the commitment is voluntary, reductions are driven by consumers who accept the commitment. Commitments also reduced the consumption of fats and, for forced commitments, that of salt by 18%. Badges did not significantly impact consumer behaviour. Commitment mechanisms, either forced or voluntary, appear effective in motivating an environmental goal and search for low-carbon options, particularly in those accepting the commitment. © 2023, The Author(s)."

If these behaviors persist, drawing riders to more sustainable modes may be more difficult. This study investigates measures how crowding multipliers in New York City for the subway, ridehailing, and microtransit changed during and after the pandemic. We used Bayesian techniques to estimate two mixed logit models based on stated preference data. Results show that post-pandemic crowding multipliers are either similar or lower than during the pandemic, depending on the transportation mode and masking compliance. Additionally, vaccination requirements did not significantly affect respondents’ choices, but respondents were willing to pay to reduce their transportation mode's carbon footprint. The study suggests that commuters’ aversion to crowding will gradually decrease, but whether crowding multipliers will return to pre-pandemic levels or a post-pandemic ”new normal” remains uncertain. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

For this reason the world banking regulation standards-setter – the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) – suggested considering pricing in the climate risk and adopting its relevant regulation. It listed input–output tables as one of the key tools to measure the climate riskiness of a borrower. However, most of the prior research considered carbon dioxide emissions when applying input–output tables. Same time there is a significant volume of research focusing on climate (or environmental) risk ratings. Nevertheless, both approaches might present only part of the larger climate-related financial risk implications. That is why, our research purpose is to develop full climate risk estimate by leveraging on the input–output tables and climate risk ratings. By doing so, we intend to demonstrate when the existing approaches yield sufficient information to make financial risk-related decision and when those should be improved by considering full climate risk justified in the current paper. The novelty of this work is the amalgamation of a known data source on environmental (climate) risk scores from Sustainalytics.com with the world input–output database (WIOD) for 2000–2014. The major finding of ours is that the greenness of industries is materially perturbed when considering WIOD-based full climate risk estimates as follows from an equivalent to the Leontief full production costs. We specifically find that aluminium as a commodity occurs much'browner’ from full climate risk perspective, than it seems from the marginal climate risk one. Hence, the steps taken by Australia to reduce aluminium production are necessary, but not sufficient. For the global welfare China has adopt a negative emission target (i.e., reduce more carbon dioxide, than is produced) to attain the objective of noticeable improvement in the global carbon footprint, particularly the one related to aluminium production.

Carbon reduction has been widely advocated to mitigate the climate crisis. The endoscopy unit is the third highest waste-generating department in a hospital. The awareness and acceptance of the practice of green endoscopy among healthcare workers is unclear. Method: An online survey was conducted over a 5-week period from July to August 2023 in the Asia-Pacific region, which targeted endoscopists, nurses, and other healthcare professionals of the endoscopy unit. The primary outcome was the agreement to adopt green endoscopy. The secondary outcomes included views on sustainable practices, factors associated with increased acceptance of green endoscopy, the acceptance of different carbon reduction measures, and the perceived barriers to implementation. Results: A total of 259 valid responses were received. Overall, 79.5% of participants agreed to incorporate green endoscopy into their practice. Nevertheless, existing green policies were only reported by 12.7% of respondents. The level of understanding of green endoscopy is the only significant factor associated with its acceptance (odds ratio 3.10, P < 0.007). Potential barriers to implementation include healthcare cost increment, infection risk, inadequate awareness, and lack of policy and industrial support. Conclusion: Green endoscopy is well accepted among healthcare workers but not widely implemented. The level of understanding is highly associated with its acceptance, highlighting the importance of education. A reliable assessment tool is needed to quantify the environmental impact of endoscopy. Further studies are needed to ascertain its benefit and cost effectiveness. © 2023 The Authors.

Traditional stabilization methods that employ calcium-based stabilizers are widely used mitigate the volume change-related distresses, but they increase the carbon footprint and emission of greenhouse gases during production and construction stages, compromising the treatment’s sustainability. This research study was designed to use silica-rich waste products, such as a quarry dust admixture with a calcium-based stabilizer, to enhance the performance of problematic soils and improve the sustainability of the system. An array of engineering tests, including unconfined compressive strength tests before and after moisture conditioning, one-dimensional free swell tests, and linear shrinkage tests, were performed on untreated and treated soils. Test results showed that the utilization of quarry dust as a co-additive significantly improved the strength and durability of the soil and reduced the shrink-swell potential to a greater extent than lime treatment alone. The sustainability assessment was then performed, which showed that the application of quarry dust can be considered a sustainable alternative that helps reduce the geoenvironmental problems related to handling and stockpiling waste products in landfills. Overall, silica-rich waste products have the potential to be appropriate and sustainable additives that work well with a traditional calcium-based stabilizer to modify expansive soil.

Nevertheless, few researches simultaneously address the issue from different perspectives of carbon, water and energy as well as their temporal variations. Herein, a systematic cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment of maize production was conducted with a case study in Shandong, China. Different midpoint and endpoint indices including 10-year average data from 2011 to 2020 and their temporal variations were investigated. The contribution analysis of different processes to these indices revealed that irrigation dominated the midpoint of water scarcity, whereas the sum of direct consumption, fertilizer and diesel production contributed more than 80% to all the other indices. The sensitivity analysis also illustrated that these environmental indices can be reduced by as high as 4% when the aforementioned inputs were individually decreased by 5%. The temporal variation of the global warming potential, aquatic eutrophication and fossil depletion demonstrated that all the three indices were decreased by about 25.0%–31.7% over the last decade. Further persistent efforts to enhance mechanized operation efficiency and explore green and efficient methods for fertilizer and diesel production were highlighted. Moreover, implementations of rational agricultural management such as scientific fertilization and water-efficient irrigation were suggested, in order to have an eco-friendly maize production system. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

The environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis was used as a theoretical framework. By applying the mean group dynamic least squares (DOLSMG) estimation approach and using carbon and greenhouse gas emissions as environmental indicators, the outcome validates the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis but only in the United States and Germany. Material productivity, footprint and intensity exert a significantly negative impact on the environmental indicators, thus demonstrating the existence of a feasible sustainable consumption and production approach among the countries. By contrast, especially for the country-specific results, material productivity and intensity aggravated environmental degradation by increasing carbon and greenhouse gas emissions in France, Italy, and Japan. A robustness check using the Dumitrescu-Hurlin Granger causality approach aligns with the above-mentioned results. The findings suggest policy recommendations for a more effective approach to reducing material intensification across economic sectors in advanced economies. © 2023 The Author(s).

The optimal level of urban density from a carbon reduction perspective at the city level has been much debated. However, considering possible trade-offs or co-benefits for CFs in the housing and travel sectors, it remains difficult to evaluate how intra-urban/residential densities and mixed land-use patterns relate to individual CFs at a community level in different seasons. The study objective was to demonstrate the changes in the CFs of residents in summer and winter according to spatiotemporal changes in urban forms, such as intra-urban/residential densities and mixed land-use patterns. Based on geographical data and CF survey results from Seoul and Gyeonggi in 2009 and 2018, four path analysis models were used to verify the spatiotemporal variances of the relationships between urban forms and the CFs of the housing/travel sectors (HCF/TCF). Path analysis with a set of mediation variables enables the evaluation of possible trade-offs, or co-benefits, when investigating the impacts of different measures of intra-urban densities and mixed land-use patterns on the CFs. Furthermore, the moderating effects of different cooling and heating patterns in different seasons on CFs were verified by comparing the four path analysis models in different spatiotemporal contexts. The results showed spatiotemporal changes in urban density and different impacts of urban and residential densities on the TCF. It was also revealed that a low percentage of residential land use in urbanized areas offsets the advantage of high density in reducing TCF and HCF. Seasonal differences were also observed in the effects of residential density and HCF. The results of this study help us understand the spatiotemporal characteristics of TCF and HCF in urban settings, which can assist efforts to achieve carbon neutrality goals. © The Author(s) 2023."

This study investigates the drivers of the perceived value of food RSs consumption by proposing a model that establishes via PLS-SEM (n = 253) a positive relationship between the Yuka company’s food RecSys’ epistemic value and its perceived value. The model demonstrates that Yuka RecSys’ epistemic value relies on the disciplinary drivers of compatibility, self-confidence, and consumer innovativeness, and the problematising drivers of memory and learning, which come from using the application. The perceived value of food RecSys is found to relate to RecSys epistemic value beyond the functional accuracy aspects of recommendation algorithms. Results highlight the importance of developing a refined understanding of epistemic value considering the consumption of RecSys. RecSys’ developers, retailers, food manufacturers and policy makers must work on better mapping and adjusting information through consumers socialised RecSys’ usage to shape the design of the next generation RecSys. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

We studied carbon management in universities, institutions with large carbon footprints and considerable influence in climate science and policy fora. However, concerns that VCOs may deter adopters (including universities) from adopting other carbon reduction measures and limit emissions reductions, for example, through moral hazard, have been raised but understudied. We compared the carbon management characteristics (priorities, policies, practices and emissions) of universities that did and did not adopt VCOs. We found adopters measured carbon emissions for longer, and had set targets to reach net zero earlier than had non-adopters. Adopters of VCOs also undertook more carbon management practices in both 2010 and 2020 than non-adopters. We also found that both adopters and non-adopters significantly increased their carbon management practices over the decade studied, but with no difference between groups. Gross CO2 emissions were reduced significantly over time by adopters of VCOs but not by non-adopters, whereas carbon intensity and percentage annual emissions reductions did not relate to adoption status. Consequently, our study showed no indication of mitigation deterrence due to adoption of VCOs at the universities studied. Rather, greater emissions reductions correlated with earlier net zero target dates, and a higher number of policies and carbon management practices. However, our study was constrained to universities that were affiliated with a national environmental network, so research beyond these organizations, and with individuals, would be useful. The survey was voluntary, exposing the study to potential self-selection bias so the findings may not be generalized beyond the study group. Finally, we found the carbon accounting method currently required of universities for scope 1 and 2 emissions may underestimate emissions reductions, particularly for adopters of VCOs. Augmenting the current location-based accounting method with market-based carbon accounts may overcome this. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

They have great potential to be incorporated into inorganic matrices and produce insulating materials. However, there is a lack of information about the flammability of these materials. This work presents the results of an experimental investigation of the fire behaviour of bio-based materials. In this study, wastes of bamboo, wood shavings and rice husk were used and were evaluated for their fire performance in the natural state and after treatment in an alkaline solution. The fire reaction properties were determined by using a Mass Loss Cone Calorimeter in order to obtain the parameters of heat release rate (HRR), total heat released (THR), effective heat of combustion (EHC), total mass loss (TML), ignition time (IT) and time of combustion (TC). In addition, physical characterization and thermogravimetric tests were carried out as well as scanning electron microscopy analyses. The results show that the alkaline treatment of the bio-based aggregates is able to reduce the average HRR and the EHC of all bio-aggregates but does not delay the ignition of these materials. Among the residues studied, rice husk presented the lowest peaks and averages of HRR, THR, total mass loss, EHC and time to flameout; however, the ignition occurred faster. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

On the other side, extensive research is being conducted on accelerated carbonation treatment to decrease the industry’s carbon footprint. Carbonation transforms CO2 into carbonate minerals. This study investigates the influence of accelerated carbonation on the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of soil stabilized with alkali-activated slag under ambient and oven curing conditions. Effects of curing time, binder content, relative density, and carbonation pressure (100, 200, and 300 kPa) were also studied. Furthermore, a calcimeter test was conducted to determine the amount of carbonate generated, which reflects CO2 sequestration in soil. The results showed that the carbonated samples achieved higher strength than the non-carbonated samples. However, a slight decrease in UCS was observed with the increase in CO2 pressure. The generated carbonate content directly correlated with the UCS of the samples, which explained the higher strength of carbonated samples. Also, the ambient curing condition was more favorable for the samples stabilized with GGBS, which can be attributed to the supply of required moisture. Results from XRD, SEM, and FTIR indicated that the strength development was due mainly to the formation of carbonation products (CaCO3), which facilitated the densification of solidified materials. © The Author(s) 2023."

This research aims to diminish the NOx dilemma for diesel and biodiesel by utilizing straight-run naphtha as an additive. It has a low carbon footprint of production from light distilled crude oil without any requirement for the thermal cracking process. The diesel was blended with naphtha at percentages of 5%, 10%, and 15% that abbreviated by N5, N10, and N15, respectively. The biodiesel/diesel blend was mixed with the same naphtha concentrations forming the blends B30N5, B30N10, and B30N15, respectively. Experiments were applied on a single-cylinder engine at 2,000 rpm and different loads. The findings revealed that N15 declined the brake specific fuel consumption (bsfc) at most loads relative to neat diesel. Contrarily, biodiesel blends reflected a spiking trend of bsfc at tested loads. Notably, the NOx emissions declined with N15 blend at high loads relative to neat diesel. The blends B30N15 and B30N10 reduced NOx at high loads compared to the diesel/biodiesel blend. The straight-run naphtha was found to be a promising additive because the balanced composition of the iso-paraffins and n-paraffins. Hence, it dominated the ignition tendency and reduced NOx emissions due to its cooling effect. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Quarterly observations from 1998-2020 have been utilized for the advanced-panel model entitled Method of Moments Quantile Regression (MMQR). The initial findings confirm slope heterogeneity, interdependence between the cross-sectional units, stationarity properties, and panel cointegration. The results through FM-OLS, D-OLS, and FE-OLS justify that energy innovations, digital trade, and environmental regulations control ecological damages. In contrast, economic freedom and growth are causing more damage to nature, like ecological footprints (EFP). Similarly, the results through MMQR confirm that the impact of energy innovations, digital trade, and environmental regulations is accepted as a panacea to control environmental degradation in G7. However, the magnitude of the coefficient varies across different quantiles. More specifically, the findings show that the impact of energy innovations is highly significant at 0.50th quantile. In contrast, through digital trade, the impact on EFP is only significant under medium and higher order quantiles (i.e. 0.50th, 0.75th-1.0th). Contrarily, economic freedom is causing more EFP across all the quantiles, where the findings are highly significant at 0.75th quantile.

Estimating the size of unmet social needs reveals abysmal distances between current service provision and a set of benchmarks. The huge size of these gaps reflects the lack of priority given to these services in the various national development projects of the past. In turn, the measurement of benefits, carried out with the help of the 2019 Brazilian Input Output Tables (IOTs), and the generation of an environmental matrix based on the IOTs, reveals that investments in these areas are key opportunities for promoting sustainable development. The greater capacity for galvanizing the economy and generating formal employment, and the smaller carbon footprint of public education and health services when compared to the average for the economy, stand out. Additionally, in comparison with the private social services provision network, public services stand out in terms of average wages, collection of taxes and contributions, formal employment, income multipliers and formal employment, and greenhouse gas emissions per unit of wage. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

As the backbone of the modern economy, it offers subscription-based computing services anytime, anywhere, on a pay-as-you-go basis. Its use is growing exponentially with the continued development of new classes of applications driven by a huge number of emerging networked devices. However, the success of Cloud computing has created a new global energy challenge, as it comes at the cost of vast energy usage. Currently, data centres hosting Cloud services world-wide consume more energy than most countries. Globally, by 2025, they are projected to consume 20% of global electricity and emit up to 5.5% of the world's carbon emissions. In addition, a significant part of the energy consumed is transformed into heat which leads to operational problems, including a reduction in system reliability and the life expectancy of devices, and escalation in cooling requirements. Therefore, for the future generations of Cloud computing to address the environmental and operational consequences of such significant energy usage, they must become energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable while continuing to deliver high-quality services. In this article, we propose a vision for learning-centric approach for the integrated management of new generation Cloud computing environments to reduce their energy consumption and carbon footprint while delivering service quality guarantees.

To address this issue, we introduce a novel price vector design, the reference-price-informed (RP-informed) design, which directly incorporates individual's reference prices into discrete choice experiments. By presenting consumers with posted prices that align with their expected prices, this design reflects real-world food markets. We test this design in a discrete choice experiment evaluating consumer preferences for “low carbon” beef. Our results project a very small market share of low-carbon ribeye (3%–5%) with conventional meat taking up most of the market. Our results also show that a reference-price-informed design reduces reference price uncertainty and leads to more conservative market share estimates than traditional designs, thus preventing the potential overestimation of product's market potential. © 2023 The Authors.

However, due to the high contents of cement and silica fume usually necessaries for achieving this packing density, UHPC's final cost and carbon-footprint are far higher than standard concretes. Therefore, over the last few years, the spotlight of UHPC’s research has focused sharply on the analysis of locally available supplementary cementitious materials as partial replacement of cement and silica fume. This article presents an investigation to analyze the effect of rice husk ash (RHA) as partial substitution of cement in a previously optimized mixture of recycled-glass-UHPC by means of several statistical tools. Cementitious materials employed in this research involved silica fume, limestone powder, recycled glass powder and ordinary Portland cement (OPC). Based on the results, it can be concluded that RHA addition in the optimized glass UPHC yields to a significant decrease in the workability of concrete and a slight decrease of compressive strength. Results also demonstrated the high interaction between the RHA and water contents, which could be ascribed to the water absorption and internal curing provided by RHA particles. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

However, EVs may still cause carbon emissions in the power sector if they are charged by electricity generated from burning fossil fuels like coal. Researchers have focused on managing emissions on the power generation sector. However, the underlying driver of carbon emissions is the demand of consumers. Given this background, a probabilistic carbon footprint management strategy is proposed for EVs in this paper. First, the conventional deterministic carbon emission flow model is extended to a probabilistic one (PCEF) to track the carbon footprint of EVs considering various kinds of uncertainties based on non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) and the two-point estimation method (2PEM). Second, a stochastic chance-constrained carbon footprint management model for EV charging is presented to address the carbon obligation allocation of EVs from the perspective of consumption and provide a technical basis for demand-driven stimulation to reduce carbon emissions. Third, an efficient method is proposed to solve the formulated chance-constrained problem based on nonparametric Bayesian modeling and inference. The proposed model and method are demonstrated by the IEEE 39-bus power system. The feasibility of the proposed PCEF model is validated. According to simulation results, the computation speed of the proposed PCEF model is enhanced from 3456.8 seconds to 1341.3 seconds compared with the Monte Carlo simulation by sacrificing the accuracy within 2%. Besides, the proposed emission control strategy can attain a better emission control performance compared with the other state-of-art methods.  © 2010-2012 IEEE."

Geosynthetics are used to improve soil structures such as base courses or retaining walls, mostly through reinforcement, filtration, separation, and sealing functions. This paper examines the environmental and economic benefits of using geosynthetics in road, earthworks, and foundation engineering. The paper discusses soil reinforcement of base courses, construction of retaining walls, and sealing layers. One of the main environmental benefits of using geosynthetics is the reduction in the use of natural or manufactured resources such as concrete. Traditional construction methods often require excavation and transportation of large quantities of soil, rock, and other materials. By contrast, geosynthetics can be used to enhance the properties of existing soils, minimizing the need for additional materials. This significantly reduces the carbon footprint and improves the sustainability of construction projects. Case studies are presented to illustrate the benefits of geosynthetics in practice. The paper concludes that geosynthetics can provide significant environmental and economic benefits in construction and should be widely considered in construction projects. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG. 2024."

There is apprehension about preserving an uncontaminated atmosphere and attaining optimal nuclear and geothermal energy utilization with agriculture sector development. In this regard, this paper investigates the influence of nuclear energy, geothermal energy, agriculture development, and urbanization on carbon emissions and ecological footprint from 1990Q1 to 2019Q4 in the case of China. The findings of unit root tests reveal that all variables are stationary at first integration order, and cointegration test findings confirm the presence of long-run relationships among series. The quantile autoregressive distributive lag (QARDL) method findings demonstrate that nuclear energy, geothermal energy, and urbanization statistically correlate with CO2 emissions and ecological footprint across all quantiles, indicating that these determinants have contributed to environmental degradation. Whereas agricultural development has a statistically significant and negative influence on the environment, implying that agriculture has a pollution-mitigation impact. Based on these empirical findings, several policy implications are presented to preserve environmental quality to achieve the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) target. © 2023 International Association for Gondwana Research"

Forests in Northern Portugal are characterized by a remarkable diversity of ecosystems and provide habitat for an enormous diversity of living organisms. This study aims to investigate whether and to what extent protected areas and forest typology (native vs. exotic) affect soil nematode biodiversity and functions in forest ecosystems. We studied soil nematode communities, which have been widely used for their bioindicator value, to: (i) assess differences in soil biodiversity and functions between protected and non-protected areas, and between native and exotic forest types; and (ii) infer how protected areas deal with pressures and drivers of soil biodiversity and functions. We showed that current work done by nature conservation in Northern Portugal is producing some significant effects on the soil system, showing a larger Structure and Omnivore footprints and greater abundance of fungivorous and omnivorous nematodes in protected areas. Furthermore, native forest areas are better suited to ensure soil biodiversity and ecological functioning and should have a greater importance in nature conservation measures. Soil organic carbon, apparent density, soil moisture, and deciduous forest cover mainly influenced soil functional biodiversity with higher nematode trophic groups being positively associated with soil organic carbon and moisture and negatively associated with apparent density. Finally, conservation efforts targeted at the protection of native forests need to better consider effects on soil biodiversity and function, to provide an integrated protection of both aboveground and belowground components. © The Author(s) 2023."

On the other hand, concrete has several potential environmental impacts including global warming due to CO2 emissions and energy demand and water scarcity due to water consumption for its production. Therefore, it is crucial to assess environmental concerns in concrete production for sustainable construction. Low emissions advanced performance (LEAP) concrete uses fillers – fine particulates that are inert when mixed with water and cement – as binder replacement to reduce CO2 emissions and energy consumption. The dilution of binder by a high amount of filler can be compensated by reducing the volume of mixing water needed to achieve concrete desired rheological behavior through packing techniques combined with chemical admixtures -superplasticizers- for adequate particle dispersion. This technology achieves the required compressive strength and rheology while reducing cement’s CO2 emissions. This study estimates and compares the water to produce LEAP and conventional concrete in order to complement their environmental profile. Water for aggregates and cement production is considered in addition to mixing water. The results are estimated in ranges to include variations due to technological routes. Primary data are used for the LEAP and conventional concrete formulations and data from the industry are used for the water activities other than concrete mixing. The results show LEAP concrete to have slightly lower water consumption than conventional concrete which together with low CO2 emissions suggests that this is a potential solution for sustainable construction, however, further analysis is needed. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG. 2024."

Most techniques involve the use of ceramic powders embedded in an organic binder which is typically removed through a slow thermal debinding process. Herein, we prove for the first time that ultra-rapid debinding and sintering are possible for complex 3YSZ components produced using material extrusion technology. The printed components were first chemically debinded in acetone thus removing about one-half of the binder, and then thermally debinded and densified by ultrafast high-temperature sintering (UHS) in a single-step process (30–120 s). Fully dense components were obtained with tailored microstructure and nanometric grain size. The sintered artefacts were crack-free even at the microscopic level. This approach paves the way for rapid processing (debinding and sintering) of additively manufactured ceramics with reduced energy consumption and carbon footprint. © 2023 The Authors"

Hence, exploring novel approaches to repurpose this waste and mitigate its environmental footprint holds significance. This work objective is to transform EAF into a low-cost catalyst and possibly minimize the environmental liability due to its disposal in the soil. Amphiphilic materials were produced using EAF dust coated with carbon structures (EAF/C). The materials were synthesized by chemical vapor deposition at 700, 800, and 900 ℃ using ethanol as the carbon source. X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy analyses suggested that a reduced iron phase was produced by ethanol oxidation, producing carbon structures and iron. The materials showed amphiphilic features and exhibited remarkable magnetic due to iron metallic presence. The materials have strongly interacted with polar, nonpolar, and biphasic mediums. The EAF/C were utilized as biphasic media catalysts for benzyl alcohol oxidation and quinoline, consuming up to 43% of benzyl alcohol and 60% of quinoline. The benzyl alcohol oxidation presented 97% of selectivity for the aldehyde product. The biphasic oxidation Nt-butyl-α-phenylnitrone verified that the materials play a fundamental role in the catalytic transfer of hydroxyl radicals generated from the aqueous to the organic phase. The materials were also tested for oxidation of dye compounds, presenting the removal of 100%. The tests showed that the EAF can be used to obtain novel and efficient catalysts for oxidation processes. © Iranian Chemical Society 2023."

The prediction of N2O emissions from Water Resource Recovery Facilities (WRRFs) was evaluated by three different mass-transfer models using Benchmark Simulation Model 1 (BSM1) as a reference model. Inappropriate selection of mass-transfer model may result in miscalculation of carbon footprints based on soluble N2O online measurements. The film theory considers a constant mass-transfer expression, while more complex models suggest that emissions are affected by the aeration type, efficiency, and tank design characteristics. The differences among model predictions were 10–16% at dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration of 0.6 g/m3, when biological N2O production was the highest, while the flux of N2O was 20.0–24 kg N2O-N/d. At lower DO, the nitrification rate was low, while at DO higher than 2 g/m3, the N2O production was reduced leading to higher rates of complete nitrification and a flux of 5 kg N2O-N/d. The differences increased to 14–26% in deeper tanks, due to the pressure assumed in the tanks. The predicted emissions are also affected by the aeration efficiency when K L a N2O depends on the airflow instead of the K L a O2. Increasing the nitrogen loading rate under DO concentration of 0.50–0.65 g/m3 increased the differences in predictions by 10–20% in both alpha 0.6 and 1.2. A sensitivity analysis indicated that the selection of different mass-transfer models did not affect the selection of biochemical parameters for N2O model calibration. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

The industrial utilization of these compounds requires the development of green, efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable extraction protocols. Therefore, this study focused on the optimization of microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) process variables using Face-Centered Central Composite Design (FC-CCD). Then, maceration was applied as a conventional technique, and these techniques were compared in terms of extraction efficiency, morphological changes, antimicrobial activities, carbon emissions, and energy consumption. As a result, optimal MAE conditions, i.e., EtOH: water ratio (X1) = 100:0, liquid/sample ratio (X2) = 30:1 mL/g, microwave power (X3) = 300 W, and irradiation time (X4) = 5 min, were obtained with AL and IAL yields of 54.99 ± 0.11 (mg/g) and 48.40 ± 0.19 (mg/g), respectively. The extract obtained by MAE had similar or better activity than positive controls in most cases and formed the largest inhibition zones against E. coli (29.5 ± 0.71 mm) and A. niger (34.75 ± 1.06 mm). Morphological changes of I. helenium roots after extraction were observed by scanning electron microscopy. Additionally, MAE was 43.4 times faster than maceration, resulting in 228.6 times less energy consumption and carbon emissions. Based on these findings, it is recommended to use MAE as an industrial green technique for the extraction of sesquiterpene lactones with potential applications in nutraceuticals and food products in terms of sustainable economy and environmental protection. © 2023 The Authors.

The buildings were analysed and designed with the same aspect ratio and loading with two structural systems; Reinforced concrete (RC) framed and Shear wall type. The computation was performed for floor area, building volume, and concrete quantity. The results show that for the same grade of concrete, compared with conventional concrete (CC), GPC's EE is reduced by 46%, ECO2e is reduced by 42%, and the cost is reduced by 7%. The primary energy consumption (EET) and CO2 emissions (ECO2eT) towards material transportation in GPC shear wall and framed structures are 8% lower and associated cost is 22% cheaper than CC buildings. Compared to CC, the total primary EE and ECO2e of GPC RC shear wall and framed buildings are 46 and 55% lower, respectively.

PPE kits are made of a non-biodegradable material which is hazardous to human health as well as aquatic life and the environment. With the addition of more paper industries, waste generation is rapidly rising. The majority of the Paper industry's sludge is sent to the landfill site which produces harmful gases (CO2 and methane) that leads to global warming. Consequently, it is necessary to manage such waste through sustainable means. This study focuses on the use of COVID-19 Non-woven PPE Kits including face masks (single use, surgical, N-95, etc.), and head cover with paper industry sludge for the fabrication of sustainable unfired brick. The 9 steps of sustainable unfired brick fabrication include disinfection of waste, mixing and crushing waste, moulding, demoulding, and drying unfired brick. Water absorption and compressive strength test were performed on fabricated unfired brick.

Therefore, the main objective of this work is focused to reduce the carbon footprint in DRI production by eliminating fossil fuel consumption. The reduced iron could be used to melt in the electric arc furnace (EAF) to produce liquid steel by minimising direct scrap addition. Indeed, this paper shows an advanced physical model of a hydrogen fuel shaft furnace for the direct reduced iron-making process by fundamental development of technology with essential modifications in its working principle. This processing technology is hypothetically designed with knowledge of theoretical literature inputs and wisdom of iron and steel-making experience. In this model of a shaft furnace, a scientific approach is designed based on the dissociation of molecular-hydrogen gas (H2+) obtained by water electrolysis and ionisation of the hydrogen gas (2H+) and is incorporated for a high degree of gas adsorption and metallisation during chemical reduction of iron ore (Fe2O3) pellets. The steps involved in the working principle of the new design shaft furnace are simulated and modelled suitably for the existing Midrex furnace operation, which is generally used for DRI production. This approach could be tried using 100% dissociated hydrogen ionic gas (2H+, H+) for future direct reduced iron making by water electrolysis and hydrogen ionisation. Moreover, the reformed reducing gases (CH4–H2–CO) used in the Midrex process can be replaced by the ionised hydrogen gases as an advancement. © 2023 Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum."

Hence, this study aims to bridge this gap by investigating the barriers that are critical to the minimization of construction carbon footprint in the UK. A questionnaire was developed based on the carbon reduction barrier variables identified through a comprehensive literature review and pilot study. Then a survey was conducted amongst construction professionals in the UK and the data obtained were analyzed using mean ranking technique and factor analysis. The mean ranking analysis gave rise to 15 critical barriers to carbon reduction and their factor analysis yielded four dissimilar factors which are, resources and prioritization; policy and standards; risk and commitment; and awareness and complexity. The findings imply that these classifications can be used to describe carbon reduction barriers in the UK. This could stimulate a better comprehension of the critical barriers and provide a foundational basis for further research within the sustainable construction domain. Also, the result of this study could facilitate the need for collaboration between construction stakeholders in the UK to proffer pragmatic solutions to the identified challenges of carbon minimization. © 2023 The Author(s).

However, existing climate change assessment indexes still have some limitations, such as insufficient consideration of policy response, limited coverage of countries, and lack of a multidimensional perspective. In this study, we developed a novel climate change impacts and responses (CCIR) index that incorporates comprehensive information on climate risks, disease burden, and mitigation actions in response to climate risks and damage. To our best knowledge, the CCIR index is the first of its kind that explores variations in climate risks, impacts, and responses across countries to identify vulnerabilities and find more targeted solutions. A positive correlation was found between the CCIR index and national Gross Domestic Product per capita, indicating that wealthier countries might allocate more resources toward mitigating climate impacts. Moreover, countries with better climate education tended to have a lower carbon footprint, highlighting the importance of climate education. Furthermore, countries with lower risks of emerging infectious diseases were more likely to consume more renewable energy. The results highlight the value of using a multidimensional CCIR framework to analyze the interactions among socioeconomic factors, environmental policies, and climate change risks in 158 countries. This comprehensive approach provides actionable insights to mitigate climate impacts and improve national climate resilience. It also streamlines monitoring efforts and promotes joint climate action across international boundaries. By identifying climate risks and opportunities, the CCIR index can help policymakers design, refine, and implement adaptation policies and measures to respond to the impacts of climate change. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Reducing sintering temperature and shortening dwelling time are significant to the reduction of carbon footprint. It has been reported that utilizing mesoporous particles as raw powder for sintering is a promising strategy to achieve the above goal. The goal of this study is to verify if this strategy also works for the sintering of ZrO2–SiO2 glass-ceramics. We synthesized mesoporous particles through a micelle-assisted co-precipitation process, followed by sintering by fast hot pressing (FHP) and pressureless sintering (PS) to obtain ZrO2–SiO2 glass-ceramics. For comparison, solid particles without mesopores were synthesized by a sol-gel method and consolidated by the two sintering techniques. The densification behaviors of the two types of particles were comparatively investigated. Results showed that the mesopores collapsed at ∼850 °C during FHP due to the applied pressure, which resulted in a peak densification rate during the whole sintering process. The mesoporous particles (∼820 °C) had a lower densification starting temperature than that of the solid particles (∼910 °C). However, the mesoporous particles showed a longer densification process and a lower average densification rate than those of the solid particles. The samples sintered from mesoporous particles showed a heterogeneous microstructure, predominately consisting of ZrO2 nanocrystallites embedded in a SiO2 matrix, but in some regions ZrO2 sub-microcrystallites were connected with each other by grain boundaries, without the presence of SiO2 matrix. During PS, there was not significant differences in the densification between the mesoporous particles and the solid ones. These results demonstrated that the mesoporous particles did not show significant advantages over solid ones, in terms of the densification of ZrO2–SiO2 glass-ceramics. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l."

Based on site requirements, soils are amended with synthetic cementitious materials to improve their strength. However, synthetic binders such as cementation, geo-polymerization, and bio-cementation under-mine thermal insulation while improving strength. Moreover, commonly used synthetic binders such as cement and lime are extremely harmful to the geoenvironment due to their hyper-alkalinity and high carbon footprint. Therefore, this study pro-poses a novel backfill composite consisting of clay loam, biochar, and biopolymer for superior thermal insulation and strength characteristics. Local soil containing high clay content was chosen due to its low thermal conductivity and potential to form stable hydrogen bonding with the biopolymer. The clay loam is amended with 2.5% to 7.5% (w/w) biochar and 0.5% to 1.5% (w/w) of biopolymer and their various combinations. Out of nine soil–biochar–biopolymer composites devised in the current study, six composites exhibited superior strength and lowered thermal conductivity than the plain soil in both conditions, i.e., optimum moisture state and upon drying. The findings of this study establish the synergistic attributes of biopolymer and biochar amendment for developing a high-strength thermal-insulating soil composite. © 2024 The Author(s)."

There is a pressing need for sustainable transport systems, as the type of transportation used contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. This challenge is exacerbated by the lack of integrated heterogeneous human-centred innovations in the transport mode decision-making process. This preliminary work presents a mobile application called ‘Green’ that exploits the current advanced state of Internet of Things technologies to track and monitor the carbon emission footprint of individuals based on their choice of transportation mode in the completion of their daily activities. To alter human behaviour and build loyalty towards a decarbonised society, the paper discusses the integration of Green within a loyalty reward programme that uses CO2 emission reduction as a currency. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

However, the textiles in developing countries continue to face issues such as severe water pollution, emissions, and increased carbon footprint, despite using various recycling techniques. To tackle these ecological issues, micro- and macro-factors must be incorporated into sustainable policies and practices. Considering this, the current empirical study aims to assess the influence of employees' green behaviour (EGB) and organisational green culture (OGC) on environmental sustainability practices (ESP) among textile small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Bangladesh. Furthermore, based on these relationships, the study examined the moderating role of green technology adoption (GTA). A conceptual model has been proposed. The quantitative methodology was employed with a self-administrated structured questionnaire, followed by a cross-sectional research design to test the model. The data were collected from employees of 140 textile SMEs in Dhaka and analysed using the structural equation modelling (SEM) technique (SmartPLS 3 software). The results revealed the primary outcome, a significant relationship between EGB and OGC with ESP. GTA played the moderating role between EGB and ESP. The study's novelty contributes to the existing literature on sustainability in an organisational setting by assessing these relationships and testing the moderation effects. Theoretically, this study contributes by applying the theory of planned behaviour and Self-determination theory to explain the constructs. Besides contributing to the literature and theories, the study also offers many empirical insights for the industry, regulatory bodies, and other stakeholders of developing countries, especially Bangladesh. The study outcomes guide the decision-makers to formulate green strategies and encourage the employees' green behaviour and commitment to the organisations in the wake of greening the textile manufacturing sector. The study also identifies the need to incorporate GTA and OGC into textile SMEs to encourage positive EGB and increase ESP.

This development of renewable energies should also be implemented in a sustainable manner and not cause additional environmental stress and related damage. In order for the ocean energy sector to consider environmental impacts at the earliest stage of concept creation, the Environmental Assessment (EA) module was developed and included in an integrative suite of design and assessment tools (namely DTOceanPlus) to support technology innovation processes. Several complementary features were developed in the EA module which provides insight into impacts at different levels. At local scale, environmental impacts are assessed in relation to the different design choices that cover various potential pressures induced by the ocean energy array. Moreover, surveys and mitigation measures are provided regarding endangered species potentially present. At global scale, a life cycle assessment is conducted to evaluate the carbon footprint of a project in terms of its contribution to global warming and the cumulative energy demand. The present paper describes the integration of EA into DTOcean+ and two case studies were used to exemplify the use and relevancy of the EA’s features to evaluate environmental impacts of a wave and a tidal ocean energy projects. Overall the EA module provides insight and support to the ocean energy sector to achieve sustainable development of marine renewable energies. © 2023, European Wave and Tidal Energy Conference.

Given this perspective, this study examines the relationship between environmental degradation and economic growth within the framework of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis in India. The growth-environment nexus using Autoregressive Distributive Lag is heterogeneous and footprint-specific. We find an inverted N-shaped EKC for cropland, N-shaped EKC for the forest, grazing, water, and built-up land footprints, and a monotonic increasing relationship for the carbon footprint. Projections based on annual per capita GDP show that cropland depletion would end by 2034 once India’s per capita GDP reaches USD 3,010. Besides, our study predicts that grazing land and forest land footprints will start increasing by 2026 and 2027, corresponding to a per capita GDP of USD 2,208 and USD 2,299. Our finding that the growth-environment relationship is time-varying and heterogeneous suggests policymakers and governments devise footprint-specific strategies to address their depletion. © 2023 Newcastle University."

This paper is one of very few to elicit preferences about mining in rural communities in a developing country, close to mines and exposed to mining externalities. Using stated preference methods, we find that to prevent the externalities from mining, the poorest individuals in our sample are willing to contribute average amounts equal to at least their average households’ weekly consumption expenditures. Our results are useful for stakeholders. First, this sector plays an essential role in the economy of many developing countries like Peru with little diversified economies. It is critical for these governments to ensure that mining activities are sustainable to avoid conflicts of many types and at various scales. Countries like Peru cannot risk missing out on the development benefits that well-governed mining can bring to them. Second, it is also urgent for mining companies to take care not only of their carbon and water footprint, but also their impacts on the environment and livelihoods in the regions where they operate, and their contribution to attain the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These issues need to be of high priority for countries that are highly dependent on mining as their trading partners implement environmental regulations. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."

Initially, waste coffee was directly converted into spherical graphene structures in the rotary furnace without applying any post-treatment. Extensive characterization indicated the formation of spherical graphene with an average particle diameter of 200 nm by flash pyrolysis with a significant increase in the C/O ratio from 8.45 to 19.78 and a high density of sp2 bondings. This upcycled graphene was assembled with functionalized graphene and graphene oxide obtained from graphite acted as counter electrodes by using glass fiber as a separator and liquid electrolyte of KOH. The supercapacitor with upcycled graphene and reduced graphene electrodes has shown high capacitance retention of 93%, and Coulombic efficiency of 99% with a higher charge transfer resistance of 58 Ω. Furthermore, a comparative life cycle assessment study was carried out to investigate the carbon footprint and ecological impact of different graphene types received from virgin and recycled sources. The process of upcycling waste coffee was much more desirable from an ecological aspect and the release of CO2 emissions to obtain sustainable supercapacitor electrodes compared to conventional graphene manufacturing techniques.

Even though hydrogen is a non-carbonaceous energy source, the pathways undertaken for its production can have harmful environmental implications. Thus, this study focuses on investigating the exergoenvironmental performances of the copper-chlorine, iron-chlorine, and magnesium-chlorine thermochemical hydrogen generation processes. This study also performs a comparative exergoenvironmental analysis of the three processes. The performances of the various processes are examined based on of the environmental impact rates of exergy destruction, component-related environmental impact rates, cumulative environmental impact rates, and exergoenvironmental factors. The global warming potentials of the thermochemical cycles are also evaluated and compared for various electricity sources to obtain hydrogen. The modeling and simulation of each process are performed using Aspen-plus by considering various heat recovery approaches for thermal management. The results suggest that the environmental impact rates of exergy destruction are relatively much higher compared to the environmental impact rates associated with the components for all processes. Furthermore, the hydrolysis step yields the highest component-associated environment impact rate for all thermochemical cycles considered (Fe–Cl: 3497 mPts/h, Cu–Cl: 1997 mPt/h, and Mg–Cl: 910 mPts/h). Moreover, the magnesium-chlorine cycle results in the highest environmental impact rate of exergy destruction (650,328 mPts/h) while the iron-chlorine cycle has the highest component-related environmental impact rate (5219 mPts/h) among the three cycles. In addition, the global warming potential of the magnesium-chlorine cycle is relatively higher compared to the copper-chlorine cycle for several electricity sources. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC"

Wind energy systems generate power with a reduction in environmental pollution as well as it improves the reliability and stability of the power system. For long-term planning and future capacity expansion and to ensure that the installed generation capacity is sufficient to meet the load demand, the evaluation of generation system reliability indices is a key factor. Hence, this paper proposed the innovative four-parameter-based progressive alpha model method (FPBPAMM) based on generalized functions analysis for improving the power system reliability with the insertion of wind energy generation. Therefore, the effect of the penetration of wind energy generation on the reliability of the power system is examined. Moreover, power system reliability enhancement using the wind energy system is calculated. Full risk analysis and case study have been performed to explain the effectiveness of the proposed technique and to provide a good understanding of the power system reliability impact consequential for the wind power system merging into the main grid. © 2024 IETE."

The absence of adequate regulations, guidelines and operational infrastructure for photovoltaic waste in the country may lead to waste being inappropriately landfilled or incinerated in a manner that may be detrimental to human health and the environment. Business as usual projection estimates 6.64 million tonnes and 5.48 million tonnes of waste generation due to the early and regular losses using the Weibull distribution function, respectively by 2040 in India. The current study also systematically investigates various policies and legislation developments on the end-of-life of photovoltaic modules in various regions of the world, to identify gaps for further assessment. Using life cycle assessment methodology, this paper compares the environmental impacts of landfilling end-of-life crystalline silicon panels with avoided burden approach due to the recycling of materials. It has been demonstrated that solar photovoltaic recycling and reusing the recovered materials will result in impact reduction in the forthcoming production phase by as high as 70%. Further, the outcomes of carbon footprint, single score indicator with the application of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change also predicts lower values for avoided burden approach due to recycling (15,393.96 kgCO2 eq) in comparison to landfill approach (19,844.054 kg CO2 eq).

Nematode trophic structure and soil properties were evaluated in pear rows (intra) maintained without weeds applying herbicide and in the inter-rows (between rows) covered with: Medicago+grasses (MG), fescue or spontaneous vegetation. Soil samples were taken at 0-20 and 20-40 cm depths from 2012 to 2014. Nematode assemblage was different in each inter-row and row, mainly in the topsoil. The inter-rows were reservoirs of omnivores-predators. The MG inter-row promoted the highest accumulation of organic carbon, total N and exchangeable K in the soil. The enrichment index was related to the quantity of dry matter produced by cover crops with the highest index observed in MG. Nematode biomass showed a positive correlation with intra and inter-rows soil organic carbon. Carbon flow through bacterivores prevailed in intra-rows, while bacterivores or herbivores canalized the inter-rows. © 2023, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo. All rights reserved."

Finding strategies to reduce CO2 output from energy systems that rely on chemical processes is one of the biggest problems in this area. In order to address this challenge, researchers are looking into creative solutions, such as carbon capture and storage and developing alternative energy systems with low carbon footprints. For this, the present work introduces a creative integration of molten carbonate and solid oxide fuel cells to maximize efficiency while reducing energy costs. This system also has a recovery unit to reuse the generated CO2 as the gasification agent for reduced environmental impact. Besides, the surplus heat is exploited through the vanadium chloride cycle for clean hydrogen production. A techno-economic, sustainability, and exergo-environmental assessment is carried out to evaluate the system's feasibility from all facets. According to the parametric results, there is a conflictive trend among performance indicators by changing the fuel utilization factor and compressor pressure ratio. Therefore, a comparative analysis of various multi-objective optimization scenarios is performed to find the best condition from various perspectives. According to the findings, compared to the system without a recovery unit, the proposed model produces optimal hydrogen of 1.3 kg/s with a very low environmental effect and power costs of 5.3 kg/GWh and 19.4 $/MWh. The results further reveal that when power is considered an additional optimization goal, it increases up to 494.95 MWh, resulting in the lowest environmental effect and the cost of 4.4 kg/GWh and 16.3 $/MWh, respectively. The scatter distribution of the key variables ultimately reveals that, while the current density should be maintained at its highest level, the optimal points of utilization factor are distributed throughout the entire domain. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC"

The broader use of combined heat and power, including high-efficiency cogeneration in particular, contributes to saving the primary energy contained in fuel and reducing the carbon footprint calculated in terms of the combined electricity and heat produced. Electricity generation in high-efficiency cogeneration units has found recognition in many European Union countries. These countries have introduced support systems to stimulate the development of these sources. Poland also has significant potential for the development of high-efficiency cogeneration. In Poland, a dedicated law promoting electricity from high-efficiency cogeneration was adopted in 2018. The law was implemented in the second half of 2019. Other schemes were also implemented in Poland, in which high-efficiency cogeneration units may participate for development purposes. The purpose of the all-new regulations is to further develop high-efficiency cogeneration, guaranteeing the possibility of building new sources or activities related to the modernisation or operation of existing sources. The article presents support systems for high-efficiency cogeneration, together with an assessment of their implementation and the impact on the development of these sources. © 2023, WSB University.

Accordingly, we developed a holistic framework to calculate a landfill’s Ecological Footprint (EF) and applied that to the Fargo, North Dakota, landfill. Parallelly, the carbon footprint and biocapacity of the landfill were calculated. We calculated the EF for six scenarios (i.e., cropland, grazing land, marine land, inland fishing ground, forest land, and built land as land types) and six operational strategies typical for landfills. Operational strategies were selected based on the variations of landfill equipment, the gas collection system, efficiency, the occurrence of fugitive emissions, and flaring. The annual EF values range from 124 to 213,717 global hectares depending on land type and operational strategy. Carbon footprints constituted 28.01-99.98% of total EF, mainly driven by fugitive emissions and landfill equipment. For example, each percent increase in Fargo landfill’s fugitive emissions caused the carbon footprint to rise by 2130 global hectares (4460 tons CO2e). While the landfill has biocapacity as grazing grass in open spaces, it remains unused/inaccessible. By leveraging the EF framework for landfills, operators can identify the primary elements contributing to a landfill’s environmental impact, thereby minimizing it. © 2023 American Chemical Society."

The care of such an aging-built environment needs a carefully planned approach that can take advantage of new technologies such as Historical/Heritage Building Information Modelling (H-BIM) and Digital Twin (DT). The final goal is to promote a long-term sustainable restoration, implying high qualitative standards. The topic of sustainability is often focused on new constructions, where it is of fundamental importance to save materials, energy, and land use, as well as decrease the carbon footprint. However, it is important to apply innovative digital management technologies to historical buildings in Italy, which are way more fragile if compared to modern ones. Cultural heritage is in general subject to specific challenges that need to be addressed, especially considering extreme events such as the earthquake that occurred in the L’Aquila Region in 2019, or in the area of Amatrice in 2016 affecting Marche and Umbria Regions. Digital technologies can be used to prevent or at least mitigate the effects of those kinds of catastrophic events, limiting damages and saving human lives, but also providing valuable information, and creating tools to be shared among stakeholders, to restore the physical and cultural value of a historical building, even in case of extreme events. © 2023, Universidad Politecnica de Valencia..

The reasons for exceeding the carbon footprint of electricity production in Ukraine relative to values in other countries are explained. It was determined that the reasons for such an excess are not only due to different levels of technical condition of power plant equipment, but also depend on calculation methods, in particular, the use of different limits of the life cycle of electricity production. Also (in the case of using natural gas) using different methods of destribution of fuel costs for the production of heat and electricity in the case of combined production of heat and electricity. Expected that the results of the work will be used in the calculations of the products carbon footprint for which uses electricity. © Butrym O.V., Panchenko G.G., 2023."

There is an opportunity to deepen the concept of literacy in ways that not only capture operational aspects of tourism and carbon, but also embrace cultural and contextual knowledge and practices, so that the host-guest relationship is mutually enriching and contributes to regenerating destinations. This conceptual paper proposes a pathway that moves beyond building domain-specific carbon literacy to growing “Green Service Literacy” and ultimately “Regenerative Literacy.” The vision of Regenerative Literacy connects to deep ecology thinking and decade-long efforts such as those proffered in the Earth Charter. Ultimately, it seeks to (re-)align our lifestyles with nature and ensure the human footprint remains within planetary boundaries. Changes across the tourism system are recommended to enable this transformation. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Despite their importance, current climate mitigation analyses often overlook these items, leaving a gap in comprehensive analyses of their material stock and environmental impacts. To address this, our research integrates input-output analysis (IOA) with dynamic material flow analysis (d-MFA) to assess the carbon and material footprints of machinery. It finds that in 2019, machinery production required 30% of global metal production and 8% of global carbon emissions. Between 2000 and 2019, the metal footprint of the stock of machinery grew twice as fast as the economy. To illustrate the global implications and scale, we spotlight key countries. China’s rise in machinery material stock is noteworthy, surpassing the United States in 2008 in total amount and achieving half of the US per capita level by 2019. Our study also contrasts economic depreciation─a value-centric metric─with the tangible lifespan of machinery, revealing how much the physical size of the capital stock exceeds its book values. As physical machinery stocks saturate, new machinery can increasingly be built from metals recycled from retired machinery. © 2023 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society."

In this context, the study investigates the validity of the pollution haven hypothesis (PHH) by comprehensively examining the effects of foreign direct investment, renewable energy, import, export, natural resources rent, and income on environmental quality. The findings of the study show that the validity of the PHH varies depending on the environmental indicators, because while the PHH is valid for the CO2 and the load capacity factor, it is not valid for the ecological footprint. Moreover, renewable energy is the only element that can increase the environmental quality. All other variables have a negative effect on the load capacity factor, which worsens the environmental quality. The results of the study suggest that the Thai government should take measures to regulate natural resources rent and foreign capital inflows by considering environmental concerns and promoting renewable resources. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."

Men and women contribute differently to climate change and have different roles in low-carbon energy transition. Gender roles influence career choices, abilities to invest in low-carbon solutions, power of decision-making, dissimilar mobility and energy consumption demands, and different values and consumption profiles, shaping the individual carbon footprint and behavior. A feminist methodology in gen-der-just low-carbon energy transformation goes beyond the introduction of certain gender-equal redistribution measures and aims to deal with the core roots of the different unequal practices in all fields of society life. It seeks to rebalance prevailing power arrangements, centering the most marginalized individuals and groups. There are various frameworks developed for the analysis of linkages between climate change and women following the feminist theory, like gender impact assessment (GIA); gender equality training (GET) model, and so on. The paper applies the feminist theory approach to the analysis of low-carbon energy transitions. The main purpose of using a feminist lens in this study is to enable the discovery of how people interact within energy systems and to offer solutions to confront and eradicate oppressive structures for just low-carbon energy transition in the EU. © 2023, University of Economics and Human Sciences in Warsaw.

However, most methodologies focus on impacts from fuel consumption, and approaches trying to integrate other transport components have not facilitated its application to actual and specific transport services. In this study, we present a harmonized approach to address the transport services with a holistic way to increase the knowledge about hotspots of the transport sector based on the life cycle assessment methodology. In this framework, vehicle manufacturing, fuel production, and infrastructure construction are the key transport components around the traffic process. Besides fuel usage, the operation and maintenance of vehicles and infrastructures are also included. We developed a tool to create the life cycle inventories for each transport component to be applied to specific transport services in any location with a comprehensive view and low uncertainty in the results. This approach was applied to road-freight services in Colombia, Malaysia, and Spain. The main results showed the nature and origin of the environmental impacts, which are highly influenced by the emissions control technologies, road characteristics, and traffic volume. The contribution of atmospheric pollutants per tonne-km can decrease by a quarter when Euro VI trucks on highways instead of conventional trucks on single-lane roads are used. However, these contributions are highly affected by fuel production due to the origin of biofuels. The proposed methodology provides relevant information to estimate transport impacts in the life cycle assessment of products with superior precision and identify strategies for systemically improving sustainability. © 2022, The Author(s)."

Corporations emit the most carbon due to inadequate supply networks. Corporate social responsibility is crucial to customer trust and global norms in modern organizations. Environment protection and carbon emission reduction rules are crucial in the UAE, which wants to be a business powerhouse. Quantitative research is cross-sectional because numbers better explain the situation. Some data was obtained for this study. A simple random sampling technique was utilized to obtain data from 90 UAE supply chain workers. Demographic descriptive information and firm carbon emission data were used. The knowledge helped respondents identify eco-friendly corporate practices. Education is essential to convincing businesses and consumers of their environmental responsibility.

Coupling a green energy source (e.g., photovoltaic, wind) with fuel cells and hydrogen storage satisfied the dynamic energy consumption and dynamic hydrogen demand for both the civilian and military mobility sectors. To make the military sector independent of its civilian counterpart, a military site was connected to a renewable energy hub. This made it possible to develop a stand-alone green-energy system, transform the military site into a positive energy hub, and achieve autonomous energy operation for several days or weeks. An environmental and economic assessment was conducted to determine the carbon footprint and the economic viability. The combined installed capacity of the solar power plant and the wind turbine was 2.5 times the combined peak consumption, with about 19% of the total electricity and 7% of the hydrogen produced still available to external consumers. © 2023 The Authors"

With different amounts of NFA (25%, 50%, 75% and 100% by weight) replaced with FRAP aggregates, the mechanical qualities of the mortar mix deteriorated. To counteract this, jarosite - a waste from the zinc industry - was used as a partial replacement for cement (replacements of 5%, 10% and 15%). The jarosite improved the microstructural, mechanical and shrinkage properties. For example, compared with the control mix (100% NFA), the mix containing 25% FRAP aggregates showed a 5.5% reduction in hardened density and a 14% reduction in compressive strength. With the addition of 10% jarosite, there was an increase of 4.85% in hardened density and 7% in compressive strength with respect to the mix containing 25% FRAP aggregates. It is thus suggested that 10% jarosite is used when FRAP aggregates are used to make cement mortar mixes. A cost analysis was also performed. The findings of this work are expected to inspire rational mix design recommendations for mortar mixes including FRAP aggregates, as well as bringing environmental and economic benefits by reducing carbon dioxide footprints.  © 2023 Emerald Publishing Limited: All rights reserved."

Governmental emission regulations are increasingly stringent, and consumers are increasingly environmentally conscious. Companies should therefore integrate carbon emissions in their supply chain decision making. In this paper, we study the inbound supply mode and inventory management decision making for a company that sells an assortment of products. Stochastic demand for each product arrives periodically and unmet demand is backlogged. Each product has two distinct supply modes that differ in terms of their carbon emissions, speed, and costs. The company needs to decide when to ship how much using which supply mode such that total holding, backlog, and procurement costs are minimized while the emissions associated with different supply modes across the assortment remains below a target level. We assume that shipment decisions for each product are governed by a dual-index policy for which we optimize the parameters. We formulate this decision problem as a mixed integer linear program that we solve through Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition. We benchmark our decision model against two state-of-the-art approaches in a large test-bed based on real-life carbon emissions data. Relative to our decision model, the first benchmark lacks the flexibility to dynamically ship products with two supply modes while the second benchmark makes supply mode decisions for each product individually. Our computational experiment shows that our decision model can outperform the first and second benchmark by up to 15 and 40 percent, respectively, for moderate carbon emission reduction targets. © 2023 The Author(s)"

A recent example of such a material is poly(butylene xylosediglyoxylate) (PBX), a xylose-based polyester made in high yield from the hemicellulosic fraction of biomass. The well-rounded performance of PBX in terms of tensile strength, glass-transition temperature, and gas permeability makes it suitable for a range of market applications. However, PBX tends to be brittle (elongation at a break of 9.8%), depending on the manufacturing process. Herein, the rational tuning of PBX’s flexibility was investigated using compounding strategies with additives and the commercially available polyesters poly(butylene succinate) and poly[(butylene adipate)-co-(butylene terephthalate)] (PBAT). While the use of additives failed to improve the flexibility of PBX, the blending approach with PBAT led to materials with improved flexibility while retaining excellent thermomechanical and barrier properties. For example, the blending of PBX with 20 wt % PBAT led to elongations of break of 148% while maintaining a 1.6 GPa tensile modulus, a main glass transition of 89 °C, and only moderately disrupted barrier properties (OTR100 μm = 18 cm3/m2/day and WVTR100 μm = 44 g/m2/day).

With a typical overall efficiency of compressed air generation, treatment and delivery, the electrical power requirement increases to over 75 kW just to operate a single YSG. Such high electrical power consumption must be addressed. One of the most effective ways to reduce the cost of compressed air generation and treatment is to replace the existing technology with one that is less energy intensive. Based on centrifugal blowers used in vacuum cleaners, a prototype was built and connected to various mixing chambers. Simulations and measurements were performed to evaluate the tension force acting on the yarn. Research on the use of vacuum for yarn suction is presented. It is estimated that after optimizing the suction by using vacuum, only 20 kW of electrical power will be required for one YSG, halving the cost of the current approach using compressed air generation. HYPOTHESIS 1: To significantly improve the efficiency of yarn suction gun (YSG), the existing technology must be significantly modified or reinvented. HYPOTHESIS 2: The application of convergent-divergent nozzles enables supersonic airflow velocities in rough vacuum. HYPOTHESIS 3: A modified YSG can be operated with a rough vacuum instead of compressed air to achieve significantly higher overall efficiency and reduce power input and carbon footprint. © 2023 The Author(s).

Until now, mainly deterministic supplier selection and lot-sizing models have been suggested. Moreover, it is not easy to make a SC sustainable solely by focusing on carbon footprint. Other sustainability factors, such as social, water, and waste management need to be considered. Therefore, the present study proposed a three-stage multiobjective, multisupplier, multiperiod joint supplier selection, and lot-sizing model, considering carbon footprint, water footprint, solid and liquid waste, and use of recycled materials in a stochastic environment. The model optimizes three objectives (cost, carbon emission, and social sustainability). The model considers different model parameters uncertain, such as costs, emission, solid waste, liquid waste, recycled material, quality rejection, and capacity. The present study suggests quantifying social sustainability and further using it in the lot-sizing model. The study has applied three stages. First, best-worst method and TOPSIS are used to assess suppliers' social scores. Second, the proposed possibilistic lot-sizing model uses the suppliers' social scores. In the third stage, the ϵ-constraint approach is used to generate tradeoff curves. The model generates optimal solutions for various levels of uncertainty, which are utilized to develop cost, emission, and social tradeoff curves. © 1988-2012 IEEE."

Ammonia (NH3) has become dominant in the international transportation and storage of low-carbon alternative fuels. NH3 is regarded as an alternative fuel, as a carbon-free fuel, and renewable hydrogen (H2) carrier with high energy density, and its production and distribution infrastructure are well established. However, a current challenge is that NH3 has a lower burning velocity and a narrow flammability limit. Thus, the use of NH3 has numerous limitations in practical combustion applications. Blending NH3 with H2 is considered a solution that has been proposed to enhance NH3 combustion by improving ignition, flammability, and H2 safety issue. Using NH3 blended with H2 as a fuel in combustion systems is a practical approach to decarbonizing the energy sector. Thus, this review highlights the existing influential studies and ongoing research on NH3/H2 blended fuels. The review covers NH3 assists the safety behaviour of H2 use, in-situ NH3 dissociation, NH3 and H2 properties, NH3/H2 combustion characterization, techniques for low NOx NH3/H2 combustion, and challenges for NH3/H2 combustion. Finally, recommendations for future studies are provided for further developing the utilization of NH3/H2 as blended fuel. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC"

In response to these initiatives, the implementation of mobility budgets offers a more precise strategy for addressing carbon footprints associated with travel. Prioritizing localized carbon footprint control, mobility budgets are calculated and customized according to distinct regions, goals, and target demographics. When prioritizing the mobility budget as the central objective in municipal transport route planning, the focus should encompass principles of fairness and equity in travel. This entails considering factors such as accessibility, variety of mobility choices, inclusivity of transportation modes, and social justice. Therefore, this article aims to formulate an enhanced activity modelling methodology that would aid data-driven decision-making in municipal transport route planning, while upholding the principles of travel fairness and equity. Тhe results obtained from scrutinizing data related to public bus services and mobile networks are presented. The evaluation of Jelgava’s city transportation network to facilitate mobility budget reduction is undertaken, and this assessment is based on an analysis of data derived from a survey on public transport use coupled with an examination of the city’s mobility budget.

Accordingly, this study aims to repurpose fish waste into valuable, nutritionally rich products and extract essential chemical compounds such as proteins and oils using a newly developed hybrid solar dryer (HSD). This proposed HSD aims to produce thermal energy for drying fish waste through the combined use of solar collectors and solar panels. The HSD, primarily composed of a solar collector, drying chamber, auxiliary heating system, solar panels, battery, pump, heating tank, control panel, and charging unit, has been designed for the effective drying of fish waste. We subjected the fish waste samples to controlled drying at three distinct temperatures: 45, 50, and 55 °C. The results indicated a reduction in moisture content from 75.2% to 24.8% within drying times of 10, 7, and 5 h, respectively, at these temperatures. Moreover, maximum drying rates of 1.10, 1.22, and 1.41 kgH2O/kg dry material/h were recorded at 45, 50, and 55 °C, respectively. Remarkable energy efficiency was also observed in the HSD’s operation, with savings of 79.2%, 75.8%, and 62.2% at each respective temperature. Notably, with an increase in drying temperature, the microbial load, crude lipid, and moisture content decreased, while the crude protein and ash content increased. The outcomes of this study indicate that the practical, solar-powered HSD can recycle fish waste, enhance its value, and reduce the carbon footprint of processing operations. This sustainable approach, underpinned by renewable energy, offers significant environmental preservation and a reduction in fossil fuel reliance for industrial operations. © 2023 by the authors."
784,Cr and CeO2 promoted Ni/SBA-15 framework for hydrogen production by steam reforming of glycerol,Article,Abrokwah R.Y.; Ntow E.B.; Jennings T.; Stevens-Boyd R.; Hossain T.; Swain J.; Bepari S.; Hassan S.; Mohammad N.; Kuila D.,Environmental science and pollution research international,30.0,2023,120945,120962,10.1007/s11356-023-30748-6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85179008797&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-023-30748-6&partnerID=40&md5=f09af9e5c520d216ee4827e994932851,16147499,Scopus,Catalyst stability; CeO2; Chromium; GSR; Hydrogen energy; Mesoporous silica; Nickel Catalysts; SBA-15,"Ni/SBA-15 meso-structured catalysts modified with chromium and CeO2 (Ni-Cr-CeO2/SBA-15) were utilized to produce hydrogen from glycerol steam reforming (GSR). The catalysts were synthesized by a one-pot hydrothermal process and extensively characterized by analytical techniques such as N2 adsorption-desorption (BET), H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The low-angle XRD reflections affirmed that the catalysts were crystalline and possessed a 2D-ordered porosity. The BET results depicted that all the catalysts exhibited a good surface area ranging from 633 to 792m2/g, and the pore sizes were consistently in the mesoporous range (between 3 and 5 nm). TEM analysis of both calcined and spent catalysts revealed that the metal active sites were embedded in the hybrid CeO2-SiO2 support. Overall, the Ni-based catalysts exhibited higher glycerol conversion -12Ni-SBA-15-99.9%, 12Ni3CeO2-SBA-15-89.4%, and 8Ni4Cr3CeO2-SBA-15-99.7%. Monometallic 12Ni/SBA-15 performed exceptionally well, while 12Cr/SBA-15 performed poorly with the highest 71.48% CO selectivity. For short-term GSR reactions, CeO2 addition to 12Ni/SBA-15 did not have any effect, whereas Cr addition resulted in a 32% decrease in H2 selectivity. The long-term stability studies of 12Ni-SBA-15 showed H2 selectivity of ~ 64% and ~ 98% glycerol conversion. However, its activity was short-lived. After 20-30 h, the H2 selectivity and conversion dropped precipitously to 40%. The doping of mesoporous Ni/SBA-15 with Cr and CeO2 remarkably enhanced the long-term stability of the catalyst for 12Ni3CeO2-SBA-15, and 8Ni4Cr3CeO2-SBA-15 catalyst which showed ~ 58% H2 selectivity and ~ 100% conversion for the entire 60 h. Interestingly, Cr and CeO2 seem to improve the shelf-life of Ni-SBA-15 via different mechanistic pathways. CeO2 mitigated Ni poisoning through coke oxidation whereas Cr bolstered the catalyst stability via maintaining a well-defined pore size, structural rigidity, and integrity of the heterogeneous framework, thereby restricting structural collapse, and hence retard sintering of the Ni active sites during the long-term 60 h of continuous reaction. Hydrogen generation from renewable biomass like glycerol could potentially serve as a sustainable energy source and could substantially help reduce the carbon footprint of the environment. © 2023.

We used as case study a medium-sized Greek landfill, and we initially investigated the performance of the existing secondary leachate treatment system. The activated sludge process removed chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), NH4-N, and PO4-P by 55%, 84%, 94%, and 14%, respectively, but the effluents did not meet the legislation requirements for discharge or reuse. Afterwards, different management options of these effluents (co-treatment with sewage in the centralized treatment plant, onsite tertiary treatment with reverse osmosis, granular activated carbon (GAC), ozonation, photo-Fenton, or constructed wetlands) were evaluated regarding their operational costs and environmental footprint. The use of constructed wetlands presented the lower operational cost, energy requirements, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, not exceeding 21.5 kg CO2eq/day. On the other hand, the power consumption and the GHG emissions of the other on-site technologies ranged from 0.37 kWh/m3 and 5.56 kg CO2eq/day (use of GAC) to 39.19 kWh/m3 and 588.6 kg CO2eq/day (use of ozonation), respectively. The co-treatment of the leachates with municipal wastewater required 0.6 kWh/m3 and emitted 30.18 kg CO2eq/day. For achieving zero-discharge of the treated leachates, a system consisting of constructed wetlands and evaporation ponds in series was designed. © 2023. The Author(s)."

Employing a top-down measurement approach, this paper assesses the carbon footprint of Bitcoin mining in China from 2017 to 2021. The findings reveal that mining activities during this period contributed to a total of 77.84 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions in China. By utilizing data at the provincial level, we find that the seasonal migration of Bitcoin mining pools will lead to regional power demand shocks in China. Additionally, this study predicts future carbon emissions from Bitcoin mining in China, projecting cumulative carbon dioxide emissions of 76.40 million tons and 722.18 million tons by 2030 and 2060 respectively, in the absence of any policy interventions. Based on these findings, this paper posits that governments worldwide should make efforts to restrict the carbon emissions from Bitcoin mining and opt for environmentally friendly technological methods to fundamentally alleviate Bitcoin's reliance on energy. The implication for central banks is that carbon emission should be taken into consideration when designing the central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). © 2023 The Authors"

This study proposed a new multi-indicator evaluation framework for regional water sustainability under local energy transition to quantitatively evaluate the water withdrawal and water environment during the energy transition from a lifecycle perspective. An integrated regional energy‒water evaluation model was also developed based on the Low Emissions Analysis Platform with a combination of lifecycle assessment and water footprint analysis. Shaanxi province in China was then taken as a case study, and the impacts of its energy transition on regional water environmental sustainability, including quantity and quality, were investigated under five scenarios. Results showed that the large-scale application of carbon capture, utilisation and storage technology and bio-energy equipped with carbon capture and storage technology could have additional advantages regarding CO2 emissions. However, such technologies exhibit a minimal effect on improving water environmental quality and reducing water demand for the first time due to the leakage of absorbents, CO2 and other risky substances during capture, transportation and storage from a lifecycle perspective. This finding drives the innovation of related breakthrough technologies with the promotion of water and end-treatment technologies in the future. © 2024 The Authors"

Using the comprehensive evaluation index of AI constructed by the entropy method and the dataset at the global national level, we find that from 2010 to 2019, the overall level of global AI shows an upward trend, in which the growth rate of AI in developed countries is more pronounced and exhibits a stable growth trend, while the growth rate of AI in developing countries displays a trend of instability. The research results show that AI has a significant inhibitory effect on ecological footprints. This conclusion holds even after endogeneity and robustness tests. In addition, under the effect of globalization, the impact of AI on ecological footprints shows nonlinear characteristics. As globalization deepens, the marginal effect of AI in reducing the ecological footprint shows an increasing trend. These findings emphasize the important role of AI in environmental governance and provide a new and comprehensive perspective for policymakers. Therefore, the government should continue to support the research and application of AI, promote the cross-industry integration of AI, and play a positive role in the process of globalization to promote global sustainable development. © 2023.

In the context of the BRICS nations-Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa-this study explores the intricate interactions between institutional entrepreneurship, institutional innovation, poverty reduction, social globalization, urbanization, and social entrepreneurship as well as their combined effects on the carbon footprint over the period of 1990 to 2021. This work examines the multi-dimensional interactions inside this nexus using a thorough analytical strategy that includes the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), Three-Stage Least Squares (3SLS), and Robust regression approaches. Institutional entrepreneurship and innovation are the main forces behind institutional change and may have an impact on how people behave in terms of the environment. Strategies for reducing poverty frequently involve greater resource usage, which has an impact on carbon footprint. Examining social globalization's impact on carbon footprints is necessary given how it affects consumer habits and economic activity. Rapid urbanization is a dual problem because it spurs both increased energy demand and novel sustainability measures. With its emphasis on community-driven solutions, social entrepreneurship can provide regional solutions to reduce poverty and carbon emissions. The study's findings provide policymakers, practitioners, and researchers with insights into the complex web of socio-economic factors that underlies carbon footprint fluctuations. This research paves the way for informed policy decisions, sustainable business practices, and the pursuit of harmonious development that addresses both economic aspirations and environmental imperatives within the BRICS countries by illuminating the connections between institutional entrepreneurship, innovation, poverty reduction, social globalization, urbanization, social entrepreneurship, and carbon emissions. © 2023.

Moreover, the study also tests the existence of the N-shaped Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis for North African countries between 1995 and 2018. These factors were analyzed using the Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS), Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS), and Pooled Mean Group (PMG) estimators to obtain estimations of heterogeneous parameters. The outcome of these tests and examinations showed that the N-shaped curve was confirmed. Secondly, The results of the study also demonstrate the effectiveness of renewable energy as an eco-friendly innovation in reducing carbon emissions. This finding highlights the positive impact that renewable energy sources can have in terms of emitting fewer carbon emissions compared to traditional energy sources. Moreover, public investment, which interprets government expenditure, and urbanization contribute to environmental degradation by increasing CO2 emissions in the case of North African countries. Furthermore, the findings also indicated a trade-off effect resulting from the correlation between CO2 emissions and economic development. Based on these findings, the study recommends that economic policymakers in North African countries prioritize transforming the structure of government expenditures to improve environmental quality, optimize the utilization of revenues from non-environmentally friendly energy resources to accelerate the energy transition, increase the exploitation of renewable energy, and promote environmental awareness in society. By implementing these recommendations, North African countries can balance economic growth and environmental quality while reducing their carbon footprint. © 2023.

The topic’s relevance is provided by global warming and the need to identify sources of direct and indirect anthropogenic impact on the carbon balance, as well as the need to assess the contribution of carbon emissions to the atmosphere of urban areas. The litter, despite its small contribution to the total carbon stock of the ecosystem, is the most mobile horizon, connecting vegetation and mineral soil horizons; thus, its typology and properties are the most important characteristics that can be used to monitor urban ecosystems. It has been shown that there is an increase in the biological cycle intensity in urban ecosystems compared to the natural analogs, which is associated with the following factors: a shift in the ratio of tree species in the city’s green frame towards a significant increase in the proportion of deciduous trees, the use of a greenery maintenance system, and the destructive impact of recreation on litter. The percentage decrease in the amount of carbon in the litter of coniferous plantations as a result of recreational impact is 20–57%, in the case of the leaf litter collection, up to 90%, while the loss of carbon reserves in absolute terms is comparable and equal to 20–23 kg/100 m2 (we note that that the litter variant of larch plantations shows the absolute values of carbon losses 3 times higher). All studied variants of urban greenery subject to pronounced anthropogenic impact and demonstrate a decrease in the biological cycle isolation compared to undisturbed ones. A change in the organic matter circulation direction in urban ecosystems towards its deposition as a part of terrestrial detritus can be implemented both by regulating the intensity of the greenery maintenance, and by reducing its loss during recreation; design solutions for the organisation of landscape objects with the diversion of visitors’ transit flows from the locations of conifers ecosystems. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd. 2023.

This is referred to as an organization's carbon footprint, and there is increasing stakeholder and regulatory pressure on management teams globally to reduce them. On other words, it is increasingly critical that the quantity of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that a company is releasing into the atmosphere can be accurately measured in order to ensure that is being reduced accordingly. The European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) is the most crucial tool for decarbonizing Europe, but it has also become a money-making machine. States and financial investors earn; for the power industry, which pays for it, the worst thing is not the system's presence but its instability. Huge price jumps make it impossible to plan budgets and investments sensibly. This paper provides an introduction to the EU's Emissions Trading System. As such it provides a discussion of the historical and legal context in which the EU ETS developed and now operates.

Different sensitivity analyses for LCA were carried out to point out which of the tested methods gave the most reliable LCA results. The main factor that helped to find the best-fitted method was CO2 emissions. The LCA analyses were performed by IOŚ-PIB using SimaPro software based on the technology data obtained during the Urbanrec project. The sensitivity analysis was conducted twofold: the LCA analysis was carried out for different time horizons in the frame of the ReCiPe method egalitarian (E), individual (I), and hierarchic (H). In the second step, the LCA results for the ReCiPe method were compared with the LCA results for methods: CML-IA, Impact 2002+, and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GGP). The results of the LCA for all endpoints are sensitive to changes in the time horizon, which is reflected in the change in impact assessment methods used in calculations. The biggest differences are visible between the egalitarian and individual perspectives. In the second case of the sensitivity analysis, differences in results between the individual analytical methods used for LCAs can be observed. The obtained results show a high sensitivity of LCA results from the adopted time horizon, as well as moderate sensitivity of the carbon footprint depending on the method of analysis used. © 2023 Izabela Samson-Brȩk et al., published by Sciendo."

To achieve this aim, the study uses the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach and Fourier Toda-Yamamoto causality test. The research findings demonstrate that an increase in transportation energy consumption, renewable energy, and globalization is associated with a reduction in environmental pollution. On the contrary, GDP and trade contribute to worsening the environment. Moreover, there exists a unidirectional causal relationship from transportation energy consumption, GDP, renewable energy, trade, and globalization towards the ecological footprint. The findings of the study recommend that the policymakers should implement strategies and provide incentives to increase the deployment of renewables in the transportation sector, specifically focusing on electric vehicles (EVs) and the necessary charging infrastructure.

797,Carbon footprint based on lifetime productivity for future cows selected for resilience to climate-related disturbances,Article,Zira S.; Bouquet A.; Rydhmer L.; Kargo M.; Puillet L.,Journal of Dairy Science,106.0,2023,8953,8968,10.3168/jds.2023-23492,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85180403132&doi=10.3168%2fjds.2023-23492&partnerID=40&md5=539856b266693a15e74ce88346604cd2,00220302,Scopus,body reserves; breeding goal; dairy cows; drought; simulation,"Droughts, which can affect feed production, are projected to become more common under future climate conditions. In light of this, breeding cattle resilient to changes in feeding regimens is increasingly becoming an important topic. Body reserves can play a crucial role when feed resources are limited. We simulated populations of dairy cows selected with 2 different breeding goals: one reflecting the current breeding goal and the other placing weight on minimum level of body reserves in early lactation and change in body reserves during lactation. We considered this latter as a breeding goal for resilience. We used the 2 dynamic simulation programs ADAM and AQAL to predict performance of the cows after selection. In AQAL, we modeled moderate and severe drought by decreasing feed quality and quantity offered to cows during one year. We compared cows selected with the 2 breeding goals under 3 environments: without disturbances related to climate and with moderate and severe drought. In the environments without disturbances and the moderate drought, the cows selected with the current breeding goal had higher lifetime lactation efficiency (energy invested in milk/energy acquired from feed) and lower carbon footprint per kilogram of protein in milk and meat than cows selected for resilience. However, with severe drought, cows selected for resilience had higher lifetime lactation efficiency and lower carbon footprint per kilogram of protein in milk and meat than those selected with the current breeding goal. This suggests that cows selected for high productive performance do not perform well under very limiting conditions, leading to increased climate impact. The importance of inclusion of body reserves as a resilience trait in dairy cattle breeding depends on the future environment in which the cows will be used. © 2023 American Dairy Science Association"

Total life cycle greenhouse gas emissions (LC-GHGs) from rice production to consumption might provide precise CFs for RPSs. Therefore, we assessed three segments (pre-farm, on-farm, and post-farm) of LC-GHGs under five major contrasting RPSs, i.e., aerobic rice (AR), shallow lowland rice (SLR), system of rice intensification (SRI), deep water rice (DWR), and zero-tilled direct-seeded rice (ZTR), in India to determine the corresponding CFs. Carbon footprint was the lowest for ZTR, while LC-GHGs were the lowest for AR. Therefore, AR is an adequate option for short-term reduction of GHG emissions. However, ZTR might be promoted by incentives as a long-term strategy. Among segmental LC-GHGs, on-farm GHG emissions contributed less than the other two segmental GHG emissions. The post-farm (i.e., farm gate to consumption) segment contributed the largest proportion (54%–69%) of total LC-GHGs, followed by pre-farm (i.e., cradle to farm) segment (21%–27%) and on-farm operation (11%–23%). These findings suggest that post-farm components that contribute to maximum GHG emissions must be scientifically tackled with proactive policy initiatives. However, the data of this segment are limited and scattered. Therefore, real-time assessment of GHG emissions during post-farm operation and input transportation from cradle to farm requires more precise quantification. Although CF in SRI was higher, this system had the potential to achieve higher yields and better soil carbon storage. Therefore, SRI may be encouraged from the perspectives of food security and long-term sustainability by reducing GHG emissions by three to four times. © 2023 Soil Science Society of China"

These smallholder dairy farms are often considered to emit substantial greenhouse gases (GHG) but are poor in productive performances. Therefore, it is crucial to estimate the carbon footprint (CF) of milk production of the smallholder Indian dairy farms. The primary objectives of the study were (1) Assessing the CF of milk production of smallholder dairy farms through life cycle analysis in south-interior Karnataka, India; (2) Identifying the hotspots of GHG emissions and significant factors influencing the CF of milk production in smallholder dairy production system. The study accounted GHG emissions from different sources and considered multiple functions of the smallholder production system. Estimations were made based on primary data collected from 47 farms and associated secondary data. For estimating the CF of milk production, the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) on a CO2-equivalent (CO2-eq) basis from feed production, enteric fermentation, manure management, transport and energy usage were allocated to fat- and protein-corrected milk (FPCM) based on mass balance, price (crop byproducts and residues) and feed digestibility. Principal component analysis and stepwise linear regression analysis were performed to identify the major factors influencing the CF. The average total GHG emissions (kg CO2-eq yr−1 farm−1) attributable to milk production based on mass, economic, and digestibility allocations were 8,936, 8,641, and 8,759, respectively. The contributions of CH4, N2O, and CO2 to the total farm GHG emission were 70.6%, 20.5%, and 7.69%, respectively. The major emission hotspots were CH4 emission from enteric fermentation (66.8%) and GHG emission from feed production (23.0%). The average CF of cradle-to-dairy cooperative milk production varied from 1.45 to 1.81 kg CO2-eq kg FPCM−1. The CF of milk production was more than 2-fold greater, when milk yield was below 3,500 kg lactating cow−1 yr−1. The FPCM yield 100 kg body weight−1, dry matter intake, and CH4 emission from manure management were the strongest determinants of the CF and explained 83.4% of the observed variation. The study emphasized the importance of considering multiple functions of a mixed crop-livestock-based dairy production system for estimating CF per unit of product. The results suggest that maintaining high-yielding dairy animals and adopting appropriate feeding strategies for better feed utilization are the possible effective interventions for reducing the CF of milk production. © 2023 American Dairy Science Association"

The study focuses on measuring the impact of Carbon Pricing Mechanism on financial flows toward sustainable projects. To meet the research objectives, the first questionnaire was developed by conducting the factor analysis of the variables framed after a review of the literature, and then PLS-SEM was applied to a sample size of 363. On running the analysis of SMART-PLS 4, it was found that there is a strong relation between dependent and independent variables but a weak relation of moderation. The analysis covered in this research has important consequences for efficient corporate management. It offers a strategic plan for making well-informed decisions, which is the foundation of effective management. From a managerial perspective, the findings underscore the critical significance of policy interventions, specifically carbon pricing mechanisms, in shaping the flow of financial resources towards sustainability initiatives.

In this context, actions taken within the energy sector are paramount in the global effort to combat climate change. This study aims to investigate the impacts of renewable and non-renewable energy consumption, energy technology investment, and green technological innovation on environmental sustainability in the context of EKC and LCC hypotheses in the USA from 1980 to 2015. While many studies in the literature focus on the EKC hypothesis, this study offers a comparative analysis of the EKC and LCC hypotheses with relevant variables. For this aim, the study uses the novel Fourier estimation methods. According to the results, the EKC and the LCC hypotheses are valid in the USA. Moreover, non-renewable energy consumption increases the ecological footprint. On the other hand, non-renewable energy consumption decreases the load capacity factor while renewable energy consumption increases it. Finally, energy technology investment and green technological innovation have an insignificant impact on the ecological footprint and the load capacity factor in both models. All results except energy technology investment and green technological innovation are consistent with our expectations. The USA has the potential to realize green growth.

Environmental impact assess-ments were performed through energy, carbon footprint, and water scarcity footprint analysis. For economic analysis, gross and net returns and benefit–cost ratios were calculated. Eco-efficiency was measured by the ratio between the net return and environmental criteria. The findings indicate that the transition from rainfed to irrigated maize cultivation per unit of land results in a 53.7% higher yield and gross value of production, but also a 69.8% increase in energy input, a 22% rise in greenhouse gas emissions, and a 3.6-fold increase in the water scarcity footprint. While a positive link exists in irrigated maize between higher yield and lower carbon footprint per unit of product, rainfed systems outperform in energy efficiency, productivity, profitability, water scarcity footprint, and overall eco-efficiency. Both systems rely heavily on nonrenewable energy sources, with fertilization (affecting energy and carbon footprint), mechanization (affecting carbon foot-print), and irrigation (exacerbating water scarcity) as the main contributors to the negative environmental impacts. The implementation of optimization strategies for these inputs is of paramount importance to reduce environmental impacts and promote sustainability in maize farming in Bosnia and Herzegovina. © 2023 The Authors."

This involves considering the effects of clinical trials on the environment and the populations engaged in the studies. The pharmaceutical sector, particularly clinical research, is a large contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. The need for a legal framework considering the environmental impact of hundreds of global clinical trials cannot be overstated. Clinical trials' carbon footprint is a complex subject that calls for cooperation from various parties, including researchers, trial sponsors, healthcare providers, and regulatory organizations. The waste generated during clinical trials, including packaging materials, laboratory supplies, and hazardous waste from the disposal of clinical samples, can adversely affect public health and the environment. Therefore, addressing this issue is essential to ensure that clinical trials are conducted in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. The purpose of this study is to discuss potential strategies to cut down on carbon emissions, discuss the challenges in setting up clinical trials in an environmentally sustainable way, and highlight the importance of a precautionary approach during the various phases of conducting clinical trials. Although there is limited research on greenhouse gas emissions generated by clinical trials, it is evident that more work needs to be done in this field. © 2023 Technoscience Publications.

Cigarette factories are a key link in the tobacco industry's production chain, and using data provided by a cigarette factory in China we conduct a life cycle assessment to account for the carbon footprint of cigar production in cigarette factories. The results of the assessment show that factory air conditioning is the most important contributor to the environmental load of the cigar manufacturing process, while electricity is the key factor that contributes the greatest environmental load across all of the processes in the product life cycle. In addition, packaging, including small boxes and cigarette cartons, have a significant impact on the industry's environmental footprint due to its use of raw materials.

To evaluate this dynamic nexus between the mentioned environmental pollution drivers of ecological footprint, this study employed the augumented mean group (AMG) and common correlated effect mean group (CCEMG) regression estimators after detection of cross-sectional dependency. The empirical outcomes denote that economic growth and transportation sector of BIMSTEC countries increase the levels of ecological footprint. Conversely, tourism sector development, globalization, and renewable energy protect the ecological excellence in the region. Moreover, it is observed that a unidirectional causality exists from economic growth to ecological footprint, ecological footprint to transportation, tourism to ecological footprint, and globalization to ecological footprint, while bidirectional causality exists between renewable energy and ecological footprint. By observing the positive function of tourism, green energy, and globalization on sustainable environment progress, central authorities are capable to redesign policies concerning supportable efficient technologies and regulate globalization towards green programs and agenda to reduce global warming. © 2023.

Therefore, this study examines the effects of disaggregated energy consumption, industrialization, and total population on the ecological footprint of the world's top 10 most populous countries namely Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Russia, and the USA, using data for the period of 1990-2020. The research employs Kao and Pedroni techniques of cointegration to determine whether the variables are cointegrated in the long run. The long-term equilibrium association is measured utilizing panel autoregressive distributed lag/pooled mean group (ARDL/PMG), and method of moment quantile (MMQ) regression methods. Furthermore, to test for the causal relationships between the selected variables, we used the Dumitrescu and Hurlin (D-H) panel causality method. The findings of the study reveal that renewable energy consumption, as well as GDP square, have a significant negative influence on ecological footprint, implying that renewable energy and GDP square reduce ecological footprint and thus enhance environmental quality. Furthermore, non-renewable energy, industrialization, total population, and GDP have a detrimental impact on environmental quality by increasing ecological footprint. It is also found that there is a one-way causality from non-renewable energy and industrialization to ecological footprint and a bidirectional causal relationship between ecological footprint and total population, GDP, and GDP2. Important policy implications are drawn based on the findings. © 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

This concept also appears more and more often in modern cities, whose authorities strive to improve the quality of life of their inhabitants, among others by creating SUMP-Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan. This is followed by all kinds of facilities that generate big traffic in cities. One of the institutions willing to meet the challenges of the ever-growing number of trips in its vicinity is Gdynia Maritime University (GMU), which is one of the largest employers in this seaport city, and thus – is one of the biggest traffic generators. The objective of this paper is to investigate the prerequisites and perspectives of creating and implementing mobility plan for GMU in order to make transport more sustainable in its vicinity. For this purpose, pilot research survey has been carried out among employees and students regarding their behaviour and transport preferences in reaching this destination. The research hypothesis stating that the transport habits of the GMU commuters are not compatible with the concept of sustainable mobility was confirmed. The implementation of a sustainable mobility plan in this institution will help to change the standards of traveling in the area of the University and will contribute to better quality of life in the city. It is recommended to enhance the cooperation with the Gdynia City Hall in order to create a synergy effect and bring an added value to sustainable development of this congested seaport urban space. © 2023, Faculty of Navigation, Gdynia Maritime University.

NASA Goddard’s Scanning L-band Active Passive (SLAP) sensor—an airborne simulator of the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite—made nine soil moisture flights near Lleida, Spain, during 15–29 July. Soil moisture imagery and histograms demonstrate sensitivity to spatial and temporal patterns spanning irrigated and non-irrigated areas and their response to both irrigation and precipitation events followed by drydowns. Comparisons with point-scale ground truth at two sites—one within the irrigated zone and one in the non-irrigated zone—are good. Soil moisture differences are within the error bars of the ground truth values and within one standard deviation of the SLAP moisture values except for the afternoon flight of July 24. The overly dry retrieved values of that flight were likely the result of the extremely dry surface conditions and the simplified uniform ancillary data values used for this analysis. Future analyses using higher-fidelity ancillary data will explore these differences. © 2023, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply."

The current study experimentally investigated hydrogen reduction of bauxite residue-CaO sintered and self-hardened pellets at 1000 °C, along with magnetic separation of these reduced pellets for iron recovery. Calcium was introduced to bauxite residue to form leachable calcium aluminate phases with the existing alumina in bauxite residue. This involved the addition of either CaCO3 or a mixture of CaO and CaCO3 while maintaining the fixed Ca content during pelletization. The former underwent sintering at 1150 °C, while the latter was self-hardened through the cementing effect of CaO in exposure to moisture and air. Both types of pellets were reduced in a thermogravimetry furnace at an elevated temperature under similar conditions. The pellets were characterized by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) method and scanning electron microscope (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and their physical and mechanical properties were measured via standard techniques. During hydrogen reduction, a negligible amount of gehlenite (Ca2Al2SiO7) was formed in the self-hardened pellets, while this phase dominated in the sintered pellets. Alumina in the bauxite residue converted to mayenite phases during reduction in both the pellet types; however, reduced self-hardened pellets had a higher amount of alumina containing mayenite leachable phase. The two pellets showed similar reduction behaviour, while different chemical, physical, and mechanical properties were observed. The magnetic properties of milled reduced pellets were examined through a Davis Tube magnetic separator in a wet environment under a constant magnetic field of 800 G. Higher iron recovery was observed for the self-hardened reduced (41%) pellets than for the sintered pellets (27%). © 2023, The Author(s)."

Removing SF6 helps to reduce the carbon footprint of the switchgear but it usually deteriorates the other impacted categories. This work compares the impact of two 145 kV GIS: one based on SF6 and one with a C4-FN-based mixture as insulating and arc-extinguishing media. Using a C4-FN mixture, the footprint of the equipment is mostly reduced to manufacturing emissions and electricity consumption in service. The limitation of the mass increase appears to be key to minimize all environmental impacts, including the effect on climate change. Some parameters of the assessment are also discussed to highlight the variability of the results depending on the user’s requirements, even for a given layout, e.g., due to the low-voltage and instrument transformer specification. The use of recycled or recyclable material is also distinguished. Both are very important, however, only the first one really reduces the carbon footprint of the solution. The evolution in the coming decades of the electricity generation mix is also discussed and cannot be considered in the calculation.

It is concluded that the existing or planned implementation of state regulation in the field of NCS is clearly insufficient to unlock the potential of NCS in Russia as a possible leader in a promising new market in the coming decades. Realizing this potential requires significant targeted work to adjust the regulation and reprioritization of forest management—from extracting wood from forests for processing to integrated forest management, including quantification and monetization of forest carbon sequestration ecosystem services. The target for increasing greenhouse gas removals in the area of land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) presented in the Long-term Low Emissions and Development Strategies until 2050 (LT LEDS) was analyzed for its achievability based on the activity and projects presented in Section 3 of the LT LEDS Operational Plan (OP) (first version). It is concluded that the draft LT LEDS operational plan in terms of ecosystem solutions raises a lot of questions due to its poor compliance with modern ideas about ecosystem adaptation and mitigation, the use of NCS, etc. This part of the LT LEDS OP requires significant revision and adaptation to modern requirements. It will also require significant revision of the currently implemented federal project “Preservation of Forests” and the state program “Development of Forestry” for their integration into the LT LEDS. The first step along this path could be calculation of the carbon footprint and carbon additionality of ongoing forestry activity in relation to the baseline scenario and the correction of forest restoration activity. © 2023, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

Taking into account the state and prospects for development of external markets for carbon units from NBOP (voluntary carbon markets, national carbon markets, implementation of projects under Articles 6.2 and 6.4 of the Paris Agreement), the conditions for successful entry of carbon units from Russian NBOP to the global market are determined. The key limitations for the domestic market of carbon units from Russian NBOP are presented: the lack of internal economic incentives for companies to acquire carbon credits and invest in Russian NBOP, the lack of national methodologies for implementation of NBOP, legal restrictions, the lack of available tools for assessing the potential of territories for implementing NBOP, and the lack of carbon market regulations based on a case study of the Sakhalin experiment. The limitations of the departmental approach to developing the NBOP sector are shown, which leads to uncoordinated and inconsistent decisions that do not correspond to real conditions in global markets. To remove these restrictions, it is necessary to create a center of competences for the entire range of issues related to implementing NBOP: from specific methodologies for individual projects to scientifically based assessments of their potential at the Russian level. Two scenarios for using NBOP for decarbonization of the Russian economy are considered: (1) predominantly the sale of Russian NBOP carbon units in foreign markets with maximized export earnings in the medium term; (2) development of the NBOP sector primarily for the domestic market to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. A realistic and balanced strategy presupposes that export-oriented Russian companies should become the key buyers of carbon units from Russian NBOP at the first stage, which can then use these units to reduce the carbon footprint of their output and implement corporate climate strategies. © 2023, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

However, a comprehensive understanding of the integrated life cycle environmental-economic performance of waste management activities remains unclear. To facilitate a systematic linkage between the economic and environmental sectors, a regionalized life cycle assessment-based life cycle costing method was developed based on China's actual status quo. The cow manure utilization was set as an entry point to explored long-term environmental-economic performance of milk production under various manure utilization pathways. The results show that trade-offs were observed between internal and external costs as well as various environmental indicators. The choice of waste utilization is the focal point of environmental-economic trade-offs in the cow raising system. The optimal environmental-economic performance was achieved through the manure fertilizer utilization pathway, yielding a remarkable three-fold increase in marginal environmental benefits. Compared with fertilizer utilization, the manure direct returning to field reduced the carbon footprint by 12% while induced an external cost of $14.3. The wastewater treatment pathway is $ 5.5 lower in internal costs but $ 11.7 higher in external costs than those of fertilizer utilization. Overall, utilizing manure has potential to mitigate the upward trend of carbon footprint and external costs. However, achieving the carbon peak remains a significant challenge. A promising solution is the recycling of straw resources within cropping systems, particularly in hotspot regions (e.g., Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Hebei, and Shandong). A comprehensive analysis of the dynamic interplay between cropping systems and cow raising systems is critical steps towards realizing a carbon-neutral future within the dairy production. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

This study analyses maize cultivation with an emerging organic fertilisation management technique, i.e., pre-seeding injection, followed by side-dressing fertigation, through a life cycle assessment approach at the farm gate with the aim of evaluating its influence on crop production as a whole, with a focus on nitrogen emissions during field application. This was done on two sample farms, one of which was fertigated using drip irrigation and the other by pivot irrigation. Each farm was then compared with a reference scenario in which traditional organic fertilisation and irrigation were used. The inventory data consist of measurements made during field trials, data collected from questionnaires to farmers and modelling estimates. The optimised management of the digestate led to important reductions in the impacts affected by ammonia emissions; acidification was reduced by 68% and 80%. Relevant mitigations were achieved for eutrophication and particulate matter formation and for the carbon footprint (12–14%). A trade-off was identified in the increased impact on the consumption of fossil and mineral resources (13–17%) due to the construction and operation of a vibrating screen operating the filtration of the liquid fraction of digestate. In conclusion, the results indicate the general benefits of improved organic fertilisation management as a whole. Future efforts should be aimed at energy and construction efficiency measures of digestate treatments. © 2023 The Author(s)"

Unfortunately, this issue is not receiving adequate attention at present. Moreover, existing methods for analyzing carbon footprints in remanufacturing systems are inefficient and inaccurate due to the complex relationship between carbon emissions and the dynamic nature of the systems. In this paper, we propose a multisource data-driven approach for carbon footprint analysis of remanufacturing systems. First, we examine the relationship between carbon emissions and the uncertainty surrounding end-of-life (EOL) product components, as well as the corresponding resource recovery strategies, such as reuse, recycle, and remanufacture. This analysis allows us to define the carbon footprint boundary of remanufacturing systems. Next, we establish a carbon footprint model for recycling strategies using recycling data. Additionally, we propose a carbon footprint model for remanufacture strategies by utilizing the back propagation neural network based on particle swarm optimization algorithm and data from the materials flow, energy flow, and waste flow of these strategies. By combining these models, we can accurately calculate the carbon footprint of remanufacturing systems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present a case study on the remanufacturing of an EOL automobile engine. This case study showcases how our methodology can be utilized as a valuable tool for analyzing carbon footprints and identifying strategies to reduce carbon emissions in remanufacturing systems. © 2023 The Authors.

Even if these devastating consequences for human health could be suppressed, hydrocarbons, alkaline agents, heavy metals, ethanolamine, formaldehyde, and N-nitrosodiethanolamine are some related elements to interfere in the ecosystem and generation of the greenhouse effect when disposed of incorrectly. Additionally, several other chemical elements are responsible for pollution and act as antifoams, anticorrosive, detergents, emulsifiers, surfactants, and biocides, the latter responsible for extinguishing the interaction of fungi and bacteria in cutting fluids and considered one of the main harmful agents to human health. Although there are numerous indications of the harmfulness of cutting fluids, two factors are essential for their use: reducing friction and avoiding adhesion or clogging between the tool-workpiece by using oil-based fluids; and the reduction of temperature, when necessary, the use of higher cutting speeds, in which cooling is a factor of greater relevance, using water-based fluids for this purpose, which, although not entirely mineral oil, not even for this can be characterized as less harmful to the biosphere. An adequate cutting fluid must arrive at the cutting interface and react quickly with the chip to form a solid with low shear strength. Therefore, cutting fluids are essential in manufacturing processes that generate a high amount of heat, such as grinding, and the use of harmful elements is characteristic of the process. To mitigate the environmental impacts caused by the conventional application, the MQL has been the most promising alternative due to the nature of its operation, not requiring fluids with a high density of chemical elements since its application is unique and atomized. However, even though MQL reduces the amount of cutting fluid in the process, in various conditions, it does not ensure the quality of the workpiece. Auxiliary techniques, such as the wheel cleaning jet, direct a jet of compressed air in the opposite direction to the cutting surface of the grinding wheel, helping to remove the clogging and making the application of MQL feasible. Therefore, this study analyzed the influence of different cutting fluid application techniques on the advanced ceramic grinding process (Al2O3) using four different wheel-cleaning jet angles combined with three different feed rates. To study the phenomena of this new technique, surface roughness, roundness error, diametral wheel wear, G-ratio, grinding power, grinding cost analyses, and CO2 pollution emission involving each application were evaluated. As a result, the application of cutting fluid by the MQL + WCJ 30° technique showed satisfactory and viable results compared to the conventional technique while presenting the lowest values of cost and pollutant emissions, extinguishing an environmental liability while contributing to the preservation of the entire ecosystem. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature."

While the concept already has a strong theoretical foundation, and many concrete policy instruments have been proposed, support for eco-social policy is still insufficient to mobilize political action. We assume that one cause of this lack of action are the diverging interests and ideologies of different classes. In this article we apply a class perspective and conduct an empirical study to explore class support for and opposition to eco-social policy. We use data from a representative survey in Germany and identify nine class fractions, based on Bourdieu's concept of social space. We first compare the carbon footprints of the classes, to determine their varying degrees of responsibility for supporting political efforts to mitigate climate change. We then compare class support for eco-social policy, considering the dimensions of redistribution, regulation and rights. We find that the economic upper class – a fraction equating closely with the ruling class – and the old working class oppose eco-social policy the most. The cultural upper class are the strongest proponents of eco-social policy. The lower-class fractions showed considerable concern about the costs associated with eco-social policy. We conclude that a stronger focus on the social justice element when designing and advocating for eco-social policy could lead to greater support from the lower classes and help to build eco-social welfare states that offer protection in times of increasing social and ecological risks. © The Author(s) 2023."

This method typically starts by using high loading metal-polymer composites/filaments as the feedstock. The rheological behavior of composite affects the maximum metal content of the feedstock, and is influenced by type of components, filler shape and size distribution, as well as additives. In this study, highly filled metal-polymer filaments, with 75 wt% nickel content dispersed in polylactic acid (PLA) matrix have been made for the first time by using a simple single-screw extruder. Using biodegradable PLA alongside recycled nickel powders, which are produced by low-carbon-footprint Mond process, take steps towards affordability and sustainability considerations. Microstructure, rheological, mechanical, and thermal properties of feedstock filaments and 3D printed parts were evaluated. Printing parameters were also optimized, and the results showed that increasing the flow rate by 10 % enhances the overall quality of the printed part and reduces the gap between the 3D printed lines. The preliminary studies on debinding/sintering post heat treatments to get fully dense nickel parts also showed promising results using the developed methodology. © 2023"

Intensified climate change and human activity are continuously altering ecosystem functions, services, and EMSs. However, numerous studies have only focused on one or a few ecosystem services, rarely taking into account spatial-temporal distribution and drivers of EMS on behalf of different agencies. We calculated EMS including pastoralist (PA), environmental protection agency (EPA), biodiversity conservation agency (BCA), and climate change mitigation agency (CCMA) using grassland production, habitat quality, water conservation, and carbon sequestration. Then, the effects of geographical features, climate factors, and human activities on spatial-temporal patterns of EMS were explored. The result indicated that EMS showed a decreasing tendency from the southeast to northwest on the Qingzang Plateau (QZP). Meanwhile, there were no obvious fluctuations in four simulated scenarios (PA, EPA, BCA and CCMA) among different vegetation types during 2000 to 2015. Notably, EMS of all simulated scenarios decreased in the alpine steppe ecosystem, but negligible changes were found in other ecosystems from 2015 to 2020. Moreover, the relative importance of precipitation in annual mean value (from 2000 to 2020) of PA, EPA, BCA and CCMA were 0.13, 0.11, 0.30 and 0.19, respectively. Overall, precipitation played the dominant role on the dynamics of EMS, followed by elevation and human footprint. Our findings highlighted that understanding the patterns and drivers of EMS could provide a reference for the regional management and maintenance of ecosystem stability on QZP. © 2023 The Authors"

Whereas genotypic water use shows little variation, it has been shown that rice varieties differ in the magnitude of their methane emissions. Management and variety-related emission factors have been proposed for modelling the impact of paddy production on climate change; however, the magnitude of a potential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by changing varieties has not yet been fully assessed. AWD has been shown to affect genotypic yields and high-yielding varieties suffer the greatest loss when grown under AWD. The highest yielding varieties may not have the highest methane emissions; thus, a potential yield loss could be compensated by a larger reduction in methane emissions. However, AWD can only be implemented under full control of irrigation water, leaving the rainy seasons with little scope to reduce methane emissions from paddy fields. Employing low-emitting varieties during the rainy season may be an option to reduce methane emissions but may compromise farmers’ income if such varieties perform less well than the current standard. Methane emissions and rice yields were determined in field trials over two consecutive winter/spring seasons with continuously flooded and AWD irrigation treatments for 20 lowland rice varieties in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam. Based on the results, this paper investigates the magnitude of methane savings through varietal choice for both AWD and continuous flooding in relation to genotypic yields and explores potential options for compensating farmers’ mitigation efforts. © 2023 The Authors.

The aim of this paper is to present an LCA analysis focused on the fabrication of the thin plates to be used for can and tray production; the work has been carried out by studying the “Laminazione Sottile” plant with a cradle-to-gate approach, considering as functional unit thin plates of two different alloys. Materials and methods: Inventory data were collected from the “Laminazione Sottile S.p.A.” plant, and off-plant emissions from external goods and fuels were accounted for based on existent LCA databases. Gabi has been used as software to model the process and calculate the impacts, while the CML method has been used. Most of the data have been directly measured in the plant during 1 year of work. Results and discussion: The results showed that the most impactful phase is the extraction of aluminum or the use of primary aluminum. Focusing the attention on the manufacturing process, the foundry is the most impacting stage, and the high energy required to melt the aluminum leads to most of the emissions. Moreover, this contribution is probably underestimated in this work because the impacts related to the manufacturing of the facilities used (furnaces and so on) are not considered. Another interesting finding is that both the supply chain and the general consumption have a non-negligible impact, highlighting the necessity to optimize these two aspects by implementing new policies for purchasing and work organization. Conclusions: The study highlighted that the production of primary aluminum is the most impacting step, followed by the foundry and the hot rolling. Production of thin aluminum plates by rolling requires a lot of energy, so the carbon footprint of these processes is quite high. The chemicals used in the rolling steps play also a role in the general impact of the whole process. The company continuously promotes improvements of the process to reduce the footprint and puts a lot of money and effort to introduce new sensors and technologies to monitor the consumptions and improve the processes. © 2023, The Author(s)."

Focusing on the relationship between sectors’ positions in the global supply chain, this study develops a structural position analysis framework based on input–output analysis. Our framework reveals the highest-priority sectors and transactions, and the best strategies for CO2 emission reduction in the global supply chain. The strategies identified focus on cross-border transactions and highlight the need for inter-sectoral and international collaboration. The results indicate that the United States and China have different priorities and characteristics (even vis-à-vis the same industry), and that joint emission reduction policies should be coordinated to take advantage of each country's emission reduction potential. Our findings suggest that, in the United States and Europe, policies to promote the reduction of direct emissions from production of goods for exports through carbon taxes are important. Contrarily, in Asian countries, carbon emissions originate mainly from intermediate goods trades, suggesting the need for mandatory life cycle assessment reporting and emissions disclosure. Our analytical framework thus proposes specific policies that could effectively reduce specific sectors' and transactions’ carbon footprints. © 2023 by the International Society for Industrial Ecology."

Dietitians require knowledge of how the therapeutic diets they prescribe may contribute to climate change. No previous research has quantified the climate footprint of therapeutic diets. This study sought to quantify and compare the climate footprint of two types of therapeutic diets for people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) with two reference diets. Methods: A usual diet for an individual with CKD and a novel plant-based diet for CKD were compared with the current Australian diet and the Australian-adapted EAT Lancet Planetary Health Diet (PHD). The climate footprint of these diets was measured using the Global Warming Potential (GWP*) metric for a reference 71-year-old male. Results: No diets analysed were climate neutral, and therefore, all contribute to climate change. The novel plant-based diet for CKD (1.20 kg carbon dioxide equivalents [CO2e] per day) produced 35% less CO2e than the usual renal diet for an individual with CKD (1.83 kg CO2e per day) and 50% less than the current Australian diet (2.38 kg CO2e per day). The Australian-adapted EAT Lancet PHD (1.04 kg CO2e per day) produced the least amount of CO2e and 56% less than the current Australian diet. The largest contributors to the climate footprint of all four diets were foods from the meats and alternatives, dairy and alternatives and discretionary food groups. Conclusions: Dietetic advice to reduce the climate footprint of therapeutic diets for CKD should focus on discretionary foods and some animal-based products. Future research is needed on other therapeutic diets. © 2023 The Authors. Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British Dietetic Association."

The present work shows the latest achievements of Sunfire's development based on the results of the project GrInHy2.0 demonstrating hydrogen production (solid oxide electrolysis cell [SOEC]) in an industrial environment and the project SynLink demonstrating co-electrolysis (Co-SOEC) for renewable synthesis gas production. The GrInHy2.0 system is a 720 kWAC electrolyzer operating in the iron-and-steel works Salzgitter (Germany). It is now in operation for approx. 14,500 h and achieved a mean degradation rate below 23 mOhm cm2 kh−1 and an electrical efficiency of up to 84%LHV. It also proved that HTE now reached industrial-relevant availability of over 90%. While the HTE system in Salzgitter consists of eight modules, a single module was tested in co-electrolysis mode within the project SynLink. It demonstrated synthesis gas generation via Co-SOEC with a flexible H2/CO ratio between 1 and 4.

The early detection of diseases is crucial to witnessing the efficiency and progress of the aquaponics system. Aquaponics combines recirculating aquaculture and soilless hydroponics methods and promises to ensure food security, reduce water scarcity, and eliminate carbon footprint. For the large-scale implementation of this farming technique, a unified system is needed that can detect crop diseases and support researchers and farmers in identifying potential causes and treatments at early stages. This study proposes an automatic crop diagnostic system for detecting biotic stresses and managing diseases in four leafy green crops, lettuce, basil, spinach, and parsley, grown in an aquaponics facility. First, a dataset comprising 2640 images is constructed. Then, a disease detection system is developed that works in three phases. The first phase is a crop classification system that identifies the type of crop. The second phase is a disease identification system that determines the crop's health status. The final phase is a disease detection system that localizes and detects the diseased and healthy spots in leaves and categorizes the disease. The proposed approach has shown promising results with accuracy in each of the three phases, reaching 95.83%, 94.13%, and 82.13%, respectively. The final disease detection system is then integrated with an ontology model through a cloud-based application. This ontology model contains domain knowledge related to crop pathology, particularly causes and treatments of different diseases of the studied leafy green crops, which can be automatically extracted upon disease detection allowing agricultural practitioners to take precautionary measures. The proposed application finds its significance as a decision support system that can automate aquaponics facility health monitoring and assist agricultural practitioners in decision-making processes regarding crop and disease management. © 2023 The Authors"

Here, we report an approach to reduce gaseous emissions of CO2 and NH3 from animal housing while simultaneously using them to produce value-added biomass. To this end, a cone-shaped, helical photobioreactor was developed that can be integrated into animal housing by being freely suspended, thereby combining a small footprint with a physically robust design. The photobioreactor was coupled with the exhaust air of a chicken house to allow continuous cultivation of a mixed culture of Arthrospira spec. (Spirulina). Continuous quantification of CO2 and NH3 concentration showed that the coupled algae reactor effectively purifies the exhaust air from the chicken house while producing algal biomass. Typical production rates of greater than 0.3 g/l*day dry mass were obtained, and continuous operation was possible for several weeks. Morphological, biochemical, and genomic characterization of Spirulina cultures yielded insights into the dynamics and metabolic processes of the microbial community. We anticipate that further optimization of this approach will provide new opportunities for the generation of value-added products from gaseous CO2 and NH3 waste emissions, linking resource-efficient production of microalgae with simultaneous sequestration of animal emissions. Key points: • Coupling a bioreactor with exhaust gases of chicken coop for production of biomass. • Spirulina mixed culture removes CO2 and NH3 from chicken house emissions. • High growth rates and biodiversity adaptation for nitrogen metabolism. Graphical abstract: Towards a sustainable circular economy in livestock farming. The functional coupling of a helical tube photobioreactor with exhaust air from a chicken house enabled the efficient cultivation of Spirulina microalgae while simultaneously sequestering the animals’ CO2 and NH3 emissions.

However, network operators face the challenge of ensuring efficient resource provisioning while balancing profit maximization and environmental objectives. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as an approach for resource allocation, leveraging observed data to make near-optimal decisions. However, the dynamic and complex nature of large-scale environments, such as wireless networks, poses challenges in designing appropriate rewards for DRL agents. This study investigates the feasibility of parallelization approaches to create network environments that facilitate efficient and generalizable learning for DRL algorithms. We propose two service provisioning solutions: DRL-MCTS for wireless networks and DRL-VNF for wired networks. These solutions prioritize green network objectives, including minimizing power consumption for nodes and links and selecting low carbon-emitting links. We compare our proposals to baseline methods, including a greedy algorithm, WMMSE, and the optimal solution. Through extensive experimental evaluations, our methods demonstrate significant improvements in reducing the network's environmental footprint while meeting Quality of Service requirements. In specific scenarios, our proposed solutions outperform the baseline approaches by up to 55%.  © 2017 IEEE."

Many Americans take voluntary actions—e.g., recycling waste or buying “green” products—to reduce their carbon footprints. Environmentalist organizations have long promoted this behavior through their communications. Experts, meanwhile, have debated the effects of this framing choice, as individual action alone is insufficient for addressing the climate challenge. Some even suggest that emphasizing personal action depoliticizes environmental issues, weakening the capacity for collective action. Little is known, however, about when and where the personal responsibility frame emerged. We begin to fill this gap by (1) developing a theory about why a personal responsibility frame is expected to have deleterious consequences for environmental organizations like the Sierra Club, (2) tracing the over-time development of the frame by analyzing a multi-decade corpus of Sierra Club magazines, which shows that the emphasis on voluntary individual action accelerated rapidly in the 1980s, and (3) offering some potential explanations for the timing of this shift. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited."

To fill the gap of incorporating ecological and socioeconomic systems of ecological restoration projects, this study established a cost-benefit evaluation framework that integrated the carbon footprint based on life cycle assessment and a carbon price measurement model based on the Slack-Based Measure-Data Envelopment Analysis model. Taking a ‘Returning Grazing Land to Grassland Project’ on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau as a case, this study quantified the carbon footprint of three different ecological measurements, including fences construction (released 107 kgCO2-eq·hm−2 and absorbed 322 kgCO2-eq·hm−2), degenerated grassland improvement (released 1080 kgCO2-eq·hm−2 and absorbed 580 kgCO2-eq·hm−2) and artificial grassland planting (released 2540 kgCO2-eq·hm−2 and absorbed 6540 kgCO2-eq·hm−2). Raw material production was the largest emitter. In addition, we calculated the carbon price in the grassland ecosystem by the carbon price measurement model, at 1.06 yuan·kgCO2-eq−1 on average during 2011–2018. In the cost-benefit analysis, the total carbon sequestration benefits (8.90 × 106 yuan) outweighed the total carbon emission costs (4.26 × 106 yuan). Optimizing the usage and transportation of building materials and the application of fertilizer can benefit carbon emission mitigation and enhancement of carbon sequestration capacity in grassland.

However, research and development of novel energy system abstraction layers and interfaces remain difficult due to the scarcity of available testing environments: Real testbeds are expensive to build and maintain, while existing simulation testbeds are unable to interact with real computing systems. To provide a widely applicable approach for developing and testing carbon-aware software, we propose a method for integrating real applications into a simulated energy system through software-in-the-loop simulation. The integration offers an API for accessing the energy system, while continuously modeling the computing system's power demand within the simulation. Our system allows for the integration of physical as well as virtual compute nodes, and can help accelerate research on carbon-aware computing systems in the future. © 2023 The Authors.

841,Environmental assessment of hard coal char as a carbon reductant for silicon alloys production,Article,Knigawka P.A.; Ganczewski G.J.,International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment,28.0,2023,1640,1657,10.1007/s11367-023-02233-2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85173749048&doi=10.1007%2fs11367-023-02233-2&partnerID=40&md5=53ad48cc4c03ee68185c4828dc717247,09483349,Scopus,Carbon reductant; Char; Coal utilisation; Environmental Footprint 3.0; LCA; Reducing agent; Silicon production,"Purpose: This paper explores a life cycle assessment (LCA) case study of two char carbon reductants for silicon alloys production, manufactured from Polish and Colombian hard coal. Life cycle assessment (LCA) of chars has not been thoroughly analysed and described in the scientific literature and the studies on high silicon alloys tend to focus solely on climate change with smaller consideration of other important environmental issues. Methods: This cradle-to-gate LCA of chars uses 1 tonne of final product as a functional unit. The method chosen for the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) is Environmental Footprint 3.0 (EF 3.0) and five impact categories from the method were chosen for presenting environmental impacts (climate change, particulate matter, freshwater eutrophication, freshwater ecotoxicity, and fossil resource use), with remaining available in supplementary materials. Results and discussion: While the carbon footprint for char produced from Polish coal is 13% higher than for char derived from Colombian and amounts, respectively, to 1554.4 and 1373.3 kg CO2 eq, the freshwater ecotoxicity for char from Colombian coal achieving 113,956 CTUe outperforms the result of 11,749 CTUe measured for Polish char. When applying weighting aggregated into single score results, Polish and Colombian char obtained, respectively, 109.4 mPt and 160.1 mPt. Activities relating to the manufacturing stage had the largest impact on climate change and particulate matter due to the coal devolatilisation process but mining operations were most damaging to freshwater eutrophication, ecotoxicity, and fossil resource use. The paper also investigates and presents potential optimisation opportunities in the area of char production. Conclusions and recommendations: A comparative life cycle assessment of two chars fills the research gap in the literature. Results for selected impact categories of EF 3.0 method for both Polish and Colombian chars show variability of environmental loads, but clearly suggest that the greatest environmental burdens concern the coal extraction process. Most scientific literature on the metallurgy industry focuses on carbon footprint as the most important impact. While the carbon footprint of Polish char is slightly higher than that of its Colombian counterpart, other environmental impact categories can exhibit opposite trends. This is especially significant in the freshwater ecotoxicity category, which is ten times higher for Colombian char and can be attributed to the open-cast mining process. Therefore, it is important to analyse chars in terms of alternative technological solutions aimed at maintaining optimal usability in all life cycle stages, taking into account a holistic view to possibilities of reducing environmental impacts. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
842,Increasing temporal resolution in greenhouse gas accounting of electricity consumption divided into Scopes 2 and 3: case study of Germany,Article,Blizniukova D.; Holzapfel P.; Unnewehr J.F.; Bach V.; Finkbeiner M.,International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment,28.0,2023,1622,1639,10.1007/s11367-023-02240-3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174387857&doi=10.1007%2fs11367-023-02240-3&partnerID=40&md5=eacf5311f5e2f9cc4dab94952f1ee6d3,09483349,Scopus,Carbon footprint; Emission factors; Energy transition; Greenhouse gas (GHG) protocol; Open access data; Temporal variability,"Purpose: As renewable energy sources (RES) experience short-term variability, electricity greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions also fluctuate. Increasing temporal resolution in electricity emissions accounting allows capturing these fluctuations. However, existing time-resolved models either neglect indirect impacts, adopt a generation perspective, or are based on non-public country-specific data. We provide an approach for calculating time-resolved GHG emission factors (EFs) of electricity consumption based on open access data for European countries and examine the temporal variability of German EFs. Methods: Time-resolved electricity GHG EFs are calculated within the framework of attributional life cycle assessment (LCA) with up to quarter-hourly resolution. The approach involves top-down calculation of annual combustion emissions, validation and scaling of time-resolved electricity generation data, as well as calculation of inland consumption EFs for each interval throughout a year. The EFs are divided by the stages of net generation, consumption by hydro-pumped storage (HPS), and transmission and distribution (T&D) losses, as well as Scopes 2 and 3, enabling GHG Protocol Corporate Standard-compliant reporting. The approach is exemplarily applied to Germany and its transmission system operator zones at quarter-hourly resolution for the years from 2017 to 2020 to investigate the relation between grid mix composition and temporal variability of EFs. Results and discussion: The annual average EF of the German consumption mix, encompassing direct and upstream emissions, declined from 499 (2017) to 377 g CO2e/kWh (2020), while quarter-hourly variability increased by 12%. Neglecting upstream emissions and intermediate steps between generation and consumption in Germany in 2020 resulted in an underestimation of 13% on an annual level, while quarter-hourly Scope 3 EFs reached up to 100 g CO2e/kWh. On a sub-national level, annual average EFs varied between 157 g CO2e/kWh (TenneT zone) and 505 g CO2e/kWh (50Hertz zone) in 2020. Temporal variability is the greatest in electricity systems with both fossil-fuel and renewable capacity sufficient to dominate short-term electricity generation. At an advanced level of RES integration, the fluctuations of EFs start declining, as demonstrated by the TenneT case. Conclusion: An increased temporal resolution in electricity emissions accounting can enhance a posteriori LCA results’ accuracy during the energy transition phase. The provided EFs link the life cycle-based perspective with time-resolved emissions accounting. With increasing reliance on RES, indirect emissions, including those related to energy storage, will gain in significance. The next step should focus on integrating physical cross-border electricity exchanges to complete the consumption perspective, as well as examining practical implementation to other countries. © 2023, The Author(s)."

One primary approach involves implementing effective heat recovery strategies to generate various products. The present study suggests a novel approach to heat recovery in different stages utilizing series and parallel arrangements within an environmentally friendly design to enhance controllability while expanding the range of products. The present study includes a steam methane reforming process, a Kalina cycle, a multi-effect desalination unit, a methanol synthesis unit, two organic Rankine cycles, and two ammonia Rankine cycles. The primary objective of this system is to efficiently and concurrently produce electricity, hot water, chilled water, fresh water, and methanol. The findings reveal that the newly devised process exhibits energy and exergy efficiencies of 47.55% and 50.58%, respectively, while the total unit cost of products amounts to 7.69 $/GJ. From an environmental perspective, the results indicate that the proposed structure exhibits a total net emission of 87.1 × 103 kg/h and a CO2 footprint of 0.22 kgCO2/kWh.

To investigate the effect of heat flux and grain direction on the combustion properties of parallel strand bamboo (PSB), laminated veneer bamboo (LVB), cross-laminated timber (CLT), and laminated veneer lumber (LVL), a total of 54 specimens in 3 groups were tested through a cone calorimeter. Parameters including the ignition time, heat release rate, mass loss rate, and smoke production rate were investigated. The analytic hierarchy process method was adopted for a multi-level, qualitative, and quantitative comprehensive fire risk assessment of the corresponding structural materials. The test results reveal that PSB and LVB demonstrated superior performance to the CLT and LVL through the comparison of four combustion characteristics parameters, despite their drawbacks and virtues. The heat flux increases in inverse proportion to the ignition time. As for the heat release rate, the larger peak value is accompanied by an earlier appearance, along with the greater average mass loss rate and the lower smoke rate of engineered bamboo. The peak heat release rate of engineered bamboo composites parallel to the grain is larger than that perpendicular to the grain, whereas other parameters are not significantly influenced by the grain direction. Compared with engineered wood, engineered bamboo composites have the potential to be a safer and more reliable building material in terms of fire risk assessment. Highlights: Cone calorimeter was used to analyze the combustion properties of materials. PSB, LVB, CLT, and LVL were studied considering different grain directions. Analytic hierarchy process method was adopted for a fire risk assessment. Engineered bamboo has the potential to be a reliable building material. © 2023 Society of Plastics Engineers."

However, DLaaS can also introduce enormous computing power consumption at the service ends. Existing works focus on the optimization of the training process such as using low-cost chips or optimizing the training settings for better energy efficiency. In this paper, we revisit this issue from an adversary perspective which attempts to maliciously make victims waste more training efforts without being noticed. In particular, we propose a novel attack targeting enlarging the training costs stealthily via poisoning the training data. By adopting the Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) method to generate poisoned samples, we show that attackers can significantly increase the training costs by as much as 88% in both the white-box scenario and the black-box scenario with a very tiny influence on the model’s accuracy. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

We report the feasibility and outcome of the first study of this novel concept in our hospital. We conducted a prospective audit of self-TWOC (trial without catheter) in men who underwent consecutive RARP in our centre between April 2022 and September 2022. Men who had self-TWOC filled a questionnaire about the outcomes of self-TWOC. Carbon footprint and carbon offset for each hospital TWOC avoided were calculated. Of the 129 who underwent self-TWOC, 112 filled the questionnaire and were hence included in the final analysis. Self-TWOC was successful in all the 112 (100%) men in the study. 99.1% of men were satisfied with self-TWOC at home. We managed to avoid 79.6 ± 36.72 km of travel and 77 min of travel time for every self-TWOC. This also saved 85£/patient on clinic expenses and fuel cost savings of 9.87–15.99£ per patient depending on car engine size/type. The carbon footprint calculated was 20 kg CO2 assuming average engine sized diesel/petrol cars and 10 kg CO2 for an average UK petrol hybrid car. The calculated carbon offset per patient for diesel/petrol cars: 0.32£, petrol hybrid: 0.16£. Self-TWOC for 80–160 patients will save the carbon emissions equivalent to that of a passenger on a London–New York Trans-Atlantic flight. Self-TWOC is safe, affordable and is sustainable to the environment. Widespread acceptance of this practice change will be a small, but steady step towards greener health systems across the world. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature."

This article contributes to the research on sustainable welfare and eco-social policies by examining transformative and integrative eco-social initiatives that aim to reduce environmental impacts while also ensuring that public actors have the capacities to reach legally binding social outcomes and enhance social inclusion. Theoretically, we combine welfare state transformation research with the concepts of social-ecological systems, provisioning systems and transformative capacity. Our empirical cases in Finland include public actors promoting sustainable public procurement, a network of carbon-neutral municipalities, sustainable lifestyles accelerators at the household level, and carbon footprint calculators as a potential free-to-use technique that supports widespread carbon reductions. We apply a qualitative research design to investigate what kinds of factors are crucial in enhancing the transformative capacity of provisioning systems and how various factors in practice enable the eco-social initiatives to support the transformation towards an eco-welfare state. Our findings identify key enabling factors for transformative capacity: social networks, collaboration and participation; knowledge, learning and monitoring; shared policy frameworks and visions; and financial resources. These factors are interrelated and can be brought to bear in no particular sequence. The results offer valuable insights into how welfare state characteristics with democratically governed public actors may facilitate transformation. © The Author(s) 2023."

Copper slag, as an abundant metallurgical waste containing substantial amount of Si and Fe resources, was being explored as cheap raw material for the preparation of lithium-based sorbent. The results shows that the lithiation is initiated at 450–600 °C, where fayalite and magnetite in slag are firstly oxidized by released water vapor from the decomposition of LiOH, then further react with Li2O to form Li4SiO4 and LiFeO2. As the temperature rises, the conversion of LiFeO2 to Li5FeO4 and incorporation of Fe3+, Al3+ into Li4SiO4 lattice occur in parallel. The resulting sorbent exhibited excellent CO2 chemisorption ability with a capture capacity of 420 mg/gmaterial at 725 °C. Particularly, even in the gas stream containing 5 vol% CO2, it showed a CO2 uptake capacity of 383 mg/gmaterial. In the CO2 cycling tests, the sorbent suffered a decay in sorption capacity, which was ascribed to the poor regeneration ability of Li5FeO4. Comparatively, it possesses a relatively high capacity of 241 mg/gmaterial in 20 vol% CO2 after 20 cycles, which is higher than those of previously reported Li-silicate sorbents derived from wastes. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l."

This study proposes an integrative approach to evaluate the global toxicity footprint by combining multiple databases, inventorying methods gap-filling/extrapolation techniques, and environmentally extended multi-region input–output models. We incorporated industrial, residential, and agricultural emissions of 693 chemicals into air, water, and soil, assessing the toxicity footprints of 49 countries and regions and revealing the displacement of toxic impacts across regions and nations. Our results emphasize the significant sensitivity of emission inventories and toxicity footprints to the choice of extrapolation procedures in regionalized chemical inventory development. Despite considerable progress in consolidating emission data, major gaps persist in publicly available datasets, impeding accurate extrapolation of global pollutant releases and comprehensive analysis of toxicity footprints. Primary data require refinement, harmonization, and expansion to enhance toxicity footprints' accuracy, particularly concerning pesticide emissions and national Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers initiatives. This study offers crucial insights for national and regional policymakers, facilitating the creation of targeted regulations and incentives to mitigate toxic substances' environmental impact. Future research should prioritize developing input–output table projections, deriving forward-looking time series of national emission inventories, and establishing absolute thresholds for toxic impacts within the framework of environmentally sustainable societies. © 2023 The Authors.

In this work, we present results from three life cycle assessments (LCAs) on Easyhaler dry powder inhaler product portfolio and assess the changes in environmental impact and carbon footprint (CF) of the products over time. Methods: Three cradle-to-grave LCAs were conducted in 2019, 2021, and 2023. The 2019 assessment covered four products while 2021 and 2023 assessments included all six products in the portfolio. LCA for the protective cover sometimes used with Easyhaler was conducted in 2023. In addition to CF, nine other environmental impact categories were assessed to ensure that no burden shifting occurs. Results: During the study period, the non-weighted average CF of the Easyhaler decreased by 11.2%. For individual products, the decrease varied from 5.0 to 6.8% between the assessments. In the latest assessment, the average CF of Easyhaler was 547 gCO2e with a range of 452–617 gCO2e. The LCA of the protective cover was assessed for the first time in 2023 and had a CF of 66 gCO2e. Conclusions: Our results show that the climate impact of pharmaceutical products can be reduced without making changes to the product itself. The CF of Easyhaler products is in agreement with the lower end of the CF range previously reported for dry powder inhalers. Climate impact from the protective cover was one-tenth compared to the climate impact from the product itself. © 2023, The Author(s)."

Using a methodological framework focusing on cross-sectional dependence and cross-sectional heterogeneity, the panel data approach is based on the Augmented Mean Group and Common Correlated Effects Mean Group estimators, as well as the panel causality test of Juodis, Karavias and Sarafidis (2021). Taking the reference period 2002–2019 the analysis for a sample of countries that were the largest consumers of nuclear energy in the European Union during this period, namely Belgium, Germany, France, Sweden, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Spain, Finland, and The Netherlands, suggests that industry development is a source of pollution, while governance could control environmental degradation through certain measures. Specifically, a lack of sufficient environmental laws, regulations, and policies enhances pollution even in countries with political stability and effective governance. These findings form the basis for future policy recommendations that should consider more green jobs and green technology in industry and a better legislative framework for pollution control © 2022"

A comprehensive environmental assessment of EFB biorefineries is critical for determining their sustainability in parallel with the bioeconomy policy. Nonetheless, no life cycle assessment (LCA) has been performed on co-producing food and biochemicals (furfural and glucose) derived from EFB biomass. This research is the first to evaluate the environmental performance of the furfural and glucose co-production processes from EFB biomass. Environmental analysis is conducted using a prospective gate-to-gate LCA for four impact categories, including global warming potential (GWP), acidification (ADP), eutrophication (EP), and human toxicity (HT). Aspen Plus is used to simulate the co-production process of furfural and glucose as well as generate mass and energy balances for LCA inventory data usage. The findings suggest that the environmental footprint in respect of GWP, ADP, EP, and HT is 4846.85 kg CO2 equivalent per ton EFB, 7.24 kg SO2 equivalent per ton EFB, 1.52 kg PO4 equivalent per ton EFB, and 2.62E-05 kg 1,4-DB equivalent per ton EFB, respectively. The normalized overall impact scores for GWP, ADP, EP, and HT are 1.16E-10, 2.28E-11, 6.12E-10, and 2.18E-17 years/ton of EFB, respectively. In summary, the proposed integrated plant is not only economically profitable but also environmentally sustainable. In the attempt to enhance the Malaysian economic sector based on the EFB, this study has the potential to serve as an indicator of the environmental sustainability of the palm oil industry.

This study established a carbon neutral calculation framework for the Qomolangma mountaineering tourism area using the “bottom-up” tourism carbon footprint analysis model and a carbon sink calculation model. Three types of data were obtained through field surveys, Internet searches, and literature review and used for the subsequent quantitative analysis. The results showed that: (1) in 2019, the case site had a carbon surplus, with a total 3.87E + 06 kg in carbon emissions and a total 3.22E + 09 kg in carbon sequestration capacity; (2) among the carbon sources, tourist catering accounted for 45.78% of the total, which was the largest share, followed by transportation at 39.83%; the carbon footprint of waste was the smallest, accounting for only 0.66%; and (3) according to the current carbon price in China, the Qomolangma mountaineering tourism area should have theoretically been compensated with 1.15E + 07 CNY (equivalent to 1.67E + 06 USD) in 2019.

Among battery EV designs, a dual-motor configuration is introduced as a promising solution to improve dynamic performance and energy efficiency. In this study, a novel energy management strategy framework based on an Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is proposed for torque distribution optimization between two different motors. At first, Dynamic Programming (DP) is employed to find global optimization of the torque distribution. After training with the DP-obtained data set, the ANFIS model can execute a torque distribution online. By minimizing the battery energy consumption, the motor torque-speed solution pair is found under representative driving cycles (only three cycles). In addition, the best ANFIS model has been selected using a clustering technique, goodness-of-fit metrics, and sensitivity analysis. This distinguishes the optimization problem in this study from previously published literatures. The simulation results show that over an unknown Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) cycle, the torque prediction using this ANFIS model achieves 98.3% of the benchmark DP result. As a result, the overall efficiency of the proposed strategy is increased to 73.3%, which is 3.4% higher than that of the rule-based method. Furthermore, the signal hardware-in-the-loop (S-HIL) experiments validate the real-time prediction of the ANFIS-based approach.  © 1986-2012 IEEE."

These biodegradable polyesters can in fact be produced by fermentation from bacteria like Cupriavidus necator, thus reducing the environmental footprint of the manufacturing process. However, ensuring consistent product quality attributes is a major challenge of biomanufacturing. To address this issue, the implementation of real-time monitoring tools is essential to increase process understanding, enable a prompt response to possible process deviations and realize on-line process optimization. In this work, a soft sensor based on in situ Raman spectroscopy was developed and applied to the in-line monitoring of PHA biomanufacturing. This strategy allows the collection of quantitative information directly from the culture broth, without the need for sampling, and at high frequency. In fact, through an optimized multivariate data analysis pipeline, this soft sensor allows monitoring cell dry weight, as well as carbon and nitrogen source concentrations with root mean squared errors (RMSE) equal to 3.71, 7 and 0.03 g/L, respectively. In addition, this tool allows the in-line monitoring of intracellular PHA accumulation, with an RMSE of 14 gPHA/gCells. For the first time, also the number and weight average molecular weights of the polymer produced could be monitored, with RMSE of 8.7E4 and 11.6E4 g/mol, respectively. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of Raman spectroscopy in the in-line monitoring of biotechnology processes, leading to the simultaneous measurement of several process variables in real time without the need of sampling and labor-intensive sample preparations. © 2023 The Authors"

In this study, we assess the nutritional quality and the carbon footprint of 2020 school menus served in 101 municipalities in the inner suburbs of Paris. In this sample, school canteens menus meet an average 8.2/15 (min = 4, max = 14) adequacy score to the regulatory nutritional quality frequency criteria and their carbon footprint averages at 1.9 (min = 1.2, max = 2.6) kgCO2e/day. The nutritional and environmental qualities of canteen menus were not correlated with each other. In-house canteens have a significantly higher nutritional quality - 0.7 more points - and so do larger canteens. The carbon footprint significantly decreases with an increasing education level of the population and, for in-house canteens, it also decreases by 0.16 kgCO2e/day with a ten-fold increase in canteen size and by 0.0035 kgCO2e/day per percent of left-wing vote, breaking even with delegated canteens above 3500 enrolled children and 53% of left-wing vote respectively. The frequency of certified food (mean = 18%, min = 0%, max = 51%), a cornerstone of the 2018 national law aiming at more sustainable institutional catering, has no impact on our indicators of nutritional quality and carbon footprint. The substantial variations between canteens in both nutritional and environmental qualities suggests that there is room for improvement on both ends.  © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston."

The correct utilization of stone aggregates is one of the key goals of this study. For parametric study, finite element approach is used to analyze granular pile with six recycled materials: brick, recycled concrete aggregate, sandstone, granite, limestone, and marble. FEM-based program has been developed to predict the results, i.e., the settlement response of granular pile, variation of stress concentration ratio with modular ratio, and variation of settlement reduction ratio with modular ratio for different values of penetration of granular pile. For alternate materials, stress concentration ratio and settlement reduction ratio at different surcharges has been shown. The degree of carbon footprint for alternate materials are also displayed. It was discovered that marble has maximum stress concentration ratio and minimum settlement reduction ratio, whereas crushed brick has minimum stress concentration ratio under 150 kPa. The inclusion carbon footprint displays that the maximum embodied carbon (kgCO2/ton) is employed for crushed brick of 220. The outcomes are suitable for soft soil improvement works as a regular aggregate in load bearing, filling, and infiltrating materials. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

F-gases are an especially powerful set of GHGs with a global warming potential hundreds to thousands of times greater than that of CO2. Design/methodology/approach: The significant impact of CO2e is tested by means of an empirical study with current consumption data from German food retail warehouses. This evaluation involves the analysis of the Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor's country- and property-type specific pathway, coupled with a paired samples t-test to examine the hypotheses. The assessment is undertaken by evaluating the type of gas and the amount of leakage reported in the baseline year, subsequently converting these values to CO2e units. Findings: On average, F-gases account for 40% of total building emissions and nearly 45% of cumulative emissions until 2050. In light of ongoing climate change and the rising number of Cooling Degree Days (CDDs), it becomes imperative to assess both the environmental and economic impact of F-gases and to transition toward environmentally friendly refrigerants. Originality/value: The analysis sheds light on the seldom-addressed threats posed by CO2e emissions stemming from refrigerant losses. By identifying these threats, investors can devise strategies to mitigate potential future costs and carbon risks. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Data centers are claimed to be the second most significant contributor of the havoc greenhouse gasses. This paper deals with modeling carbon footprint of green data centers. Initially, we use a panel dataset of a green data center that mostly relies on green energy resources for power. Our study reveals that in spite of massive renewable energy usage, the carbon footprint trend of this data center is quite significant. Alongside, due to massive nuclear energy usage in this data center, a hefty amount of nuclear waste is generated causing a global threat to sustainability. This is a novel paper that pinpoints that though green data centers claim they are zero-carbon data centers but the reality is different. We prove that green data centers also emit significant amount of greenhouse gasses and cause danger to sustainability. Alongside, we provide a nuclear footprint estimator that effectively calculates the nuclear emission and carbon footprint from the data center each hour. We also provide a remedy to this entire situation and provide a carbon footprint model in this paper that optimizes the total carbon emission from this green data center. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Islamic Azad University."

Not only is the magnitude of the mobility carbon footprint large, but its dynamics make reducing it very challenging. Our paper addresses the impact of crises on the transformation of mobility patterns, including short-distance mobility and holiday tourism. A first study was conducted after the 2008–2010 crisis using focus-group participatory systems mapping. This found that when people are forced to change their habits for financial reasons, they adapt holiday travel first. Nonetheless, participants were just as satisfied with domestic destinations, provided they could spend time with loved ones. The second study focused on the COVID-19 crisis. Participants missed foreign travel, so some rebound seems inevitable. However, the crisis has been an incubator of changes in urban mobility that could reduce carbon footprints in the longer term and offset the prospective increase in tourism. Recent changes have been more profound and innovative than those during the 2008–2010 crisis. © 2023 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Thus, the persistent degradation in the global environment has become a concerning issue for both developed and developing regions across the world. Against this backdrop, this study checks how the per capita carbon footprint figures of the developed Group of Seven (G7) and the developing Emerging Seven (E7) countries are influenced by energy productivity improvement, institutional quality, and other key macroeconomic factors. Considering annual data from 2000 to 2020, advanced panel data estimation techniques that are robust against data-related problems such as endogeneity, heterogeneous slope coefficients, and dependency among the cross-sectional units are utilized. Overall, the results certify that making productive use of energy reduces consumption-based carbon footprints in E7 countries but not in G7 countries. Besides, improving institutional quality is seen to not only reduce carbon footprints in both samples directly but also indirectly mediate and moderate the energy productivity-carbon footprint nexus in G7 and E7 countries, respectively. Moreover, financial globalization is observed to minimize carbon footprints in G7 countries while boosting them in E7 countries. Contrastingly, financial development is observed to homogeneously boost the carbon footprint levels of both G7 and E7 countries. Lastly, international trade is found not to influence the carbon footprint levels in both samples of countries. Therefore, taking these major findings into consideration, a set of policies apart from making optimal use of energy are recommended for inhibiting the consumption-based carbon footprint figures of the concerned countries. © 2023 International Association for Gondwana Research"

The cost of power generation is considerable in those areas, because the diesel fuel must be carried by truck or ship and a fuel reserve must be held on-site in case of expected demand or weather closure. Moreover, Australia has an energy security issue in relation to liquid fuels. Australia is reliant on imported fuel such as diesel to fill the shortage, as domestic production and supply are unable to fulfil domestic demand. As a result, by deploying hybrid integrated renewable energy systems in remote areas, isolated communities may lower their power prices, enjoy a more secure and dependable source of electricity and minimise their carbon footprint by eliminating or reducing the usage of diesel. In this study, an extensive literature review has been conducted focussing on renewable resources for Australia and Far North Queensland, different hybrid energy systems including energy storage, and finally highlights the alternative clean and renewable energy options for Far North Queensland (FNQ) remote communities. In addition, this study has performed an assessment of renewable energy available from solar and wind resources considering climatic, geographical and economic aspects for FNQ. The literature review and the assessment show that solar and wind resources including hydrogen storage have significant potential for energy solution of FNQ. The assessment results indicate that selected regions of FNQ have suitable land area of 142,294.86 km2 (55.94% of total selected areas) for solar and 144,563.80 km2 (56.83% of total selected areas) for wind. The total calculated potential power can be 14,448 GW from solar PV and 1040.97 GW from wind energy. This study provides a significant pathway for parties interested in investing in renewable energy in FNQ. Moreover, knowing a land’s suitability will increase confidence and hence speed up the renewable energy investment. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Islamic Azad University."

The basic objective of this study is to evaluate and compare the impact of green–blue revolution on sustainable environment in different quantiles. Johansen co-integration test with trace and max eigenvalues determines the long-run relationship between green–blue revolution and environmental degradation in Pakistan. Using median quantile regression analysis, we find that agricultural machinery, pesticides, and aquaculture production are positive and significant factors of production-based carbon emissions with 0.49, 0.1, and 0.09 coefficient values, respectively, while fertilizers, agricultural credit, and HYV (high yield variety) seeds are not major determinants of production-based carbon emission. At the same time, high variety seeds and fertilizers enhance the agro-environmental footprint in Pakistan with 0.23 and 0.28 coefficients, respectively, by applying median quantile regression. Similarly, agricultural machinery, pesticides, agricultural credit, and aquaculture production are not the major determinants of agro-environmental footprint by using median quantile regression. However, the response of exogenous variables varies from quantile to quantile in the case of both environmental proxies. These results discuss implications for fruitful and effective policies and recommendations for a sustainable environment. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."

However, PLA must still be recycled, and its growing popularity and mixture with PET plastics at the disposal stage poses a cross-contamination threat in existing recycling facilities and results in low-value and low-quality recycled products. Hybrid upcycling has been proposed as a promising sustainable solution for mixed plastic waste, but its techno-economic and life cycle environmental performance remain understudied. Here we propose a hybrid upcycling approach using a biocompatible ionic liquid (IL) to first chemically depolymerize plastics and then convert the depolymerized stream via biological upgrading with no extra separation. We show that over 95% of mixed PET/PLA was depolymerized into the respective monomers, which then served as the sole carbon source for the growth of Pseudomonas putida, enabling the conversion of the depolymerized plastics into biodegradable polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). In comparison to conventional commercial PHAs, the estimated optimal production cost and carbon footprint are reduced by 62% and 29%, respectively. © 2023"

This study aims to analyse the food menus in a Turkish university refectory concerning sustainable nutrition and waste management and compare them with a proposed sustainable food menu. Design/methodology/approach: The study examined lunch menus served in December and February 2021–2022 at Istanbul Medipol University refectory for a total of 20 days, considering the nutrient-rich food index (NRF 9.3), waste amount, food cost, water and carbon footprint parameters of the meals. Findings: Comparing the December menu with the suggested sustainable December menu showed a significant reduction in carbon and water footprint (p = 0.001), food cost (p = 0.001) and NRF 9.3 score (p = 0.001). When February and the suggested sustainable February menu were compared, there was a significant decrease in carbon and water footprint (p = 0.001), food cost (p = 0.005) and NRF 9.3 score (p = 0.001). December and February menus had higher NRF 9.3 score compared to the sample sustainable menus, and the amounts of saturated fat, added sugar and sodium were also high in these menus. Originality/value: The study revealed that university cafeteria menus are incompatible with sustainable nutrition. The findings can significantly contribute to improving the sustainability of meals and food services by minimizing the water and carbon footprint of menus. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Now excess climate-related deaths have mounted to more than 5 million people per year. In this Intelligence Briefing, we identify a few targeted driving actions through economic taxation, ending subsidies, and pursuit of legal cases for climate homicide, among many others. Scientists can play a vital role in providing supporting scientific evidence for policies and prosecutions, and model climate behaviors in their personal and professional lives. Technical summary Based on our analysis of the current global situation regarding carbon (CO2) in the atmosphere, we note that the earth has reached a dangerous 420 ppm, compared to staying under the 350 ppm necessary for human sustainability; and carbon concentration in the atmosphere is still climbing, as fossil fuel firms are continuing to delay and dilute regulatory efforts. This paper suggests action on several fronts. Governments can impose improved taxation regimes that involve unitary, windfall, and luxury taxes on carbon and the consumption of natural assets. Cutting subsidies to fossil fuel firms via COP actions can reduce carbon, by making renewable energy more competitive. We suggest recognizing the excess deaths by carbon pollution as homicide and charging responsible companies as was done in the case of asbestos and tobacco. If timely action is not taken, we caution about the potential rise of climate violence of emerging 'new politics' and increased global population displacement. Science, government, and business sectors need to collaborate in transdisciplinary ways to produce further actionable knowledge. Scientists can lead by example by reducing their own carbon footprints. Social media summary Fund climate action by taxing billionaires, eliminating subsidies, and suing fossil companies for climate homicide. The science community is focused on and committed to systems changes - seeking both natural systems, and social and economic systems to be sustainable. Yet systems that are in-place now producing carbon dioxide (herein aka carbon), are not taking adequate scientifically recommended actions; or worse, they are changing in the wrong directions. How can we move from producing more scientific knowledge to science-based actions, and what can scientists do to support such actions? In this Intelligence Briefing, we suggest some pathways for action.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023. Published by Cambridge University Press."

Biomass is emerging as one of the possible renewable energy resources that may be used to generate energy. Through the proper channels, such as chemical, biochemical, and thermochemical processes, it can be turned into electricity. In the context of India, the potential sources of biomass can be broken down into agricultural waste, tanning waste, sewage, vegetable waste, food, meat waste, and liquor waste. Each form of biomass energy so extracted has advantages and downsides, so determining which one is best is crucial to reaping the most benefits. The selection of biomass conversion methods is especially significant since it requires a careful study of multiple factors, which can be aided by fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) models. This paper proposes the normal wiggly interval-valued hesitant fuzzy-based decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory model (DEMATEL) and the Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment of Evaluations II (PROMETHEE) for assessing the problem of determining a workable biomass production technique. The proposed framework is used to assess the production processes under consideration based on parameters such as fuel cost, technical cost, environmental safety, and CO2 emission levels. Bioethanol has been developed as a viable industrial option due to its low carbon footprint and environmental viability. Furthermore, the superiority of the suggested model is demonstrated by comparing the results to other current methodologies. According to comparative study, the suggested framework might be developed to handle complex scenarios with many variables. © 2023, The Author(s)."

In this study, an environmental impact assessment was performed to identify the environmental burdens associated with the production of plastic trigger sprayers. The environmental impact of the analysed trigger sprayer is mainly determined by the extraction of raw materials, electricity consumption in the production stage and end-of-life treatment of wastes. The application of three improvements to the traditional process leads to a significant decrease in the environmental impact across all the considered impact categories: the benefits mainly arise from the use of renewable electricity and partly from the substitution of virgin material with recycled one. The carbon footprint related to a single plastic sprayer is decreased of around 23% upon the modifications applied to the traditional process, i.e., from 0.099 kg CO2 eq down to 0.077 kg CO2 eq that reported to the annual production of 15 million pieces, would lead to a reduction of around 339 ton CO2 eq released to the atmosphere. The obtained results indicate that to further improve the environmental performance of plastic dispensers (and of plastic objects in general), technologies suitable for the processing and manufacturing of recycled materials should be implemented. This will be achieved only through the improvement of a collection, sorting and recycling system able to provide high-quality secondary materials. Finally, the industrial process should be optimized decreasing the production scrap, using renewable energy sources and promoting its reuse for multiple times. © 2023, The Author(s)."

However, the impact of these factors on CO2-brine two-phase flow for CO2 geological storage is yet to be directly demonstrated. In this study, experiments were conducted on two Berea sandstone cores with an average length of 120 mm and diameter of 38 mm to assess the effect of surfactant pre-injection on the flow of CO2-brine under reservoir conditions at 10 MPa and 40 °C. It was validated that the experimental system could provide reliable results by comparing the baseline relative permeabilities with those presented in the existing literature. It was consistently demonstrated through repeated experiments that a surfactant solution, even when present in low concentration, could enhance CO2 saturation and relative permeability using identical procedures. Specifically, the CO2 relative permeability was increased by at least 56% from the baseline. Additionally, the experiment on the imbibition process showed that surfactant treatment effectively increases residual CO2 saturation. The results support previous numerical analysis and show that surfactant pre-injection could improve injectivity and contribute to a smaller CO2 footprint such that CO2 is prevented from any leakage pathway. © 2023 The Author(s)"

In this work, we develop a miniature wall shear stress sensor consisting of a pair of carbon nanotube pillars that produce a measurable capacitance change when one is deflected by the flow. The sensor, including material producing the capacitance change, has a 50 μm × 60 μm footprint and <200 μm height. It provides 0.05-1 fF/Pa sensitivity with up to ±8 Pa range. Most sensors produced were found to have a wider operating range when the thinner pillar was positioned downstream because greater deflection could be achieved without contact between the pillars. Interestingly, a small number of sensors responded differently to flow due to twisting of the sensing element rather than bending or due to a dominant Bernoulli effect. These diverse sensing mechanisms could be exploited to tune sensitivity or operating range in future designs. © 2023 American Chemical Society."

However, analyzes based on these variables neglect the supply side of environmental sustainability. To address this shortcoming, this study aims to examine the determinants of the ecological footprint pressure index (EFPI) in the context of the EKC hypothesis. The EFPI provides a more detailed picture of environmental issues by considering both ecological footprint and biocapacity. Thus, the study aims to add scientific value to the existing literature by analyzing the EFPI under the EKC hypothesis for the first time. Building on this, our research investigates the effects of economic complexity (ECX), per capita income, and renewable energy consumption (REC) on the EFPI by adopting a novel econometric approach. The results of the Fourier autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) method show a cointegration relationship between income, ECX, renewable energy and EFPI in Germany, Switzerland and Sweden. The long-term elasticities indicate that ECX reduces the EFPI in Germany and Switzerland, while renewable energy mitigates environmental pressure in Switzerland and Sweden. Our findings also confirm the validity of the EKC hypothesis for Germany and Sweden. Based on these findings, the study suggests that ECX, renewable energy and economic growth can all be used as policy instruments to reduce environmental pressure in the three member states of the European Union. © The Author(s) 2022."

The mean values obtained for the CI of PV in buildings in Europe correspond to 36 gCO2-eq/kWh for an optimally oriented rooftop PV installation. For facades, this corresponds to 51.4, 71, and 214 gCO2-eq/kWh, respectively, for S-, W-/E-, and N-facing facades. Notably, the potential to halve these figures by 2030 already exists. These figures are compared with CI mean values for national electricity mixes: 374.5 gCO2-eq/kWh. For most countries, the integration of PV in facades (often including N-facing PV facades) would not penalize—and conversely support—a transition toward a carbon-neutral electricity mix. © 2023 Elsevier Inc."

In stage 1, the programme will be designed using the sustainable diets, behaviour change wheel and capability, opportunity, motivation, and behaviour (COM-B) models. A sustainable food guide, recipes, meal plans and a mobile application will be developed. In stage 2, the intervention will be implemented for 7 weeks, and a 7-week follow-up period in a young Mexican adults (18-35 years) sample, randomly divided (1:1 ratio) into a control group (n 50) and an experimental group (n 50), will be divided into two arms at week 8. Outcomes will include health, nutrition, environment, behaviour and nutritional-sustainable knowledge. Additionally, socio-economics and culture will be considered. Thirteen behavioural objectives will be included using successive approaches in online workshops twice a week. The population will be monitored using the mobile application consisting of behavioural change techniques. In stage 3, the effects of the intervention will be assessed using mixed-effects models on dietary intake and quality, nutritional status, physical activity, metabolic biomarkers (serum glucose and lipid profile), gut microbiota composition and dietary water and carbon footprints of the evaluated population.

First, we report on the recent efficiency improvements of passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC) and tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) cells on 210 mm wafers. At Trina Solar, the best batch average cell efficiency (total area) reached 23.61% for PERC and 25.04% for industrial-TOPCon (i-TOPCon). As far as we know, these are the highest values achieved on 210 mm wafers. The best champion efficiency for PERC and i-TOPCon is 24.5% and 25.42%, respectively, as independently confirmed by the National Institute of Metrology of China in Beijing and ISFH CalTech in Hamelin. We have developed modules with power outputs of up to 660 W by using 66 pieces of these 210 mm cells with 12-busbar technology in mass production. Besides, the aperture efficiency of the best laboratory PERC module fabricated by Trina Solar is 23.03%, which was independently confirmed by TÜV Rheinland. As far as we know, this is the first commercially sized PERC module with an aperture efficiency of 23% and a power output of over 600 W. Second, we have examined the technological development in the PV industry and summarise some empirical results. A look at the historical data shows that an increase in wafer area of at least 50% is required for a wafer size to become a new industry standard that lasts for 10 years. We find that it typically took about 3 years for the average efficiency of a cell in mass production to reach the efficiency of the champion cell produced in the industrial laboratory. We apply the empirical Goetzberger equation to analyse the module efficiency of c-Si and thin-film technologies. Based on our previous work, we update the selling price and manufacturing cost of PV modules and their learning curves. If we restrict the module price learning curve to the years starting in 2015, we find a short-term learning rate (LR) of about 40%, while the overall LR since 1970 is about 24%. A strong LR is driven by collaboration among industrial players and clustering of the industry, as well as standardisation of the technology, the supply chain, and final product design, which lead to fast equipment development and fast increase in capacity of supply chain. We propose an empirical law to describe the recent evolution of equipment LR, which shows that the throughput of tool increases 100% in every 3 years, so that the investment in cell production lines has decreased by 50% every 3 years since 2015. Finally, we quantify the material consumption and carbon footprint of PV plants today and for the expansion of PV to terawatt (TW) levels. Besides replacing silver fingers with copper and aluminium, saving copper cables in utilities and low-carbon mining of materials are the most effective carbon reduction measures in the PV supply chain. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

However, government policy and recent technological innovations do not address the digital carbon footprint of organizations. The paper aims to present the concept of single-use dark data and how knowledge reuse by organizations is a means to digital decarbonization. Design/methodology/approach: Businesses in all sectors must contribute to reducing digital carbon emissions globally, and to the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is the first to examine “how” from a knowledge (re)use perspective. Drawing on insights from the knowledge creation process, the paper presents a set of pathways to greater knowledge reuse for the reduction of organizations’ digital carbon footprint. Findings: Businesses continually collect, process and store knowledge but generally fail to reuse these knowledge assets – referred to as dark data. Consequently, this dark data has a huge impact on energy use and global emissions. This model is the first to show explicit pathways that businesses can follow to sustainable knowledge practices. Practical implications: If businesses are to be proactive in their collective pursuit of net-zero, then it becomes paramount that reducing the digital carbon footprint becomes a key sustainability target. The paper presents how this might be accomplished, offering practical and actionable guidance to businesses for digital decarbonization. Originality/value: Two critical questions are facing businesses: how can decarbonization be achieved? And can it be achieved at a low-cost? Awareness of the damaging impact digitalization may be having on the environment is in its infancy, yet knowledge reuse is a proactive and cost-effective route to reduce carbon emissions, which is explored in the paper. © 2022, Thomas W.

Alternatively, anaerobic ammonia-oxidizing (anammox) bacteria are able to accelerate this treatment by directly converting ammonia to N2 in the presence of nitrite only. However, their growth in mainstream treatment is very slow, which prevents its full-scale implementation. In this study, a new electro-bioreactor was designed to enhance the anammox reaction during wastewater treatment. The proposed reactor configuration, which takes advantage of a low direct current (DC) application, has a smaller footprint with less organic and oxygen requirements. To demonstrate its effectiveness, synthetic wastewater was used to feed a completely mixed continuous flow electro-bioreactor with anammox species and compared to a traditional anammox bioreactor (control). At the same hydraulic retention time (HRT), the electro-bioreactor reached steady-state conditions twice faster (3 months). The results show that the intermittent DC field improved the simultaneous removal of NH4+-N and NO2--N by 90% and 89%, respectively. The system significantly enhanced the key enzyme generation and cellular metabolism involved in the anammox reactions, which subsequently led to superior removal of nitrogen. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed the dominance of anammox microbial population in the electro-bioreactor over denitirifiers despite elevated carbon concentrations. Furthermore, anammox activity was maintained in the electro-bioreactor at low temperatures. The electro-bioreactor offers potential cost-effective large-scale application of the anammox mainstream process for enhanced removal of nitrogen from wastewater in the cold season. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Iranian Society of Environmentalists (IRSEN) and Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University."

Design/methodology/approach: On the basis of field and literature research, the basic framework is built using dynamic life cycle assessment (DLCA), and the gray prediction model is used to predict the future value. Finally, a CFP model covering the whole life cycle has been constructed and applied to a hospital building in China. Findings: The results applied to the case show that the CO2 emission in the operation stage of the hospital building is much higher than that in other stages, and the total CO2 emission in the dynamic and static analysis operation stage accounts for 83.66% and 79.03%, respectively; the difference of annual average emission of CO2 reached 28.33%. The research results show that DLCA is more accurate than traditional static life cycle assessment (LCA) when measuring long-term objects such as carbon emissions in the whole life cycle of hospital building. Originality/value: This research established a carbon emission calculation model that covers the life cycle of hospital building and considered time factor, which enriches the research on carbon emission of hospital building, a special and extensive public building, and dynamically quantifies the resource consumption of hospital building in the life cycle. This paper provided a certain reference for the green design, energy saving, emission reduction and efficient use of hospital building, obviously, the limitation is that this model is only applicable to hospital building. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
882,A novel technique for quantifying the fate of CO2 injected in oil reservoir for geological utilization and storage,Article,Hu T.; Wang Y.; Xu T.; Tian H.; Rui Z.; Zhao Y.; Liu T.,Energy Reports,9.0,2023,5350,5361,10.1016/j.egyr.2023.04.364,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85156138136&doi=10.1016%2fj.egyr.2023.04.364&partnerID=40&md5=b4e9516a88510b3eae053e057acab723,23524847,Scopus,Carbon sequestration; Fate of injected CO<sub>2</sub>; Geochemical kinetics reactions; Inter-well connectivity,"CO2-enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) is a potential CO2 capture, utilization, and storage technology. In particular, CO2 can break the hydrochemical balance of water–rock and converts into carbonate minerals which are the most stable sequestration phase. The water–rock reactions are complex kinetic processes because the rate of dissolution/precipitation of minerals are vary with the pH of the formation water. However, studies on the effect of geochemical reactions on CO2-EOR processes are lacking, and the fate of CO2 cannot be accurately quantified. In this study, we combine the characteristics of the oil phase into the thermal–hydraulic–chemical TOUGHREACT simulator to consider various water–rock geochemical kinetic reactions in CO2-EOR. Therefore, the distribution phase of CO2 can be determined completely in the reservoir. Our analyses use the realistic fluid property (pressure–volume–temperature) of multicomponent oil phase–CO2 mixtures. The model considers the possible geochemical reactions and the resulting changes in porosity and permeability. The results indicate that in gas–water cycle of 9% hydrocarbon pore volume CO2 slug, the largest distributed phase of CO2 is the gas phase, accounting for 52.2% during the CO2 injection period. After water injection, the solubility of CO2 in the oil phase increases, and CO2 is mostly dissolved in the oil phase, accounting for 53.0%. Without considering the water–rock geochemical reactions will result in an underestimation of the dissolved aqueous phase and correspondingly the others were overestimated. The maximum error of the distributed quantity is up to 6.4% of the total injection. In addition, the omission of water–rock reactions result in an underestimation of the oil recovery. Comparing with the CO2 storage in a saline aquifer, dissolution of CO2 in oil phase in CO2-EOR scenario dampens the effect of buoyancy, which leads to higher sequestration capacity for the same footprint of storage reservoir. © 2023 The Author(s)"
883,"Environmental sustainability risk, institutional effectiveness and urbanization",Article,Abaidoo R.; Agyapong E.K.,Energy and Environment,34.0,2023,3055,3079,10.1177/0958305X221118876,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135783516&doi=10.1177%2f0958305X221118876&partnerID=40&md5=8c0267f6a40a5f3236039937f871e3f0,0958305X,Scopus,C51; Codes:; Environmental sustainability risk; institutional effectiveness; political instability; Q3; Q32; Q53; urbanization,"This study examines the effect of urbanization, institutional quality and other variables on environmental sustainability risk among economies in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Environmental sustainability risk is examined from three main perspectives – emission of gases inimical to the environment (CO2 emissions), exploitation of land and water resources (ecological footprint) and exploitation of resources devoid of the requisite savings and education expenditure (genuine sustainability risk). Empirical analyses were performed using the Limited Information Maximum Likelihood (LIML) Instrumental Variable estimation technique. Estimated results suggest that urbanization, population growth and increase commodity prices on the global market (for key export commodities) worsen CO2 emissions among economies in the sub-region. The results further suggest that urbanization, population growth, governance and institutional structures increase resource exploitation. Additional results suggest that institutional quality lessens adverse effect urbanization has on environmental sustainability risk (CO2 emissions) and genuine sustainability risk; but exacerbates the impact urbanization has on ecological footprint. Given these findings, this study recommends conscious efforts at improving governance and institutional structures among governments in the sub-region to lessen adverse effect of urbanization and population growth on environmental sustainability risk. © The Author(s) 2022."

Light-weighting, via material substitution, and the re-designing of components or even a combination of the two, have been identified as a crucial solution. Additive manufacturing (AM) can be used to technologically complement or even replace conventional manufacturing in several industrial fields. The enabling of complexity-for-free (re) designs is inherent in additive manufacturing. It is expected that certain benefits can be achieved from the adoption of re-design techniques, via AM, that rely on topological optimisation, e.g., a reduced use of resources in both the material production and use phases. However, the consequent higher specific energy consumption and the higher embodied impact of feedstock materials could result in unsustainable environmental costs. This paper investigates the case of the light-weighting of an automobile component to quantify the outcomes of the systematic integration of re-designing and material substitution. A bracket, originally cast in iron, has been manufactured by means of a powder bed-based AM technique in AlSi10Mg through an optimized topology. Both manufacturing routes have been evaluated through a comparative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) within cradle-to-grave boundaries. A 69%-lightweighting has been achieved, and the carbon dioxide emissions and energy demands of both scenarios have been compared. Besides the use-phase-related savings in terms of both energy and carbon footprint due to the lightweighting, the results highlight the environmental trade-offs and prompt the consideration of such a manufacturing process as an integral part of sustainable product development. © 2023, The Author(s)."

Carbon emissions and environmental impact have become important factors that must be considered in the supply chain operation process. Among them, supplier selection is the first process in supply chain operation. Although many studies have discussed the related issues of green supplier assessment, the potential risks of some environmental impacts are still not comprehensive enough, plus it is difficult to assess the potential risks of suppliers on the Internet, because the process of text data analysis and evaluation is not only time-consuming and costly, but also unable to obtain the latest supplier risk information on time. This study applies natural language processing(NLP) model and life cycle assessment(LCA) to develop a green supplier risk evaluation system. The potential risk assessment of suppliers can be achieved through the KeyExtractor's keyword extraction method. The main contribution of this study is to develop a novel green supplier evaluation method based on deep learning models to promote the implementation of green procurement and reduce the carbon footprint of suppliers. Practically, the proposed method automates supplier risk assessment, not only can obtain the latest information and trends of supplier risk on time and reduce the time and cost of risk analysis. Hence, the competitiveness of enterprises would be enhanced.  © 2023 The Authors."

This study investigates how the daily operations of food services along Malaysia’s East Coast affect the environment. Food stalls, steamboats, and casual dining restaurants were among the various food service establishments chosen. During an audit of food waste, three categories were identified: Preparation loss (PREP), serving loss (SERVE), and customer’s plate loss (PLATE). The data was acquired by getting a record of water and electricity bills, as well as by weighing the food waste that was generated and recording it in a checklist. The flow process of the generated food waste was analysed and illustrated using Material Flow Analysis (MFA). Food waste was highest over the weekend. The average amount of food wasted per week was highest from PLATE waste at 84.75 kg and lowest from serving loss at 21.68 kg. The steamboat restaurants had the greatest weekly average electricity and water use, with 141.4 kWh and 15.46 kgCO2e of carbon footprint and 13.05 m3 and 5.5 kgCO2e, respectively. Reduced excessive amounts of eating and careful assessment during food preparation are the first two ways to decrease food waste. © UMT Press"

The present study aims to produce sustainable mortar by combining solid waste such as desert sand, stone dust, and crumb rubber to fully replace river sand. In addition, replacing cement with silica fume helps reduce the environmental carbon footprint. The present research prepared three types of mortar mixes: natural dune sand mortar (M1), natural dune sand stone dust crumb rubber mortar (M2), and natural dune sand stone dust crumb rubber silica fume mortar (M3). The developed mortar samples were examined at ambient and elevated temperatures of 100°C, 200°C, and 300°C for 120 minutes. Furthermore, 3 cycles of 12 hours each at freezing temperature (-10° ± 2°C) and crushed ice cooling (0° to-5°C) were also tested. Results of the study showed an increment in compressive strength values in M1, M2, and M3 mortar mixes (up to 200°C). Later, an abrupt drop in the compressive strength was noticed at 300°C in all mixes M1, M2, and M3, respectively. The mix M3 combinations resist heating impacts and perform significantly better than other mixes M1 and M2. Also, M3 combinations resist the cooling effect better than M1 and M2. It can be concluded that the mortar mix M3 with desert sand, stone dust, crumb rubber, and silica fume combination is considered the best mix for both heating and cooling resistance. Hence, the developed sustainable mortar M3 combination can be utilized in all adverse weather conditions. © 2023 by the authors. Licensee C.E.J, Tehran, Iran."

The efficient utilization of biomass energy sources plays an essential role in attaining sustainable development goals, especially among developing economies. This study empirically investigates the ecological footprints, biomass energy demand, and per capita income association for 30 BRI economies from 1995 to 2021. The study incorporates cointegration and panel quantile regression (PQR) to identify the relationship among discussed variables. Empirical outcomes indicate a negative significant biomass energy demand and ecological footprints relationship, especially among the economies with high traits of ecological footprints. Moreover, the empirical findings also confirm the negative significant per capita income and ecological footprints relationship, while the square of per capita income approves a significant positive association with ecological footprints. These estimates confirm the EKC hypothesis among per capita income and ecological footprints. The findings of the current study help to determine the optimum level of modern biomass energy consumption, which helps to attain economic growth without compromising ecological sustainability. © 2023.

As tourism is viewed as one of the essential causes of global warming, policymakers are searching for tools to decrease the carbon footprint of the tourism sector by introducing energy efficiency strategies. This study aims to contribute to the energy-emissions debate by accounting for the presence of the tourism sector. In particular, we offer novel evidence on the effect of renewable energy on CO2 emissions in a sample of 50 most tourism-oriented countries over the period from 2000 to 2015. Using a two-step GMM estimator, we find that a one percent increase in renewable energy consumption leads to a one percent decrease in CO2 emissions. We also confirm the presence of the Environmental Kuznets Curve phenomena in tourism-oriented countries. Based on the empirical findings, the study suggests that the policymakers of the top tourist-oriented countries initiate more renewable energy-based activities to achieve sustainable economic development. © 2023, Econjournals.

Due to their richness in these resources, most economic development and activities, including environmental and economic aspects, depend on and are determined by energy consumption and natural resource rents. However, the increasing dependence of G-7 economies on energy consumption and natural resources raises questions about their long-term growth and ecological policies towards achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). Therefore, the main objective of this study is to examine the influence of natural resources, renewable energy, economic policy uncertainty, human capital, and globalization on the ecological footprint in the panel of G-7 economies from 1990 to 2020. After confirming the cross-sectional dependence issue, this study applied second-generation panel data approaches to estimate robust and reliable outcomes. The estimated evidence from this study discovered that natural resources, globalization processes, and economic policy uncertainty significantly increase the level of ecological footprint in the region. In contrast, renewable energy and human capital provide feasible solutions for ecological improvement in the study area. Likewise, the interactive role of renewable energy with economic policy uncertainty significantly protects the environmental quality in the study area. Based on the estimated findings, this study recommends various achievable policy options for policymakers and the governments of these economies to ensure environmental sustainability. © 2023.

This paper compares the options in a case study. It evaluates a proposal to capture fermentation CO2 from 34 ethanol refineries in 5 U.S. states and build an elaborate pipeline to transport the CO2 to an underground storage site. This “ethanol plan” is compared with building wind farms at the same cost to provide electricity for BEVs (“wind plan A”). Compared with the ethanol plan, wind plan A may reduce 2.4-4 times the CO2, save drivers in the five states $40-$66 billion (USD 2023) over 30 years even when BEVs initially cost $21,700 more than FFVs, require 1/400,000th the land footprint and 1/10th-1/20th the spacing area, and decrease air pollution. Even building wind to replace coal (“wind plan B”) may avoid 1.5-2.5 times the CO2 as the ethanol plan. Thus, ethanol with carbon capture appears to be an opportunity cost that may damage climate and air quality, occupy land, and saddle consumers with high fuel costs for decades. © 2023 American Chemical Society."

Distinguishing itself from prior research, the study employs both carbon emissions and ecological footprint to ensure an intricate and reliable analysis. Current study analyzes data from 1970 to 2022 from South Korea to indicate that energy-environment association is influenced by energy consumption, urbanization, and economic growth, while renewable energy consumption is key in long-term environmental sustainability. Our extensive econometric analysis allows us to suggest that South Korea need to prioritize renewable energy, and green growth is prioritized so that economic growth and green agenda are synchronized to overcome environmental challenges.

The findings of the both time series unit root (with and without structural break) tests confirm that none of a single variable is stationary more than the first difference. Furthermore, the Wald and nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag bound methods check asymmetry and long-term cointegration relationship between the intended variables, respectively. Moreover, this study uses the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag model to estimate the short-run and long-run coefficients/elasticity of the ecological footprint function. Following the empirical evidence, the findings revealed that positive (negative) components in trade diversification curtail the ecological footprint in the long-run. In addition, a positive shock in air transportation leads to an increase in ecological footprint in the long-run. Nevertheless, a negative shock in air transportation exerts a significant and adverse influence on the level of ecological footprint in the long-run. Furthermore, a positive (negative) shock in technological developments significantly reduces environmental pollution in the US economy in the long-run. Besides, the outcomes from economic complexity discovered a positive shock will significantly overcome the pressure on the environment in the long-run. However, in the short-run, it is observed that negative shock in trade diversification will lead to increase the ecological footprint level in USA. Similarly, a positive shock in air transportation will lead to increase the pollution level in the short-run. In contrast, a negative shock in air transportation will lead to reduce the pressure on the environment in the short-run. Besides, in terms of policy realization, the present research recommends adopting trade synchronization, harmonic trade strategies, and investment in technological innovations to diminish the existing level of ecological footprint in the region. For sustainable development, this study put forward for instantaneously encouraging the expansion of the digital economy and reducing air pollution, accelerating the green transformation, and impelling the industrial agglomeration process in the USA. © 2023.

898,Sustainable regional real options value chains: an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cureCadenas de valor de opciones reales regionales sostenibles: una onza de prevención vale una libra de curaCadeias de valor de opções reais regionais sustentáveis: antes prevenir do que remediar,Article,Perez-Batres L.A.; Trevino L.J.,Management Research,21.0,2023,404,418,10.1108/MRJIAM-09-2023-1456,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174581515&doi=10.1108%2fMRJIAM-09-2023-1456&partnerID=40&md5=ea93e94922e8d7ffa6be09d4d06393b1,15365433,Scopus,MNE; Nearshoring; Real options; Value chains,"Purpose: This study aims to offer a value chain (real options) approach for reducing uncertainty exposure by pursuing a global frictionless trade ethos almost exclusively. Jolts of significant proportion, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic and corresponding reshoring phenomena observed in Mexico and Central America, enhance the topic’s relevance. Design/methodology/approach: This conceptual study sheds light on heightened systemic uncertainty because of extreme events; proposes a mitigation protocol rooted in real options (ROs); and prescribes incentivizing regional value chains through public–private partnerships (PPPs). Findings: This study identifies a systemic multinational enterprise (MNE) response aimed at mitigating the repercussions of the most recent jolt of significant worldwide proportions and suggests developing regional value chains through PPPs. In doing so, the authors recognize an incipient MNE trend toward nearshoring and backshoring to achieve this end. This phenomenon is relatively underdeveloped in Europe, where fewer than 4% of firms have engaged in backshoring activities, even in the three-millennia-old Basque region. In contrast, last year’s backshoring of global value chains (GVCs) in Mexico and Central America was noticeable. Research limitations/implications: This study is among the first, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, to explore the nearshoring phenomenon as a response mechanism, and it opens avenues for finding better ways to mitigate worldwide uncertainties and exposure to extreme events. Practical implications: This model would benefit MNEs and governments by keeping their operations running as close to capacity as possible, even when external jolts cause a partial or total system shutdown of MNEs’ GVCs. The proposed solution, namely, PPPs, can achieve these objectives through real options. Social implications: A social benefit of the regionalization of MNEs’ GVCs would be helping to resolve societal grand challenges, including lowering their global carbon footprint and reducing poverty. This is because having a regional supply facility close to their home market would not only lead to cost reductions for MNEs but also allow them to conduct more on-site quality control checks. Originality/value: The regional real options concept offers an excellent opportunity for practitioners and governments to improve MNEs’ success via the mitigation of uncertainties and, concomitantly, the lives of billions of people. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."

The aim of the study was to evaluate the awareness and practice regarding eco-friendly dentistry among private dental practitioners of Mangalore Taluk, South India. Materials and Methods: A total of 104 Dental practitioners with a qualification of BDS/MDS, practicing dentistry were randomly participated in a study after obtaining institutional ethical clearance. A total of 30 item closed-ended self-designed validated questionnaires were provided among participants. Assessment of knowledge and practice of the participants were carried out under four sections 1) Radiographic waste management, 2) Biomedical waste management, 3) Amalgam management, and 4) Eco-friendly dental practice. Knowledge, attitude and practice of eco-friendly dentistry among all the dental practitioners were assessed using descriptive statistics and Fisher’s exact/chi-square test. Results: Present study did not find any statistically significant difference in attitude, knowledge and practice among BDS and MDS dental practitioners, among male and female practitioners and among practitioners with and without 10 years of experience. 57% participants agreed to the fact that lack of awareness is a major barrier to implement eco-friendly dentistry at practice. Conclusion: Conducting CDE programs, workshops, and seminars can bring change and foster a favourable attitude among dentists about transitioning from conventional to green dentistry. Governmental policies can be framed towards eco-friendly dental practice in order to implement green dental practice compulsorily by all the dental practitioners. © 2023, Indian Association of Biomedical Scientists.

This study compares the carbon footprint and economic impact of two common process designs based on enhanced coagulationfiltration with pH, Ca, and alkalinity adjustment for corrosion control. The process designs are direct filtration (DF) using Al coagulant with limewater (DF-Al) and contact filtration (CF) using Fe coagulant with alkaline filter layers (CF-Fe). The operational data are retrieved from full-scale DWTPs. The results show that the carbon footprint from operations is five times larger for the DF-Al compared to the CF-Fe. Operational costs covering chemicals and energy are almost 30% higher for the DF-Al. Simplified material intensity estimations for the construction phase show that the carbon footprint and investment cost increase with increasing process area, which are larger for the DF-Al. Therefore, to reduce environmental impacts and costs, the design of drinking water treatment processes should be carefully considered even for very similar processes. The results should motivate both water professionals and decision-makers to include a carbon footprint evaluation as a routine step in the DWTP selection and design phases. © 2023 The Authors Water Practice & Technology."

As a result, the goal of this paper is to use different machine learning methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayes and K-nearest neighbors) to establish which of these algorithms is the most accurate in predicting the values of Egypt’s renewable energy production on the one hand, and recognizing the main determinants of this renewable energy production on the other. The paper proved that the Gradient Boosting model is the most accurate machine learning method. It also showed that the main determinant of Egypt’s renewable energy production is Governance indicators (60%), then GDP per capita growth by (13%) and Population growth by (10%). As for the rest of the other variables, such as the price of oil, CO2 emissions, Renewable energy technical innovation, Renewable energy adaptation and Energy imports they have no effect. This paper recommends expanding the use of machine learning methods in macroeconomic models. © 2023, Econjournals. All rights reserved."

Accordingly, this will make it quite easy to capture practically pure carbon dioxide for subsequent storage. The study presents numerical investigation of the entrained-flow oxy-gasification processes of pulverized coal in CO2-H2O-O2 environment. A numerical methodology for describing oxy-fuel gasification processes has been developed and tested. A study of the influence of the absorption of gas coefficient on the calculation results was carried out. Studies have been conducted on the effect of the excess oxygen ratio, the oxygen concentration in the blast, and the amount of moisture on the physicochemical processes and the composition of the syngas for the gasifier under consideration. It is shown that increasing the oxygen concentration in the blast allows stabilizing the ignition and combustion of pulverized coal at low excess oxygen ratio. The dependence of the chemical efficiency on the main regime parameters is determined. The results showed that a decrease in the excess oxygen ratio from 0.43 to 0.33 leads to an increase in combustible losses from 0.15 to 45% for this gasifier. In the mode with high fuel conversion in the gasifier, the produced syngas with a caloric value of 9.26 MJ/m3 comprised of CO, 40.3; H2, 32.4; and CO2, 25.5 (vol. % dry). © 2023.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recommends these waterbodies are accounted for in national emission inventories, yet data is extremely limited for irrigated landscapes. To derive a baseline of their greenhouse gas footprint, we investigated 38 irrigation farm dams in horticulture and broadacre cropping in semi-arid NSW, Australia. Dissolved CO2, CH4, and nitrous oxide (N2O) were measured in spring and summer, 2021–2022. While all dams were sources of CH4 to the atmosphere, 52% of irrigation farm dams were sinks for CO2 and 70% were sinks for N2O. Relationships in the linear mixed effect models indicate that CO2 concentrations were primarily driven by dissolved oxygen (DO), ammonium, and sediment carbon content, while N2O concentration was best explained by an interaction between DO and ammonium. Methane concentrations did not display any relationship with typical biological variables and instead were related to soil salinity, trophic status, and size. Carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions were highest in small (< 0.001 km2) dams (305 g CO2-eq m−2 season−1) and in those used for recycling irrigation water (249 g CO2-eq m−2 season−1), with CH4 contributing 70% of average CO2-eq emissions. However, irrigation dams had considerably lower CH4 emissions (mean 40 kg ha−1 yr−1) than the IPCC emission factor (EF) of 183 kg CH4 ha−1 yr−1 for constructed ponds and lower N2O EF of 0.06% than the indirect EF for agricultural surface waters (0.26%). This synoptic survey reveals existing models may be severely overestimating (4–5 times) farm dam CH4 and N2O emissions in semi-arid irrigation areas. Further research is needed to define these artificial waterbodies in emissions accounting. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Adolescence presents a unique time in life to promote sustainable diets. Detailed dietary data are needed to inform public health strategies aiming at improving adolescents’ diet quality and reducing dGHGE. Objective: This study aimed to describe dGHGE in Swedish adolescents’ diets by socio-demographic characteristics, evaluate how food groups contribute to dGHGE, and examine dGHGE in relation to diet quality. Methods: Data come from the national, school-based, cross-sectional dietary survey Riksmaten Adolescents 2016-17 of 3099 females and males attending school grades 5 (11–12 y old), 8 (14–15 y old) and 11 (17–18 y old). Participants completed 2 web-based 24-h recalls and questionnaires on lifestyle factors. dGHGE was estimated based on life cycle assessment data. Diet quality was estimated using NRF11.3 (Nutrient Rich Food Index) and SHEIA15 (Swedish Healthy Eating Index for Adolescents 2015). Results: dGHGE were higher in males than females (medians 4.2 versus 3.8 kg CO2e/10 MJ, P < 0.001). In females, dGHGE were highest in grade 5 (4.0 kg CO2e/10MJ), whereas in males, emissions were highest in grade 11 (4.4 kg CO2e/10MJ), P < 0.001 for the sex/grade interaction. Overweight/obesity was positively associated with CO2e/10MJ, but parental education, birthplace, and degree of urbanization were not. In females, the proportion of dGHGE from animal-based foods was lowest in grade 11, whereas the proportions from plant-based foods and sweet foods/beverages were highest. In males, these proportions were similar across grades. NRF11.3 was not associated with CO2e/10MJ, whereas healthier eating, according to SHEIA15, was inversely associated with CO2e/10MJ. Conclusions: Food choices and dGHGE per calorie differ by sex in adolescents. Thus, intervention strategies to improve dietary sustainability need to be tailored differently to females and males. Diet quality should also be considered when promoting reduced GHGE diets. © 2023 The Author(s)"

Relatively little attention, however, has been paid to assessing the behavioral consequences of such recommendations and their actual environmental effects. To address this research gap, we conducted a comprehensive investigation into the climate change impact of household food and beverage packaging within the context of a living lab. Within this living lab, participating households were divided into two experimental groups and one control group, each keeping a diary of the used food and beverage packaging and receiving information regarding food packaging practices at different intervals. The contributions of the paper are twofold: First, our findings reveal that household food and beverage packaging makes only a marginal contribution (0.3 %) to the overall carbon footprint of the average German household. Second, over the course of the study and after the behavioral interventions, all groups exhibited a consistent reduction in both the quantity of packaging materials and the overall carbon footprint associated with these materials: the two study groups by 33.3 % and 18.9 %, and the control group by 34.9 %. While packaging diaries emerged as a viable method for estimating household packaging usage, a thorough assessment unveiled several sources of uncertainty inherent in the results. Although our study demonstrated a significant reduction in climate change impact during the living lab experiment, the causative link between this reduction and the living lab intervention remains inconclusive. © 2023 Institution of Chemical Engineers"

By modifying BM by ketalization, a stable, neutral liquid we call bio-petroleum (BP) is obtained. In this study, a representative compound of BP, DX (1,2:3,5-di-O-isopropylidene-α-D-xylofuranose) was co-processed with n-hexane(nC6) into biofuel. In the search for a process to deoxygenate the DX and avoid over-cracking, to optimize gas and coke yields using a beta catalyst in a fluidized bed catalytic cracking (FCC) unit at a process temperature of 540 °C, we explored mixing 10–70 wt% DX in nC6, with catalyst/feed ratios from 3 to 6 and feed injection time of 30 versus 60 s. DX was fully converting under all conditions tested, while nC6 conversion decreased, reaching zero conversion when DX > 50 wt%. Coke yield varied from 3 to 9 wt%. The mixture containing a low amount of DX provided hydrocarbons without oxygenates. The mixture of 50% DX in nC6 only gave 2.7 wt% of oxygenates such as furans and ketones. Hence, the results confirmed the strong potential of beta catalysts to produce biofuel, superior to ZSM-5 and Y zeolites. Furthermore, the results of the variations of processing parameters added insights about the bio-petroleum conversion steps, contributing to further catalyst and process development. © 2023"

Short-acting β2-agonist (SABA) overuse (≥ 3 canisters/year) is common in asthma and linked to poor outcomes; however, its environmental impact remains unknown. As part of the CARBON programme, this study retrospectively quantified the carbon footprint of SABA and controller inhalers across all respiratory indications and SABA overuse in asthma in lower-middle-income countries (LMICs), upper-middle-income countries and high-income countries across Africa, Asia Pacific, Latin America and the Middle East. Methods: Two data sources were utilised to evaluate the carbon contribution of inhalers to respiratory care. To quantify greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with total inhaler use across all respiratory indications, inhaler sales data were obtained from IQVIA MIDAS® (Q4/2018–Q3/2019) and compared by dose to prevent confounding from differences in canister actuation counts. GHG emissions associated with SABA overuse in asthma were evaluated using prescription and self-reported over-the-counter purchase data from the SABA use IN Asthma (SABINA) III study (2019–2020). Inhaler-related GHG emissions were quantified using published data and product life cycle assessments. Results: SABA accounted for > 50% of total inhaler use and inhaler-related emissions in most countries analysed. The total SABA-related emissions were estimated at 2.7 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalents, accounting for 70% of total inhaler-related emissions. Among the countries, regions and economies analysed, per capita SABA use and associated emissions were higher in Australia, the Middle East and high-income countries. Most SABA prescriptions for asthma (> 90%) were given to patients already overusing SABA. Conclusions: Globally, SABA use/overuse is widespread and is the greatest contributor to the carbon footprint of respiratory treatment, regardless of the economic status of countries. Implementing evidence-based treatment recommendations, personalising treatment and reducing healthcare inequities, especially in LMICs, may improve disease control and patient outcomes, thereby reducing SABA overuse and associated carbon emissions beyond SABA use alone. © 2023, The Author(s)."

Measures need to be taken to reduce the environmental problems associated with waste glass. Limestone calcined clay cement (LC3) has excellent performance and a low-carbon footprint. However, its environmental benefits still require improvement. This study proposes a strategy to partially replace LC3 with recycled glass powder (RGP) to utilize waste glass while reducing CO2 emissions further. RGP replacement percentages are 10 and 20 %. Experimental studies were systematically conducted to investigate the performance, product composition, and CO2 emission of RGP-LC3. Experimental tests on a macro scale include workability, mechanical properties, and ultrasonic pulse velocity. The composition and microstructure of the material were characterized using thermogravimetric, Fourier-transform infrared, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. The CO2 emissions of LC3 at different stages of its lifecycle were compared and discussed how RGP can reduce these emissions. The results show that RGP helps to increase the workability of the slurry. LC3 containing 10 % RGP showed similar compressive strength to the control group, and 20 % RGP resulted in a decrease in strength. As the replacement percentages increase from 0 to 10 and 20 %, the CO2 emissions per unit volume decrease from 606.46 to 545.14 and 484.43 kg m3/MPa. © 2023 The Authors"

The share of CO2 from cement industry is about 7%. There is a growing need for ways and methods to systematically identify, asses, modify, the cement production process for emission reduction. In line with Egypt commitment to climate change in the COP27, a framework is designed for the assessment of the cement plant. The aim of this paper is to investigate and calculate the CO2 emissions from a building in the New Egyptian Administrative Capital in the area of R5 using ready mix concrete. This study used compiled data of emission factors from Titan Egypt cement plant as the producer of cement in R5. The essential data needed for the calculations were collected from the literature with the guidance of the Intergovernmental Panel of Experts on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, the Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI) of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) as well as the inventory sustainability reports guided by the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA). This is done on two parts: the calculation of CO2 total emissions of the baseline scenario and the second part is a computation of the emissions based on the alternative use of different categories such as raw materials, fuel consumption, energy efficiency, transportation, and water consumption. A comparison between the baseline and the alternative case took place to compute the percentage of reduction in emissions from concrete. The study findings are promising.

910,An LCA answer to the mixed plastics waste dilemma: Energy recovery or chemical recycling?,Article,Arena U.; Parrillo F.; Ardolino F.,Waste Management,171.0,2023,662,675,10.1016/j.wasman.2023.10.011,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174361644&doi=10.1016%2fj.wasman.2023.10.011&partnerID=40&md5=999de4ba9c5830d2d924fe0d2f9277c1,0956053X,Scopus,Life Cycle Assessment; Mixed Plastics Waste; Technological Readiness Level; Waste-to-Chemicals; Waste-to-Energy; Waste-to-Fuel,"The study focuses on mixed plastics waste (MPW), whose complex and unpredictable composition (due to high polymer heterogeneity, additives, and contaminants) makes its valorisation a true technical, environmental, economic, and regulatory challenge. Chemical recycling by means of advanced thermochemical treatments (ATT) could be a successful strategy, able to support the transition from a carbon intensive to a carbon negative sector, and alternative to the current treatments of energy recovery or mechanical downcycling. Some of these ATTs provide an efficient recovery of valuable resources, such as fuels and chemicals, but their role is mainly limited by time necessary to complete the process optimization and implement the required infrastructures. A reliable identification of the best alternatives is thus crucial. A specific LCA approach quantifies the environmental performances of a selected set of ATT technologies for resource recovery from MPW. It includes plastics-to-energy, by combustion or gasification; plastics-to-methane and plastics-to-hydrogen, by gasification; and plastics-to-oil, by thermal pyrolysis. The results highlight the crucial role of carbon capture and storage (CCS) units, which partially reduces that of the specific thermochemical treatment. The best performances, particularly for Climate Change category, are those of the MPW-to-hydrogen by gasification, followed by those of MPW-to-energy by combustion or gasification, all equipped with CCS. The sensitivity analysis considers the evolution of the European energy mix, characterised by a larger utilisation of renewable energy sources, and highlights the corresponding increased sustainability of chemical recycling by ATTs. This suggests that the MPW dilemma should be definitively solved in a close future. © 2023 The Authors"

Both biomass conversion by BSF larvae and associated GHG and NH3 emissions can depend on substrate properties that may be optimized through microbial inoculation pre-treatments, such as bokashi fermentation. Here, we quantified the effects of bokashi fermentation of brewery's spent grains on BSF rearing metrics and associated GHG and NH3 emissions at benchtop scale. We found that bokashi fermentation increased larval biomass by 40% and shortened development time by over two days on average, compared with unfermented spent grains. In line with increased larval growth, CO2 emissions in BSF larvae treatments were 31.0 and 79.0% higher in the bokashi fermented spent grains and Gainesville substrates, respectively, compared to the unfermented spent grains. Adding BSF larvae to the spent grains increased cumulative N2O emissions up to 64.0 mg N2O kg substratedry-1 but there were essentially no N2O emissions when larvae were added to fermented spent grains. Bokashi fermentation also reduced NH3 fluxes from the volatilization of substrate nitrogen in the BSF larvae treatment by 83.7-85.8% during days 7 and 9, possibly by increasing N assimilation by larvae or by reducing the transformation of substrate NH4+ to NH3. Therefore, bokashi fermentation may be applied to improve performance of BSF larvae on a common industrial waste stream and reduce associated emissions. © 2023 The Authors"

The aim of the research project presented below is to develop five building envelope systems made of low-carbon steel and innovative use of wood fibre insulation. Three sandwich panels (pitched roof, flat roof, façade), a double-skin façade and a façade cladding (cassettes) will be developed. The project includes a series of tests to investigate all relevant properties of the systems: load-bearing behavior, fire behavior, thermal insulation, acoustics, air-, water- and vapor-permeability. In addition, two full-scale prototypes were built to study the behavior of the systems under real conditions. The determination of LCA indicators and a comparison in terms of carbon footprint (GWP) with conventional systems using an existing office building as a reference will also be carried out. An economic comparison between the expected delivery and installation price of the five innovative systems and that of the existing conventional systems is planned.

Molecular subtyping has provided valuable insights for treatment decisions, but challenges remain in adjuvant treatment for hormone receptor (HR)-positive/HER2-negative luminal BC (LBC). Multigene markers like Oncotype DX have emerged to provide more precise prognostic information. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of gene expression panels on fear of cancer recurrence (FCR), quality of life (QoL), and healthcare-related greenhouse emissions. Patients and Methods: A monocentric retrospective analysis was conducted using a prospective database of patients undergoing Oncotype DX. QoL assessments were performed using the Short Breast Health Perception Questionnaire (BHPQ) and Life Satisfaction Questionnaire (LSQ-32). Reductions in hospital visits and travel distance were analyzed. Results: Twenty-eight patients underwent Oncotype DX testing. Of these, 17.85% received adjuvant chemotherapy based on the recurrence score (RS). The implementation of Oncotype DX resulted in a significant reduction in hospital visits, travel distance, and healthcare-related greenhouse gas emissions. QoL assessments using BHPQ and LSQ-32 showed lower levels of FCR and improved QoL in various domains for patients who received hormone therapy (HT) alone. Conclusion: The implementation of Oncotype DX in clinical practice has the potential to reduce overtreatment, decrease healthcare-related greenhouse gas emissions, and improve QoL. Lower levels of FCR and improved QoL were observed in patients who received HT-only based on the RS score. © 2023 International Institute of Anticancer Research. All rights reserved."

As an emerging economy, pursuing economic expansion is paramount, requiring significant amount of energy and a degree of openness to other nations. Meanwhile, the nation’s energy demands are heavily met by the usage of biomass and coal energy sources. Furthermore, the nation is part of the top consumer of biomass and coal energy globally. However, over the last 50 years, the level of ecological footprint in India has surged by about 82%, despite the country’s commitment to achieving environmental sustainability, which tends to raise concerns such as: What is the role of India’s major energy sources, biomass, and coal energy, towards ecological sustainability? Does economic globalization promote and hinder India’s environmental sustainability goals? As a result, this current study offers answers to these concerns by investigating the effect of economic globalization, coal energy, and biomass energy on the ecological footprint in India while controlling economic growth. Using the dynamic ARDL to analyze the dataset from 1970 to 2018, the result suggests that biomass energy and economic globalization improve ecological quality. However, economic growth and coal energy impede ecological quality in India. Furthermore, we adopted the time-varying causality test solely to understand the causality analysis, which established that economic globalization, biomass energy, economic growth, and coal energy could forecast the future direction of the ecological footprint. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

However, the nature of this relationship has diverse opinions across the continuum. The present study focuses on the empirical relevance of this debate based on the theoretical underpinnings of ecofeminism and techno-centrism, using panel data on 37 OECD countries for the period 1990-2019. Employing the Pooled Mean Group (PMG) approach, the study constructs two models, based on ecofeminism and techno-centrism, respectively, and finds that both have a negative and significant impact on environmental degradation measured by the ecological footprint. The results suggest that equality of women in the labour markets and technological innovation through R&D expenditure are both viable developmental tools for ensuring environmental sustainability. Moreover, the empirical estimation also confirms the existence of an N-shaped environmental Kuznets curve between economic growth and environmental degradation in the case of selected OECD countries in both ecofeminist and techno-centric models. © 2023.

Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to improve fossil fuel energy efficiency in order to facilitate the shift towards a sustainable energy system with reduced greenhouse gas emissions. This paper employs a slacks-based measure network data envelopment analysis model with undesirable outputs to assess the efficiencies of fossil fuel energy in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries during a span of seven years, specifically from 2015 to 2021. The inclusion of undesirable outputs in this study is important because it allows for a more realistic assessment of efficiency by considering factors like CO2 emissions, which are undesirable outcomes associated with fossil fuel use. The datasets utilised in this study are sourced from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the open data website of Our World in Data. Based on the findings, it can be observed that Singapore and the Philippines have demonstrated outstanding performance in maximising the utilisation of fossil fuels. In contrast, Myanmar exhibits the lowest level of efficiency in this analysis. By identifying top-performing countries in terms of fossil fuel efficiency, it is possible to implement measures to boost efficiency in under-performing countries. This can be achieved through the promotion and adoption of cleaner energy alternatives, specifically renewable energy sources that exhibit a low or negligible carbon footprint. These findings offer significant contributions to policymakers exploring sustainable energy usage, environmental stewardship, and the formulation and execution of comprehensive strategies that aim to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions arising from the consumption of fossil fuels in the ASEAN region. © 2023.The Author(s).

Data suggest that it is possible to improve these both footprints simultaneously, but their potential conflicts and trade-offs have not been systematically explored. To this end, we here used a compromise programming approach to identify the dietary changes required to improve one and/or the other of these footprints, while ensuring nutritional adequacy and adherence to dietary guidelines, using French data on food consumption (1456 adults aged 18–64 years from the INCA 3 study) and food environmental impact (Agribalyse® database). A full range of scenarios was identified by prioritizing the two objectives differently, giving weight from 0 % to 100 %, by 5-% steps, to the improvement in greenhouse gas emissions (GHGe) over the improvement in blue water use (BWU). Overall, we have shown that it is possible to significantly reduce both BWU and GHGe compared to observed levels. The BWU reduction ranged from 14 % to 36 % with increasing prioritization, while the simultaneous GHGe reduction varied less, from 52 % to 44 % with decreasing prioritization. The consumption of some foods varied according to the priority given to BWU over GHGe reduction (namely, vegetables, fruit juice, dairy products, eggs, refined cereal, substitutes, offal and potatoes). In contrast, meat consumption (beef, pork, poultry and processed meat) was systematically removed, while the consumptions of offal and dairy products remained moderate in order to meet nutrient reference values. Fish, whole grains, and fruit also remained relatively constant across scenarios due to the constraints based on dietary guidelines. Whatever the scenario, the modeled diets were more plant-based than the observed diet from which they differed significantly (only 23–31 % of common food consumptions), and were therefore healthier (63–76 % reduction in the distance to theoretical minimum risk of chronic diseases). To conclude, while focusing solely on BWU reduction induces a joint GHGe reduction that is near-maximal, the reverse is not true, showing that there is good alignment but also some divergence between these objectives. © 2023"

Reducing carbon emissions is crucial in attaining environmental sustainability and addressing the consequences of SDG 13 (climate actions). The G7 nations, representing some of the largest economies globally and significantly contributing to global carbon emissions, have achieved certain advancements in mitigating their carbon footprint. Nevertheless, the attainment of carbon neutrality continues to pose a substantial obstacle. This study examines the mechanisms leading to environmental sustainability in G7 economies, explicitly emphasizing the contribution of research and development (R&D) toward attaining carbon neutrality. The present study utilizes G7 data from 1990 to 2020 to conduct an empirical analysis employing a cross-sectional autoregressive distributed lag (CSARDL) panel model. The primary objective of this investigation is to examine the influence of R&D expenditure (R&DE) on carbon emissions metric ton (CO2Mt). Furthermore, this study investigates the current state of the EKC in the economies of the G7 nations, as well as the influence of renewable energy (RE) and non-renewable energy (NRE) on CO2Mt. The results suggest that R&DE is critical in mitigating CO2Mt and attaining carbon neutrality. The study also validates the EKC implies a negative and non-linear relationship between growth and CO2Mt. Moreover, renewable and non-renewable energy validate their respective negative and positive effects on CO2Mt. The findings of our study offer valuable insights for policymakers in the G7 nations, aiding them in developing effective regulatory measures for achieving carbon neutrality goals. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Therefore, there is a need to develop achievable and realistic policies for such technologies to ease the decision-making on national energy strategies. Several countries are starting to develop large-scale green hydrogen production projects to reduce the carbon footprint of the multiple sectors within the country. The conversion sectors, namely power and refinery, are fundamental sectors to decarbonise due to their energy supply role. Nowadays, the highest energy consumables of the country are hydrocarbons (more than 90%) causing a particular challenge for deep decarbonisation. The purpose of this study is to use a multi-regional energy system model of Mexico to analyse a decarbonisation scenario in line with the latest National Energy System Development Program. Results show that if the country wants to succeed in reducing 22% of its GHG emissions and 51% of its short-lived climate pollutants emissions, green hydrogen could play a role in power generation in regions with higher energy demand growth rates. These results show, regarding the power sector, that H2 could represent 13.8 GW or 5.1% of the total installed capacity by 2050, while for the refinery sector H2 could reach a capacity of 157 PJ/y, which is around 31.8% of the total share, and it is mainly driven by the increasing demands of the transport, industry, and power sectors. Nevertheless, as oil would still represent the largest energy commodity, CCS technologies would have to be deployed for new and retrofitted refinery facilities. © 2023 The Authors"

Cloud computing is improving, and data centers are increasing at regular frequencies to meet the demands of users. On the other hand, cloud providers pose major environmental risks because massive data centers use a large amount of energy and leave a carbon footprint. One possible solution to this issue is the use of green cloud computing. However, clients face significant difficulties in adopting green cloud computing. This study aims to understand the problems faced by client organizations while considering green cloud computing. In addition, this study aims to empirically identify the solution to the challenges faced by green cloud computing practitioners. A questionnaire survey approach was used to get insight into green cloud computing practitioners concerning the challenges they faced and their solutions. Data were obtained from sixty-nine professionals in green cloud computing. The results revealed that “lack of quality of service”, “lack of dynamic response”, and “lack of services to satisfy client’s requirements” are critical for green cloud computing. In addition, sixty-three practices for addressing the challenges in green cloud computing are also identified. The identified challenges and practices of green cloud computing will benefit the client organizations to update and revise their process to consider green cloud computing. In addition, it will also assist vendor organizations in developing, planning, and managing systems concerning client satisfaction. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature."

We use data from Swedish users of a carbon calculator that includes weekly estimates of users’ consumption-based carbon-equivalent emissions based on detailed financial statements, official registers, and self-reported lifestyle factors. The calculator is designed to induce behavioral change and gives users detailed information about their footprint. By using a robust difference-in-differences analysis with staggered adoption of the calculator, we estimate that users decrease their carbon footprint by around 10% in the first few weeks, but over the next few weeks, the reduction fades. Further analysis suggests that the carbon footprint reduction is driven by a combination of a shift from high- to low-emitting consumption categories and a temporary decrease in overall spending, and not by changes in any specific consumption category. © 2023, The Author(s)."

This promotes bio-circularity and lowers the carbon footprint. To convert lignocellulosic biomass to more value-added materials, pretreatments are necessary. In this study, annually abundant banana pseudostem agro-residues were hydrothermally pretreated to obtain long banana cellulosic fibers. Natural seawater without extra chemicals was used as the pretreatment media at temperatures and retention times varied from 120 to 130 °C, and 15–45 min respectively. From the results, seawater and distilled water media pretreated fibers noted 15% and 11% higher optimum crystallinity index at 125 °C and 130 °C for 45 min respectively, compared to untreated fibers. Under severe pretreatment conditions, the cellulosic fibers surfaces were distorted, presented voids, and pseudo-lignin particle-sized deposits. At 130 °C for 15 min under seawater media, optimum cellulose content of 67.04 wt%, a tensile strength of 529 MPa, and Young’s modulus of 21 GPa were recorded. Meanwhile, under distilled water media, the maximum cellulose content of 67.17 wt%, a tensile strength of 458 MPa, and Young’s modulus of 22 GPa were noted at 120 °C for 30 min. Compared to untreated and distilled water media pretreated fibers, seawater media pretreated fibers exhibited higher tensile strength and crystallinity index. Thus, this suggests that seawater hydrothermal pretreatment avails an eco-friendly alternative, reduces freshwater footprint and equipment corrosion compared to acidic or alkaline pretreatments.

The reduction of the agricultural carbon footprint requires the development of agroecological practices and eco-friendly processes for biomass and by-products transformation. The push towards decarbonization of several industrial sector brings about new demand for bio-based products and can constitute an opportunity for crop diversification and by-products valorisation for crop fertilization and protection. This evolution leads to the study of novel agricultural systems centered around the concept of circular bioeconomy and the development of transdisciplinary approaches combining agroecology and bioeconomy to create more resilient. But what are these approaches and which steps must be taken to transform agricultural systems toward the ultimate goal of sustainability? Methods: This opinion paper synthesizes such recent advances and contemporary understanding of agroecology and bioeconomy synergies by focusing on 1) the agroecological solutions for the bioeconomy: the ecological role of crop diversification, 2) the main eco-technologies of waste recycling and biomass transformation for agroecological development, 3) a holistic approach of combinations of agroecology and bioeconomy for sustainable agricultural systems. Results: This combination is based on the association of functional low- and high-tech innovations that require life cycle analysis and a multi-assessment in cropping and farming systems to decrease their energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Conclusion: The combination of agroecology and circular bioeconomy constitutes an important lever to mobilize in order to improve ecosystem services at the soil–plant-atmosphere interface and farming sustainability at the territorial scale. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Fossil fuels material footprint (FFMF) remains a critical indicator of environment-friendly economic development. Fossil fuels have also retained their dominance as prominent drivers of global growth since the Industrial Revolution. FFMF levels show considerable variations in economic growth worldwide as awareness of sustainability and climate change propagates. Although biomass/carbon emission convergence have been discussed extensively in the existing literature, FFMF convergence is still scanty despite its vital role in climate change. Hence, this study adds to the existing literature by examining the convergence of FFMF for 154 countries for the period from 1970 to 2019 using club convergence analysis. The results show that FFMF converges to a single steady state, stating a symmetric decline in FFMF growth. Further, the findings from sigma and beta tests are consistent with the main results. Thus, the demonstrated convergence of FFMF directs that global efforts regarding FFMF control should be continued. Moreover, future climate change policies should also be formulated to enhance the awareness of FFMF and long-term sustainability. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

In alignment with the European Commission’s sustainability objectives and U.N. Sustainable Development Goal 12.3, this study explores the potential energy and environmental footprint savings achievable by halving FLW in Europe by 2030. Using a multiregional input-output model, we estimated the total global energy and environmental footprint savings across all stages of the food supply chain, considering industry-specific FLW rates and proportion weights. The findings reveal substantial environmental savings across Europe, with aggregate savings potentially reaching 51 Mt CO2e (0.09 t CO2e/p), 4,620 Mm3 (8 m3/p) of blue water, 106,446 km2 (179 m2/p) of cropland, 55,523 km2 (93 m2/p) of grassland, and 0.47 EJ (0.54 TJ/p) of energy. The greatest potential for savings was found in Western Europe, specifically in France, Germany, Belgium, and The Netherlands. However, countries with a lower per capita GDP, such as Greece, Croatia, Bulgaria, and Romania, also demonstrate significant per capita savings potential, indicating that wealth does not necessarily correlate with higher environmental savings. Agricultural production emerged as the stage with the highest footprint reduction potential for GHG and resource footprints across Europe, while the foodservice and institutional stages offer the greatest energy-saving potential. Geographical disparities underscore the need for region-specific policies. These results challenge the wealth-sustainability correlation and advocate for adaptable policies that transcend national wealth and accommodate regional disparities, underlining the pivotal roles of the agricultural production and consumption stages in footprint savings. © 2023 The Authors.

Smart cities actively attempt to adopt sustainable practices for reducing carbon footprints and improving people's lives. Developing countries like India intensely concentrate on the zero-carbon theme and promote measures to expedite the process. Mayor's transport strategy 2018 is a useful document that describes different zero-carbon measures that smart cities could adopt to promote sustainable transport. Due to the heterogeneity of these measures, ranking becomes essential. Driven by the claim, in this article, we develop a new framework using q-rung fuzzy information (qRFI) for rational ranking of zero-carbon measures. QRFI reduces subjective randomness and allows uncertainty modeling from three dimensions: 1) membership; 2) hesitancy; and 3) nonmembership. Specifically, the framework presents criteria importance through intercriteria correlation (CRITIC) with the rank sum (RS) and measurement of alternatives and ranking based on compromise solution (MARCOS) methods for ranking zero-carbon measures. Some notable innovative aspects are: 1) both subjective and objective weights are calculated for criteria; 2) experts' weights are derived methodically; and 3) zero-carbon measures are ranked with close resemblance to human-driven decisions. To exemplify the usefulness of the proposed tool, a real case example of ranking zero-carbon measures for Coimbatore is demonstrated. Advantages of the innovations are: 1) methodical calculation of weights mitigates biases and inaccuracies; 2) consideration of subjective/objective weights gives better expressibility and understanding of criteria importance; and 3) distance-based human-driven decision scheme offers a flexible and rational ranking. Concerning the findings, the technical aspect criterion receives the highest weight value of 0.1404, followed by documentation (0.1173) and modality shift (0.1125) criteria. Moreover, 'start zero-carbon zones,' incentive-based ultralow-carbon vehicles,' and 'reduced emissions from on-road machinery' are measures that can be implemented to achieve zero-carbon emissions. The strengths and weaknesses of the tool are inferred via sensitivity and comparison checks.  © 2023 IEEE."

The agricultural area dedicated to cocoa represents the largest area dedicated to a permanent crop the country. Dry bean production has grown at an average annual rate of 15% since 2014, mainly due to yield improvements and replacement of other crops. Several varieties of cocoa are grown, but production is dominated by two main varieties: “Cacao Fino y de Aroma” and clonal varieties (dominated by CCN-51). Cocoa, mainly in monocrop systems, is mainly produced on the Ecuadorian Coast (but also in the Highlands and Amazonia). This study presents a statistics-based LCA of the Ecuadorian cocoa value chain. Material and methods: LCIs representing the various types of systems in each link of the value chain—i.e. the various types of farming systems, processing and distribution—were constructed in terms of representative production units. Sub-chains centred on different cocoa varieties and value-adding strategies were identified. Primary and secondary data were collected for the most representative system types, as defined in the actor typologies. Primary data were obtained via field visits and surveys, while secondary data were obtained mainly from statistical datasets of the National Institute of Statistics and Census. Impacts were computed following the European Commission's Product Environmental Footprint, while soil carbon turnover was modelled using RothC. Results and discussion: Identified types of producers are subsistence and entrepreneurial small, medium, and large. Two post-harvest strategies were modelled: a volume-oriented one and a quality-oriented one. The main sub-chains identified are the volume/commodity-oriented one (which is dominantly based on cocoa which either does not undergo post-harvest, or which undergoes volume-oriented post-harvest activities) and the quality-oriented one. Across producer types, irrigation and negative direct field emissions are the most important factors, followed in importance by total energy consumption. Post-harvest and processing activities are dominated by energy expenditures. Sub-chains feature significantly different intensity of impacts, with the volume-oriented sub-chain (i.e. those privileging quantity over quality) featuring lower impacts than the quality-oriented ones. Conclusions: The impacts of the value chain are comparatively lower, at least regarding climate change, than in other producing countries. Its agricultural phase generally exhibits low input pressure, contributes to climate change mitigation through high C sequestration in biomass that exceeds C losses due to land use change (e.g. deforestation), and does not seem to pose an immediate threat to biodiversity. Improvement initiatives do not necessarily imply intensification of production. © 2023, The Author(s)."

Low-carbon transition should preferably lead to a convergence of both equity and mitigation targets among cities. Inter-city supply chains that link the production and consumption of cities are a factor in shaping inequality and mitigation but less considered aggregately. Here, we modelled supply chains of 309 Chinese cities for 2012 to quantify carbon footprint inequality, as well as explored a leverage opportunity to achieve an inclusive low-carbon transition. We revealed significant carbon inequalities: the 10 richest cities in China have per capita carbon footprints comparable to the US level, while half of the Chinese cities sit below the global average. Inter-city supply chains in China, which are associated with 80% of carbon emissions, imply substantial carbon leakage risks and also contribute to socioeconomic disparities. However, the significant carbon inequality implies a leveraging opportunity that substantial mitigation can be achieved by 32 super-emitting cities. If the super-emitting cities adopt their differentiated mitigation pathway based on affluence, industrial structure, and role of supply chains, up to 1.4 Gt carbon quota can be created, raising 30% of the projected carbon quota to carbon peak. The additional carbon quota allows the average living standard of the other 60% of Chinese people to reach an upper-middle-income level, highlighting collaborative mechanism at the city level has a great potential to lead to a convergence of both equity and mitigation targets. © 2023 Science China Press"

This work therefore aims to assess the environmental, economic and nutritional quality dimensions of the menus consumed across the Local Network of School Canteens in the municipality of Ames (Galicia, Spain). It additionally performs different scenarios to evaluate the effects on the environment-cost-nutritional quality trilemma of implementing two major dietary changes in these menus: introducing more organic products, and shifting toward a more plant-based consumption pattern. To this end, this study considers the following indicators: a) those obtained from an energy and carbon life cycle assessment of the school menus (cradle-to-grave approach), mainly the cumulative energy demand (CED) and the carbon footprint (CF), complemented by some energy efficiency indicators; b) the total cost (TC) of the menus, obtained from their life cycle cost assessment (cradle-to-fork approach); and c) the nutritional quality of the menus, calculated and assessed based on the nutrient rich diet index (NRD 9.3). The CED, CF, TC, and NRD 9.3 index of a daily meal at school canteens are, respectively, estimated at 18.87 MJ, 1.30 kg CO2-eq, EUR 4.65, and 278 per meal. The consumption of animal products and labor (for food preparation) are identified, respectively, as the main environmental impact and economic cost of the menus. The results of our research show how implementing changes in consumption habits toward a more vegetarian diet in school menus makes it possible to include organic products to generate the most positive effects in terms of the environment and nutrition without incurring in cost overruns. Our work discusses the main barriers to be overcome and the political actions that must be enforced to advance the procurement of more sustainable and healthy public food.

It calls for a decisive change in food consumption patterns by offering nutritionally adequate, acceptable, affordable, and environmentally friendly menus in massive food services. Therefore, the research question can be defined as: Are there menus considering several servings, nutritionally adequate, acceptable, affordable, and environmentally friendly? Methods: To address this problem, we focus on the dilemma between minimizing the equivalent carbon dioxide (CO2 eq) emitted in the entire production process of a menu, the monthly acquisition cost, and the selection of the most nutritionally adequate menu possible. Specifically, we formulated three multi-objective quadratic mixed integer programming (QMIP) models: (i) minimization of CO2 eq emissions and the selection of the most nutritionally adequate menu possible, (ii) minimization of the monthly acquisition cost of the system and the selection of the most nutritionally adequate menu possible, and (iii) the weighting of CO2 eq emissions, the monthly acquisition cost, and the selection of the most nutritionally adequate menu possible. All are subject to the same nutritional constraints, operational requirements, and cultural acceptability. Chile is the case study to illustrate the proposal’s usefulness, which is one of the wealthiest countries in the Global South with the highest prevalence of overweight. In addition, Chile has addressed various international initiatives, where greenhouse gas reduction is one of the most important commitments. Consequently, alternatives to change food consumption patterns are required. We selected a prestigious Chilean public university in Santiago, which houses all the communities on a single campus. The university offers a daily lunch menu consisting of a starter, main dish, and dessert, considering a set of nutritional aspects: proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, saturated fatty acids, fiber, cholesterol, sodium, and calories. Results: As a result of the 6-month optimization, minimizing acquisition costs proposes cheaper menus with higher CO2 eq emissions than those proposed by the emission minimization. However, when both objective functions are weighted by 50%, results reach saved costs equivalent to 53,030 USD and emission reduction by around 94,900 kg CO2 eq in the 6 months, compared to the data the menus delivered by the university. Conclusions: It shows that, despite assessing conflicting objectives, it is possible to design nutritionally adequate, acceptable, affordable, and environmentally friendly menus for the case study presented. Future research considers solution approaches for multi-objective optimization as genetic algorithms and includes maximizing the number of servings to deliver. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

With the recent drive by the Chinese government to achieve low carbon emissions and further reduce greenhouse gases, this study adds to the existing literature by combining the quantile-on-quantile (QQ) regression and non-parametric techniques to examine the role of economic complexity, nonrenewables energy and renewable energy consumption on the ecological footprint in China over the period 1985Q1–2019Q4. Overall, results show that renewable energy, non-renewable energy use, economic growth and economic complexity affects ecological footprint positively. In addition, the nonparametric causality outcomes revealed that renewable energy, non-renewable energy use, economic growth and economic complexity can significantly predict variations in ecological footprint at different quantiles. We are of the opinion that policymakers in this region should work on the pro-growth mentality of China, which is majorly fossil fuel-driven. This requires an immediate replacement with more eco-friendly sources and energy-saving technologies for economic activities. Otherwise, fulfilling the SDG 13 goals in China will be challenging. For a sustainable renewable energy investment, China should shift to ancillary and spot markets, where the low energy storage and low marginal cost of renewable energy could facilitate higher reduction in electricity cost and encourage higher trading of electricity. © The Author(s) 2022."

This study outlines the knowledge status of this complex challenge via a systematic literature review (SLR). The SLR found 133 of 1570 screened publications that covered relevant frameworks for choosing hospital equipment (i.e., related economics, life cycle assessment, waste generation and health issues). Yet, just five publications addressed choosing single-use vs. reuse of tubes or similar types of equipment by economic and environmental considerations through a systematic quantitative approach. The SLR reveals few publicly available peer-reviewed studies for the optimal sustainable choice of equipment. This study assesses environmental impacts of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions as CO2-equivalents and resource consumption of a single-use double-lumen tube (DLT) combined with a reusable bronchoscope were compared to a single-use DLT with an integrated single-use camera. Camera DLTs exclude or minimize the need for a bronchoscope to verify correct tube placement during one-lung ventilation. The life cycle assessment shows that the materials and energy used and needed for personnel protective equipment and cleaning of the reusable bronchoscope contribute significantly to CO2-equivalent emissions. To ensure the sustainable choice of equipment this aspect must not be overlooked. Secondly, future reuse of plastic waste materials from the use can contribute significantly to better environmental performance. © 2022, The Author(s)."

One of the common challenges in the casting process of such large-scale components is manufacturing defects. However, repair welding will induce residual stress which can initiate cracks in the repaired structure, especially since cast iron is not as tough as steel. The current study addresses developing a thermo-mechanical model of the cast iron repair weld validated with experiments to predict thermal and residual stresses and to identify critical locations for crack initiation. A thermo-mechanical weld model is developed, and the predicted temperature and residual stress distribution are validated against experimental data. Two repair weld experiments, one manual and one automated are carried out and are simulated using the developed thermo-mechanical model. The regions with maximum principal residual stresses are calculated by the thermo-mechanical model and the maximum principal stress method is used to predict the location and direction of the developed cracks in the repair weld. A comparison with the repair weld experiments shows good correlation with the observed cracks in the welded specimens. The outcome of this research provides a basis for repair weld optimization of large-scale cast iron components in order to reduce the carbon footprint caused by their reproduction. © 2023 The Authors"

In the study, multi-energy complementarity is considered, based on demand response, and a Multi-energy Complementation (MEC) optimal dispatch model is established based on Conditional value at risk (CVaR), and finally the energy system optimal dispatch test simulation evaluation under different circumstances is carried out. The simulation results show that the MEC comprehensive energy optimal dispatching system proposed in the study takes the demand side response into account, and the WP energy utilization of the system is more reasonable. When the demand side response is fully considered, the highest load value is 574.12 kW. After considering the demand side response and carbon emission, the average daily carbon emission of the system is only 59.36 kg. When the demand side response and carbon footprint are not considered, the carbon footprint of the gas-fired boiler in the system is always maintained at 32.31 kg, and the carbon emission is small. The comparison of the energy optimal dispatching system shows that the system cost proposed by the research is only 8880.93 yuan; the carbon emission cost is only 417.83 yuan, significantly lower than other systems. The above results show that, after considering the demand side response, the MEC comprehensive energy in the park can be more effectively optimized and the load distribution of the system can be improved, which is of great significance in power grid dispatching. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

Challenges of native host production systems such as excessive land use, large carbon footprints, long production times, and high production costs often make plant-based production of these critical metabolites inefficient and unsustainable. Engineered production through microbial-based synthetic biology offers an alternative method of producing plant compounds that addresses the limitations encountered in plant-based production. New technological and analytical tools such as bioprospecting, machine learning, and protein modeling can be used to explore biodiversity-based data to identify more efficient enzymatic sequences for optimizing the production of plant derivatives. Ex planta production using microbial chassis systems provides a flexible, scalable metabolic platform that can more readily integrate new metabolic processes. Potential improvements include increased production rates and enhanced bioavailability of critical compounds, expanding the frontiers of metabolite production for optimized clinical applications. Microbial-based synthetic biology also opens an avenue for sustainable production, with the capability of modifying the microbial chassis to accommodate a wide variety of substrates for feedstock. It includes the utilization of waste from human activities as carbon sources for production, presenting an opportunity to use cheap renewable resources for greener production methods. The benefits of ex planta production systems can potentially enable the efficient, scalable, and sustainable production of plant derivatives that may vastly improve health and help bring forward the realization of the 2030 UN Sustainable Development Goals. © 2023 The Authors.

However, the ASHP energy performance deteriorates under severe conditions around a building. Researchers have conducted studies for optimal compressor control to overcome these limitations. Despite these efforts, users can seldom perform the optimal regulation of heat pump systems because manufacturers are reluctant to relinquish control to them. Therefore, we developed an artificial neural network (ANN)-based optimum control logic (OCL) system such that users can directly control and optimize heat pump systems without a compressor. The developed ANN-based OCL controls the secondary-side working fluid of the heat pump considering general building conditions, and its practical applicability has been verified using dynamic simulation. The improvement in the energy performance of the optimum models with respect to the conventional models was: 1.52% and 3.58% for the cooling and heating system COP, respectively, and 0.76% and 0.81% for the heat pump COP. These results demonstrate the potential for reduction in the carbon footprint of a building while maintaining comfort by enabling the energy-efficient operation and stable load response of the heating and cooling system. © 2023 The Authors"

This low economic gain impedes the sustainable growth of China’s WEEE-recycling sector and also adds to the government’s financial burden. Prior life-cycle studies have approved the carbon reduction potentials or net carbon credit of recycling WEEE. However, policymakers fail to know whether the revenue from selling carbon credits can offset the government’s financial subsidy. We performed life-cycle and costbenefit analyses for a case recycling enterprise that processes six categories of household appliances. The results show that the reduction potentials of greenhouse gases range from 930-3450 kgCO2e by recycling per ton of household appliances and materials substitution. The recycling enterprise would gain extra revenue ranging from 32 to 160 RMB per ton of appliance if the carbon credits were sold at China’s current carbon price, i.e., 45-60 RMB tCO2e-1. Recycling waste refrigerators exhibits the highest carbon revenue, offsetting 6-17% of the government’s financial subsidy. Microcomputers, by contrast, indicate the lowest carbon revenue, equivalent to 1-3% of its highest government subsidy. For each household appliance category, when the carbon price reaches 270- 600 RMB tCO2e-1, selling carbon credits can fully offset the government’s financial subsidy. Constrained by the processing capacity of the case enterprise, optimizations for appliance-recycling composition contribute a 15-25% profit growth to the current economic gains. Interpreting the specific profit depends on the predefined scenarios of carbon price and the substitution rate of the regenerated materials for the virginal ones. Our findings show that raising the profitability of WEEE recycling enterprises through the carbon trading policy contributes to the sustainable growth of China’s WEEE-recycling sector while alleviating the government’s financial burden. © 2023 American Chemical Society."

Less than 5% of H2 is manufactured by the much cleaner water electrolysis process, mainly because electrodes are based on precious platinum. In line with the worldwide effort of replacing platinum by earth-abundant metals, this study focused on electrocatalytic proton reduction by cobalt. A series of cobalt(III) corroles that greatly varies in the electronic and steric effects of the meso-C substituents was fully characterized for investigating how the complexes differ in terms of their reduction potentials and as electrocatalysts for proton reduction to hydrogen gas. The smallest and most electron-rich derivative, with H atoms rather than larger and more electron-withdrawing substituents on the macrocycle, displayed the most interesting catalytic activity. Despite of its most negative CoII/CoI reduction potential in the absence of acid, catalysis by this complex was characterized by the lowest overpotential and the largest faradaic efficiency, as well as an activity that was almost as good as that of platinum under heterogeneous conditions. Mechanism-of-action investigations via experimental and computational analyses exposed that the superior performance of the most electron-rich complex is attributable to its capability of reducing protons by singly (rather than doubly) reduced cobalt. © 2023 American Chemical Society"

A one-year experimental dataset depicting the wind speed and solar irradiance with a precision of 1 min. The carbon footprint study was conducted, and indicators were applied and evaluated for the purpose of standardising the performance assessment technique for renewable-based hydrogen production systems, such as the electrolyser capacity fulfilled by wind turbines and solar photovoltaic power plants. On the basis of the considered capacities of 2.5 for wind turbines and solar photovoltaics for cost estimating findings, the obtained optimum electrolyser capacity can match the energy produced by the wind turbine power plant, which is 1.5 MW, which can produce hydrogen at a rate of about 11,963 kg/year at 8.87$/kg, and the obtained optimum electrolyser capacity can match the energy produced by the solar photovoltaics power plant, which is 2.0 MW, which can produce hydrogen at a rate of about 94,432 kg/year at 6.33 $/kg. Further, the polynomial relation between hydrogen production and electrolyser capacity has been destroyed. The method used is easily adaptable for testing large-scale applications such as industrial plants, as well as any hydrogen requirements and environmental conditions. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC"

The balancing market (BM) primarily turns down renewable generation and turns up traditional carbon-intensive generation in response to real-time energy imbalance. Existing dual-stage market mechanisms conflict with the carbon reduction trajectory by implementing balancing actions regardless of their carbon footprint. This paper proposes a novel carbon-oriented BM model to coordinate the environmental targets in the day-ahead (DA) and real-time BMs. The emissions of dispatchable generators and flexible loads are distinguished by their operation modes and flexibility types, respectively. Carbon signals are incorporated into their bid/offer prices through the proposed carbon emission flow (CEF) model. By integrating these carbon incentives, the dual-stage market model is formulated to minimize economic and environmental costs. Simulation results demonstrate that, overall, although the proposed BM mechanism results in an increased cost of balancing services (159.10 m£), there is a concurrent larger drop in carbon costs (294.14 m£), resulting in a reduction in total cost. It enables system operators to incentivize decarbonized energy resources in DA scheduling and real-time balancing actions.  © 2022 IEEE."

Green banking (GB) has been proposed as a way to reduce the carbon footprint caused by banking operations by promoting paperless financial services through the intensive use of technology. However, the adoption level of GB technology remains unsatisfactory among customers in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Therefore, using the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), this study aims to comprehensively investigate the challenges affecting the intention of bank consumers in the UAE to adopt GB technology. Design/methodology/approach: This study used exploratory sequential mixed-methods research. Preliminary semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten banking professionals using a purposive sampling technique to explore the challenges affecting consumers’ intention to adopt GB technology. Sequentially, the study tested various factors through a quantitative cross-sectional online survey of a sample of 332 bank customers and used the convenience sampling technique to obtain further empirical support for the research framework. Thematic content analysis using NVivo 11 was used for the qualitative data analysis. Meanwhile, partial least square structural equation modelling in Smart PLS 3.3 was used for the quantitative data analysis. Findings: The qualitative analysis identified six new challenges affecting customers’ intention to adopt GB technology, including customer awareness, personal innovativeness, bank reputation, security and privacy, system quality and government support. The preliminary qualitative findings were confirmed mainly through quantitative data analysis, whereby customer awareness, personal innovativeness, system quality and bank reputation were found to significantly impact customers’ intention to adopt GB technology. However, the effects of security and privacy and government support were insignificant. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to propose a comprehensive model that considers individual, technological, organisational and environmental factors to address the issue of customers’ low GB technology adoption rates in the UAE. Meanwhile, this study extends the UTAUT by integrating new factors. This paper is also among the first to investigate customers’ GB technology adoption intention using a mixed-methods approach, which combines the strengths of quantitative and qualitative methods within the same study to offer better insights than a single-method approach. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Thus, this work is focused on the design of biofilms using sustainable materials (starch and Agave fibers) modified by a green single-step method (GSSM) by ultrasound. Regardless of the botanical source (rice, corn, and potato), the morphological analysis revealed the disruption of starch granules in all sonicated films, which promoted higher content of amylopectin leaching out from the granules to the continuous matrix, increasing the proportion of double helices with more packing as short-range crystallinity and thermal analysis indicated. These changes, in combination with the high interaction with fibers, improved the stiffness values as the storage modulus indicated. The cradle-to-gate inventory-based study of economic and environmental impact demonstrated that corn starch and the GSSM process have the best eco-efficiency among the other starch sources and conventional methods evaluated. Furthermore, starch films containing Agave fibers showed the lowest environmental impacts regarding global warming, ozone depletion, freshwater eutrophication, land use, fossil resource scarcity, and water consumption. These findings can help producers and decision-makers understand the environmental and economic impact of the processes and raw materials used to develop sustainable packaging materials.

Enhancing the Fe content tolerance upper limit in casting aluminum alloys is considered an effective way to promote the application of recycled aluminum production. In this work, it was found that with the Ce and TiCN NPs (nanoparticles) addition simultaneously to A356 alloys, the acicular Fe-rich phases (β-Al5FeSi) which damages the properties can be changed into beneficial phases (core-shell heterostructures) for the alloy, and hence the mechanical properties of A356 alloys can be improved. The TiCN nanoparticles and rare element Ce play crucial roles in the formation of core-shell heterostructures. The formation mechanism of core-shell heterostructure was also systematically researched from the perspective of thermodynamics and kinetics.

PGA is a potential substitute for the current aluminum-plastic composite films used in high barrier packaging applications. However, its poor ductility and narrow processing window limit its application in food packaging. Herein, poly(butylene succinate-co-butylene adipate) (PBSA) was used to fabricate PGA/PBSA blend films through an in situ fibrillation technique and blown film extrusion. Under the elongational flow field used during the extrusion process, a unique hierarchical structure based on the PBSA nanofibrils and interfacially oriented PGA crystals was obtained. This structure enhances the strength, ductility and gas barrier properties of the PGA/PBSA blend film. In addition, an epoxy chain extender (ADR4468) was used as a compatibilizer to further enhance the interfacial adhesion between PGA and PBSA. 70PGA/0.7ADR exhibited a very low oxygen permeability (2.34×10−4 Barrer) with significantly high elongating at break (604.4%), tensile strength (47.4 MPa), and transparency, which were superior to those of petroleum-based polymers. Thus, the 70PGA/0.7ADR blown films could satisfy the requirements for most instant foods such as coffee, peanuts, and fresh meat. © 2023, Chinese Chemical Society Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences."

The objectives of this study were to (i) assess the agronomic performance and C footprint of canola (Brassica napus L.) production in different cropping systems, and (ii) better understand how canola could be adapted to existing cropping systems in eastern Canada. A four-year canola-based phase rotation study, including maize (Zea mays L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and soybean (Glycine max L.), started in 2011 and continued for two cycles in Ottawa, ON; Montreal, QC; and Canning, NS. It was found that, compared to continuous monoculture (canola, maize or wheat), diversified cropping systems increased crop yields by an average of 32% and reduced the C footprint of all rotations by 33%, except under severe heat and drought conditions. The effect of rotation on yield and C footprint of canola production varied significantly among site-years. At Ottawa, the canola following soybean (SC) had 12% higher canola yield than monoculture canola (CC), 5 and 8% higher canola yield than canola following wheat (WC) or maize (MC). At Montreal, canola yield ranked as MC > SC > WC > CC. At Canning, the highest canola yield was in WC (21%) and SC (13%). Overall, most SC rotations had the lowest C footprint, and CC cropping had the highest C footprint, with only a few exceptions. Regardless of the cropping system, canola required more N input and was high in oil and protein in the harvested product, and produced the highest C footprint, while soybean had the lowest C footprint at all three sites. Our findings indicate that a diversified cropping system with canola production following soybean significantly improved canola yield while lowering the C footprint. However, profitable and sustainable canola production in eastern Canada is threatened by climate change-induced drought and heat stress. © 2023, Crown."

Common functionalization processes often require refluxing in nitric acid (HNO3), resulting in poor control while adding safety, cost, and environmental burdens. Using CNTs grown from acetylene, methylacetylene, or vinylacetylene, we examined a vapor-based functionalization technique with hydrochloric acid (HCl), aiming to reduce morphological damage and material and energy consumption. HNO3 enabled increased oxygen addition via liquid versus vapor treatments (1.6-2.2% vs 0.88-1.0%), while HCl preferably added chlorine via vapor treatments (0.05-0.1% vs 0.02-0.03%). Interestingly, liquid HCl treatments yielded 1.2-2.2% oxygen, and for vinylacetylene-derived CNTs, the oxygen addition was greater than a HNO3-treated sample (2.2 ± 1.5 vs 1.6 ± 0.4%), providing important mechanistic insights for the growth of CNTs and subsequent oxygen addition reaction pathways at defect loci. Life cycle impact assessment demonstrated that using HCl reduced global warming potential and ecotoxicity (98 and 92% reductions, respectively) compared to HNO3. Vapor treatments offered additional improvements, primarily via elimination of electric heating required for reflux. These results demonstrate the importance of structure in CNT substitution and the potential for HCl- and vapor-based treatments for soft CNT functionalization with reduced environmental impact. © 2023 American Chemical Society."

Innovation is in integrating the suggested hybrid system so that the use of electricity can effectively be decreased to meet the load. As a result, the system components are not oversized, which reduces system costs and reduces emissions. & amp; copy; 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston. © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH.

By applying corpus linguistics to a sampled literature on decarbonising India's transport sector, we explore three motifs of difference, viz. ‘change’, ‘decarbonisation’ and ‘transition’, and how these motifs are applied within the context of this academic literature to refer to potential opportunities to transform India's developmental trajectory. We find that rather than exploring such opportunities, the sampled papers tend to recirculate discourses influenced by eco-modernisation which, although proposing change to India's carbon footprint, leave the fundamental structure of India's neo-liberal economic model unchallenged, even though, from a developmental discourse perspective, this lies at the root of climate change, and for meaningful change to occur it must be addressed. © The Author(s) 2023."
953,Microgrid resilience: a holistic and context-aware resilience metric,Article,Mishra S.; Kwasnik T.; Anderson K.,Energy Systems,14.0,2023,1081,1105,10.1007/s12667-022-00509-4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126729066&doi=10.1007%2fs12667-022-00509-4&partnerID=40&md5=bf9ae6cbeb3230eb63e7a7a6859f1ef9,18683967,Scopus,Microgrid; Resilience; Resilience quantification; Resilience-metric; Risk assessment; System operation,"Microgrids present an effective solution for the coordinated deployment of various distributed energy resources and furthermore provide myriad additional benefits such as resilience, decreased carbon footprint, and reliability to energy consumers and the energy system as a whole. Boosting the resilience of distribution systems is another major benefit of microgrids. This is because they can also serve as a backup power source when the utility grid’s operations are interrupted due to either high-probability low-impact events like a component failure or low-probability high-impact events—be it a natural disaster or a planned cyberattack. However, the degree to which any particular system can defend, adapt, and restore normal operation depends on various factors including the type and severity of events to which a microgrid is subjected. These factors, in turn, are dependent on the geographical location of the deployed microgrid as well as the cyber risk profile of the site where the microgrid is operating. Therefore, in this work, we attempt to capture this multi-dimensional interplay of various factors in quantifying the ability of the microgrid to be resilient in these varying aspects. This paper, thus, proposes a customized site-specific quantification of the resilience strength for the individual microgrid’s capability to absorb, restore, and adapt to the changing circumstances for sustaining the critical load when a low-probability high-impact event occurs—termed as—context-aware resilience metric. We also present a case study to illustrate the key elements of our integrated analytical approach. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

To provide electrified thrust for aircraft, the converter-fed motor drive system is a promising solution for the energy conversion between an onboard dc distribution bus and a high-speed electric machine. However, the neutral-point potential fluctuation and even drifting can be an outstanding issue when employing three-level neutral-point-clamped (3L-NPC) topologies, which puts the converter output performance and the lifespan of capacitors at risk. To address these problems, in this article, a new hybrid active pulse-width-modulation (PWM) strategy is proposed for the studied airborne electric propulsion systems. With the versatile dual-mode modulation signals, not only can the proposed PWM algorithm keep capacitor voltages balanced at the entire range of operating points but also switching losses can be lowered with the help of discontinuous pulse trains during the cruise. Moreover, the computational burden rendered by a short switching cycle is reduced by the sextant coordinate-based analytical derivation. The effectiveness of the presented modulation technique are validated through simulation results from a Simulink/PLECS model and experimental results obtained from a 200 kVA silicon-carbide (SiC) based T-type 3L-NPC prototype with a variable output fundamental frequency.  © 1972-2012 IEEE."

This article addresses the topical and sensitive issue of supply chain assessment in terms of the carbon footprint and energy efficiency of external transportation from the point of production to the customer. The long transportation distances overseas and the variety of operational sea container services result in significant variations in delivery times from Asian markets. In addition, disruptive events such as the Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine conflict have led to longer transportation times and lower reliability of various maritime services. The study examines the variety of existing direct container services from Asia to the Northern Adriatic. In addition to the two direct container services already established, another dedicated container service has been established primarily to serve a large retail chain in the European market. The “newly established” container service is characterised by its limited port coverage and the use of relatively small container ships with a maximum capacity of 5.500 TEU. The comparisons between the services highlight the differences in transport time and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as well as the energy efficiency of container transport. The study empirically confirms the widespread assumption that larger and modern container ships offer environmental benefits, provided that cargo space is used efficiently and ship operators adopt slow steaming. However, the study also highlights the significant differences in GHG emissions between different services and emphasises the need for more comprehensive information and awareness among cargo owners to design sustainable supply chains. © 2023, University of Dubronvnik.

This work assessed the sustainability of a sequential process in two stages (acidogenic + methanogenic) for the synthesis of H2 and methane (CH4) from vinasses. The considered systems were as follows: system-1 (S-01: synthesis of H2, catalytic reforming of CH4, and purification of H2) and system-2 (S-02: synthesis of H2, electricity generation from the CH4, and purification of H2). Life cycle assessment (LCA) performed with openLCA for the functional unit (FU: 1.00 kg H2, 99.9% purity) concluded that the consumption of electricity and steam is the hotspot of the process because they exert an important impact on environmental categories like global warming (GWP: 86–94%), eutrophication of water bodies (FEP: 87–95%), acidification (TAP: 79–92%), and formation of photochemical oxidants (EOFP and HOFP: 78–91%). Production of 1.00 kg of H2 would lead to the emission of 218 (S-01) and 302 (S-02) (kg CO2-Eqv/kg H2); utilization of the steam excedents from the sugarcane mill and the energy integration of the H2 production process could reduce that footprint about 80% (S-01: 33.5 and S-02: 17.2 kg CO2-Eqv/kg H2). The economic analysis revealed that the production cost (S-01:15.4 and S-02: 8.50 US$/kg H2) is within the range reported for different technologies (5.27–17.2 US$/kg H2). Results suggest that changing the management of vinasses and integrating the existing processes in a sugarcane mill could contribute to the transition of a country to a hydrogen-based economy. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

High nutritional value, low carbon footprint and sustainability are key drivers for seaweed uptake in Europe; yet high iodine intake from seaweed remains a concern. This study seeks to identify seaweed food products available on the UK retail market between 2018 and 2021 and assess their safety in the context of iodine exposure. Design/methodology/approach: Here, a market survey (n = 37–40 retailers) was conducted in three annual waves to evaluate seaweed food product availability in the UK. The iodine dose of products was estimated based on a comprehensive literature review of seaweed iodine content. Findings: This study shows a young, dynamic market with 2.3-fold increase in seaweed food product availability since the last available published data (2015). Specific iodine content labelling remains uncommon, and median iodine doses in a single serving of food exceeded 400 µg in all years. Some products, especially seaweed supplements, provide iodine doses above the tolerable upper limit and upper level of tolerance. Originality/value: This study presents the most contemporary and comprehensive overview of the market for seaweed food products in the UK. With increasing popularisation of seaweed as a food, this study highlights the need for improved dialogue amongst producers, retailers, legislators and public health specialists to address the risk of iodine excess, and the concurrent scope for processing methods to reduce the iodine content in seaweeds. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."

We aimed to evaluate the cost-benefits and the environmental impact of implementing the no-biopsy approach for diagnosing coeliac disease in clinical practice. Design We calculated the overall direct and indirect costs of the conventional serology-biopsy approach and the no-biopsy approach for the diagnosis of coeliac disease based on the national average unit costs and the Office of National Statistics data. We further estimated the environmental impact of avoiding endoscopy based on the estimated greenhouse gas emissions from endoscopy. Results Approximately 3000 endoscopies for suspected coeliac disease could be avoided each year in the UK. Implementing the no-biopsy approach for the diagnosis of coeliac disease in adults could save the National Health Service over £2.5 million in direct and indirect costs per annum and reduce endoscopy carbon footprint by 87 tonnes of CO 2 per year, equivalent to greenhouse gas emissions from driving 222 875 miles, carbon emissions from charging over 10 million smartphones and the carbon sequestrated by 1438 trees grown for 10 years. Conclusion The implementation of this non-invasive green approach could be an essential first step in the 'Reduce' strategy advocated by the British Society of Gastroenterology and other international endoscopy societies for sustainable endoscopy practice.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.

The municipal sewage treatment plants must not only meet discharge standards, but also incorporate energy-saving and carbon reduction measures during the sewage treatment process under China's ""dual carbon"" strategy. This study calculated and analyzed carbon emissions from China's municipal sewage treatment industry between 2012 and 2021, and forecasted the carbon emission intensity and amount in 2030. The findings revealed that the total carbon emissions increased from 29.33 Mt CO2e to 58.95 Mt CO2e over a decade, with direct and indirect emissions rising by 78.04% and 143%, respectively. Direct and indirect emissions in 2021 comprised 57.37% and 42.63% of the industry's total carbon emissions, respectively. Sewage treatment plants accounted for the largest unit of carbon emissions, representing an average of 35%. Without effective carbon reduction measures, the industry's carbon emissions are projected to reach 67.21 Mt CO2e in 2030. Implementing two optimization schemes, the total carbon emissions in 2030 are anticipated to decline to 65.21 Mt CO2e (Optimized 1) or 62.19 Mt CO2e (Optimized 2), corresponding to a 2.98% or 7.46% reduction, respectively, showing a turning point of carbon peaking. These results can provide theoretical and data support for carbon neutralization planning in the sewage treatment industry, and are essential in achieving carbon reduction goals and addressing global warming. © 2023 IOS Press BV.

Our findings demonstrate that a transient 1 min 7.5-fold rate increase of current or carbonate reduction during nucleation of MWCNTs leads to 2.5 times smaller average MWCNT diameters, a higher degree of graphitization in the walls, and an overall 10% lower energy consumption over the full growth duration. Conversely, when identical transient current pulses are applied after MWCNT nucleation in the middle of CNT growth, our findings indicate the deposition of noncatalytic onionlike carbons on the surface of the MWCNTs to form hybrid nanostructured materials, but no changes are observed to MWCNT diameters, energy consumption, or wall graphitization of the MWCNTs. A detailed study of this system by three-electrode cyclic voltammetry, imaging, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy supports the mechanistic role of current pulses in nucleation to facilitate rapid catalyst reduction and minimize coarsening to sustain catalysts with high activity. This work demonstrates how temporally controlled electrochemical current density, and hence carbon flux, in molten carbonate electrolysis is a powerful tool to engineer the production of carbon nanostructures with tailored physical properties and a total energy consumption footprint. © 2023 American Chemical Society."

In this study, carbon footprint (CF) values of four partial harvests of European seabass in earthen pond aquaculture (EPES) and meagre in earthen pond aquaculture (EPM) were determined. The average values of total CF expended for EPES and EPM, which reached a final harvest weight of approximately 1,500 g in 1,061 and 633 days were 3.38 and 2.26 kg CO2e kg1, respectively. The lowest and highest rates of CF expended on consumed compound diet (CFCD) were 63.92 and 65.59% in EPES, and 62.44 and 66.70% in EPM, respectively. The rates of CF general management were 32.0 and 33.57% in EPES and 30.98 and 34.98% in EPM, respectively. Against this high proportion of the compound diet, the second highest value was the lowest and highest proportion of partial harvests of electricity, 28.20 and 29.59% in EPES and 27.09 and 30.51% in EPM, respectively. CF input and CF output per kg values of meagre were decreased with increasing weight, therefore meagre can be defined as a species with high global food security and resilience against climate change. © 2023 The Authors."

Therefore, a deeper comprehension of the relationships between environmental deterioration and its causes is necessary in nations that rely on fossil fuels. This study examines the relationship between per capita carbon dioxide emissions and total natural resources, nonrenewable energy, industrialization, and ecological footprint from 2001 to 2020 in the case of major fossil fuel–consuming countries. The most recent panel Granger causality and panel-corrected standard error (PCSE) simulation models are used in this study. The findings indicate that natural resources, ecological footprint, and registered companies impede environmental quality. Similarly, the same results were noted by employing the generalized least square method. A feedback effect was noted between carbon dioxide emission and ecological footprint, while unidirectional causality between coal consumption and carbon emission. In light of these findings, it is advised that instead of pursuing policies that encourage the use of coal and petroleum, new energy policies enhance the share of nonfossil fuels in the energy mix for controlling rapid industrialization, extraction of natural resources, and environmental and economic issues. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

This is mirrored by a projected increase in global energy demand of approximately 50% within a single generation, urging a shift from fossil-fuel-derived materials toward greener materials and more sustainable manufacturing processes. Biobased industrial byproducts, such as side streams from the food industry, are attractive alternatives with strong potential for valorization due to their large volume, low cost, renewability, biodegradability, and intrinsic material properties. Here, we demonstrate the reutilization of industrial chicken feather waste into proton-conductive membranes for fuel cells, protonic transistors, and water-splitting devices. Keratin was isolated from chicken feathers via a fast and economical process, converted into amyloid fibrils through heat treatment, and further processed into membranes with an imparted proton conductivity of 6.3 mS cm-1 using a simple oxidative method. The functionality of the membranes is demonstrated by assembling them into a hydrogen fuel cell capable of generating 25 mW cm-2 of power density to operate various types of devices using hydrogen and air as fuel. Additionally, these membranes were used to generate hydrogen through water splitting and in protonic field-effect transistors as thin-film modulators of protonic conductivity via the electrostatic gating effect. We believe that by converting industrial waste into renewable energy materials at low cost and high scalability, our green manufacturing process can contribute to a fully circular economy with a neutral carbon footprint. © 2023 American Chemical Society."

One of the key research topics in this area is determining bus service frequency and developing appropriate schedules. The number of buses and their frequencies have a significant impact on the entire transportation system, affecting all users of the network. To address this issue, bus service frequencies during peak hours should be determined based on passenger demand. In this study, the daily frequencies of the bus system of a city (Denizli, Turkey) were investigated, the carbon footprints of the system were analyzed, and suggestions were provided. This is determined by the model developed regarding the linear optimization method. The goal programming approach is used in the analysis. The existing frequencies are compared with that provided by the goal programming approach. Additionally, the results obtained are investigated by a cost analysis regarding different benefit rates (carbon footprint, total kilometer, and passenger comfort) for the public. By implementing the recommended bus service frequencies, significant financial and environmental improvements can be achieved. © 2023 Scientific Publishers. All rights reserved."

MATERIALS/METHODS: By using a stratified proportional allocation method, 536 out of the 11,082 schools nationwide were selected including 21 kindergartens, 287 elementary-, 120 middle-and 108 high schools. A total of 2,680 meals served for 5 consecutive days (June 21–25, 2021) were collected. We analyzed the average serving amounts of protein foods (animal-vs. plant-based) per meal and then, calculated the estimated average amounts of carbon emission equivalents per meal by applying the conversion coefficients. The t-test and analysis of variance were used for statistical analyses (α = 0.05). RESULTS: The average serving amount of animal-based protein foods per meal was 12.5 g, which was approximately 3 times higher than that of plant-based ones (3.8 g) (P < 0.001); the Meat-group had the highest average amount of 17.0 g, followed by Egg-group (9.6 g), Fish-group (7.6 g), and Beans-and-Nuts-group (3.8 g) (P < 0.05). Specifically, pork (25.1 g) was ranked first, followed by poultry (19.6 g), processed meat products (18.0 g). The estimated average amount of carbon emission equivalents of animal-based protein foods per meal was 80.1 g CO2e, which was approximately 31 times higher than that of plant-based ones (2.6 g CO2e) (P < 0.001); the Meat-group had the highest average amount of 120.3 g CO2e, followed by Fish-group (44.5 g CO2e), Egg-group (25.9 g CO2e), and Beans-and-Nuts-group (2.6 g CO2e) (P < 0.05).

However, the roles of terrestrial carbon from land use in river GHG emissions remain largely unknown. We studied the microbial composition, dissolved organic matter (DOM) properties, and GHG emission responses to different landcovers in rivers (n = 100). The bacterial community was mainly constrained by land-use intensity, whereas the fungal community was mainly controlled by DOM chemical composition (e.g., terrestrial DOM with high photoreactivity). Anthropogenic stressors (e.g., land-use intensity, gross regional domestic product, and total population) were the main factors affecting chromophoric DOM (CDOM). DOM biodegradability exhibited a positive correlation with CDOM and contributed to microbial activity for DOM transformation. Variations in CO2 and CH4 emissions were governed by the biodegradation or photomineralization of dissolved organic carbon derived from autotrophic DOM and were indirectly affected by land use via changes in DOM properties and water chemistry. Because the GHG emissions of rivers offset some of the climatic benefits of terrestrial carbon (or ocean) sinks, intensified urban land use inevitably alters carbon cycling and changes the regional microclimate. © 2023 American Chemical Society."

In this study, spatiotemporal patterns of benthic organic carbon flux of a bottom-based Manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum) farm were estimated for a 1 year farming cycle using a carbon flux model coupled to a two-dimensional (2-D) hydrodynamic (MIKE-3) and a clam dynamic energy budget (DEB) model. The simulated flux was compared to the sediment total organic carbon (TOC) and contribution of biodeposits to sediment TOC based on stable isotope signatures. The outputs of the model illustrated a clear “vacuum effect” with increased carbon flux within and near the farming area (deposition area) and reduced flux outside the farm (depletion area), which could also correspond to changes in sediment TOC. Moreover, the contribution of biodeposits to the carbon flux was overall higher compared to that of biodeposits to sediment TOC, indicating a loss of biodeposits from deposition to storage in the sediment. This study highlights the role clam farming plays in the dynamics of organic carbon by linking vertical fluxes with sediment TOC, which addresses the current knowledge gaps related to the carbon footprint in coastal bivalve aquaculture systems. © 2023 The Authors.

Equilibrium thermodynamic parameters (entropy, enthalpy, and internal energy) and the concentration distributions of C-, S-, N-, O-, and H-containing components and active particles in the gas phase were determined. Based on the total concentration distribution of C-, S-, N-, O-, and H-containing components and active particles in the gas phase, the weight content of carbon was calculated. Taking into account the chemical matrix of the furnace fuel oil–air system and the weight content of carbon, the man-made load of carbon in the gas phase was found. The results of the work made it possible to evaluate the carbon footprint in the gas phase because of the combustion of fuel, in particular, furnace fuel oil in air. Reduction of the man-made load of carbon oxides (CO, CO2) in the gas phase was achieved by modifying and burning furnace fuel oil in the form of oil-in-water (reverse) emulsions in E-1/9M industrial boilers. © 2023, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

The carbon stock balance of cropland soils was evaluated by estimating carbon gains and losses, and then the components of the carbon footprint were measured as a ratio of soil organic carbon balance to crop production quantity in terms of grain equivalent (t C/t grain eq.). The estimates for the period 2011–2020 have revealed that there is generally a small net gain of carbon on cropland in Russia, mainly due to the intake of carbon from plant residues. Most of the steppe region of Russia suffers from net losses of carbon at levels from –0.15 t C/t grain eq. up to –0.69 t C/t grain eq. In other regions, such as the Central Chernozem and Black Sea Coast regions, net carbon gain is observed in the range of 0.1–0.3 t C/t grain eq. due to the intake of significant biomass of crop and root residues as a consequence of intensive crop production. © 2023, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

However, not much emphasis is made on the development of mix designs using industrial waste. The current study focuses on the mix-design considerations for GPC using fly ash and Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS). The mix design of GPC involves in selecting materials to produce the desired strength. In this investigation, Water Glass (WG) is used as an activator for the activation of the polymerization reaction. The mix design of GPC is the optimization of a group of various parameters, such as the activator to binder ratio, aggregate to binder ratio, coarse aggregate to fine aggregate ratio, activator concentration, and amount of binder content. The activator to binder ratio affects workability and strength, while the activator concentration influences the polymerization reaction and final strength development. The selection of suitable aggregates plays a vital role in achieving a dense and durable GPC matrix. The mix design for GPC requires a holistic approach that considers the selection of appropriate binders, activators, and aggregates. Proper optimization of these factors can result in excellent strength and durability of the GPC and a reduced carbon footprint. Further research is needed to explore alternative binders, evaluate long-term performance, and establish standardized mix design guidelines for the widespread adoption of GPC in construction. © 2023, Dr D.

The construction sector alone accounted for a staggering 37% of all carbon emissions in 2021. The application of solar architectural principles is emerging as a key strategy to reduce the carbon footprint of civil buildings. This approach includes passive and active solar techniques, alongside energy-efficient measures. Passive strategies include optimal building orientation, envelope improvements to minimize heat exchange, and the use of shading devices. Active measures include the integration of renewable energy sources. In a practical demonstration, a residential building in Russia’s Kaliningrad region illustrates the implementation of these principles. Using passive solar measures and rigorous energy calculations, the building achieved an A+ energy saving class. In addition, the integration of active solar elements, including a 4.5 m2 evacuated thermal collector and 3.56 kW photovoltaic panels, along with an air-to-water heat pump, resulted in a 72% reduction in annual energy consumption for heating, hot water, and electricity—from 27.695 to 7.697 kWh. This results in a significant reduction of 10 tons of carbon emissions per year.

This tool replaces the popular Excel-based data normalization tool that has been in use for over two decades. The new tool is user-friendly and easy to navigate. For a proper system performance assessment and optimization, ultrafiltration (UF) and reverse osmosis (RO) operating data normalization is vital in all systems which treat feed water with variable salinity and/or temperature. FT-Norm PRO (FilmTec™ Normalization of Membrane Systems) is a free online tool that makes the data normalization process simple yet robust enough to allow for effective monitoring of UF and RO systems. This tool helps plant operators explore how variations in feedwater temperature, salinity, or pump pressure can influence a membrane system’s apparent productivity and rejection, making it more obvious when a real change in membrane performance occurs. This paper makes the audience to highlight the purpose and importance of data normalization in UF and RO systems, present the recently launched DuPont WaterApp and introduce the key tools to boost desalination plant performance through digital apps. Online tools assist users in quantifying their savings when using membranes with increased durability. Additionally, these tools can calculate the carbon footprint reduction achieved by implementing FilmTec™ dry seawater reverse osmosis membranes. Users can receive recommendations regarding the most suitable pre-treatment technology or membrane type and estimate the savings obtained using the novel DuPont™ B-Free™ pre-treatment technology to reduce biofouling in reverse osmosis systems. A reference plant, Alicante II Seawater Desalination Plant, will be used as an example to showcase the value of the digital apps.

This study aimed to calculate the baseline carbon inventory of Mercy Health, a provider of health and aged care services in Australia, across emission Scopes 1, 2 and 3. The carbon inventory has clarified the baseline environmental impact, identified carbon hotspots and will inform emissions reduction interventions and a decarbonisation trajectory. Methods. A hybrid carbon footprinting methodology was devised. Established carbon footprinting standards provided methodological guidance. A consulting firm with health service carbon accounting experience provided expertise, rigour and objectivity to the work. Results. In the 2020–21 financial year, the carbon footprint of Mercy Health was 102.96k tCO2-e. Scope 1 emissions accounted for 11.07% (11.40k tCO2-e), followed by Scope 2 with 29.80% (30.68k tCO2-e) and Scope 3 with 59.13% (60.88k tCO2-e). The largest carbon impost group was Building energy (42.01%; 43.25k tCO2-e), followed by Food and catering (9.42%; 9.70k tCO2-e) and Business services (7.74%; 7.97k tCO2-e). Mercy Health’s Health Services, Aged Care and Support Services divisions contributed 49.16, 47.81 and 3.03% (50.61k, 49.23k and 3.12k tCO2-e) of total greenhouse gas emissions respectively. Conclusions. Mercy Health’s Health Services division and Aged Care division each comprised around half of total organisation carbon emissions. Building energy dominated emissions, particularly electricity. The study discovered meaningful differences in the composition of carbon emissions in operational divisions of the organisation, indicating tailored interventions will be required to meet carbon abatement targets.

The cooperation and competition among these populations are dependent on various environmental factors, such as ammonia and dissolved oxygen (DO). In the study, a moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) was operated at low DO (0.1-0.3 mg/L) and varied influent NH4+ (phases I-III: 7, 14, and 33 mg N/L) to obtain an autotrophic nitrogen removal community. CAOB was the dominant ammonia oxidizer throughout under the dual effects of low DO and low residual ammonium. In phase I, the residual NH4+ was <0.2 mg N/L, and CAOB tended toward complete ammonia oxidization for gaining more energy rather than secreting nitrite for AnAOB utilization. With the increase in influent NH4+, AnAOB started to grow and shifted from Ca. Kuenenia (phase II) to Ca. Brocadia dominance (phase III), where residual NH4+ was 0.2-7.6 mg N/L. 15N tracing indicated that nitrite reduction in the MBBR could be mainly attributable to anammox rather than endogenous denitrification. AnAOB also possessed more abundant and diverse nitrite transporter genes (e.g., focA, nirC) than did NOB-Nitrospira for potential efficient nitrite utilization. The CAOB-AnAOB synergy enabled up to ∼35% total nitrogen removal in the MBBR. Microrespirometry tests further revealed that the synergy occurred at DO in the range of 0.01-0.9 mg/L (optimum: 0.3 mg/L). NH4+ and DO concentrations that allow effective CAOB-AnAOB synergy can be applied in improving anammox-based mainstream wastewater nitrogen removal toward low aeration and a carbon footprint. © 2023 American Chemical Society."

Ultrafiltration as a pretreatment has been optimized to compact design utilizing multi-capillary polyethersulfone (PES) membrane, whereas the DuPont™ Multibore™ membrane with seven capillaries has been employed in numerous large-scale applications with proven durability. The next generation of PES membranes has now been developed: a multi-bore PES membrane with 19 capillaries and an inner diameter of 0.7 mm, called DuPont™ Multibore™ PRO, within the recently launched DuPont™ IntegraTEC™ ultrafiltration portfolio. This new membrane geometry enables more membrane surface area per module, decreasing the number of required modules, hence decreasing the overall physical footprint for membrane modules by up to 17%. As a result, less material usage per m2 membrane surface area is needed to have a positive sustainability impact on module production, transportation, as well as end-of-life handling, leading to a significant overall reduction of the CO2 footprint. This study presents the results of the DuPont™ Multibore™ PRO being operated in a surface water and a seawater application. The surface water site is at a river in Germany. The seawater site is located at the Gulf in Qatar. This paper presents results of evaluation tests performed at these two locations with a multi-capillary ultrafiltration membrane. All results show comparable performance in terms of reversible fouling, chemical cleaning pattern, recovery, filtration flux and overall stable operation. At the surface water site, coagulant employed in the same concentration for the DuPont™ Multibore™ with 7 capillaries as for the DuPont™ Multibore™ PRO. Here, the feed water quality fluctuations in terms of turbidity are significantly higher compared to the seawater sites reflecting more stressful operating conditions. Additionally, the organic background level is higher with 5–8 mg/L dissolved oxygen carbon at the river water site. Polyaluminium chloride-based coagulation captures organic components which are then retained by the membranes. Due to the very unfavorable interactions with PES membrane surfaces, the fouling layer of coagulant is completely reversible during backwashes. © 2023 Desalination Publications."

Among the technologies investigated in the last decades, biomass gasification acquired great interest owing to the possibility to obtain low cost and CO2 negative emission hydrogen production from a large variety of everywhere available organic wastes. Upstream and downstream treatment were then studied in order to maximize hydrogen yield, reduce the content of organic and inorganic contaminants under the admissible levels for the technologies which are coupled with, capture, and convert carbon dioxide. However, studies which analyse a whole process made of all those technologies is still missing. In order to fill this lack, the present paper investigated the coexistence of Hydrothermal Carbonization (HTC), Sorption Enhance Gasification (SEG), Hot Gas Cleaning (HGC), and CO2 conversion by Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) plasma reactor for H2 production from biomass waste by means of Aspen Plus software. The proposed model aimed to identify and optimise the performance of the plant by varying operating parameters (such as temperature, CaO/biomass ratio, separation efficiency, etc.).

980,The implications of food loss on East Africa’s environment and water resources,Article,Kipkirui E.; Zhao J.; Wang T.; Bavumiragira J.P.; James J.C.; Ndizeye Y.,Journal of Water and Climate Change,14.0,2023,3435,3446,10.2166/wcc.2023.085,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85175556417&doi=10.2166%2fwcc.2023.085&partnerID=40&md5=8230c9b646ff1f47e56a5e34ef199ab1,20402244,Scopus,carbon emissions; East Africa; environment; food wastage impacts; water footprint; water resources,"Food losses threaten food security and sustainability in East Africa, a region that faces recurrent droughts and socio-economic shocks. The research utilized the water footprint method and the carbon emission factor to quantify the water footprint and the carbon footprint of food losses of five plant-based food varieties: cereals, vegetables, oil crops, fruits, and pulses. The study focused on the actual food losses in East Africa – Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania – obtained from the enhanced food balance sheets in 2017. The study finds that the volume of the water wasted associated with the food losses (green þ blue) was 6,164.1 million m3 (M.m3). Food loss also contributes to the degradation of the environment in the form of greenhouse gases (e.g. CO2 and CH4) and a source of non-point pollution of water resources. As a result, the greywater footprint was 838.1 M.m3 and carbon emissions were 5.53 million tons. In contrast to Kenya and Tanzania, Uganda had the lowest carbon and water footprint. These results can further clarify our understanding of the regional and global impacts of food losses on the environment and suggest that reducing food losses can help improve food security, conserve water resources, and protect the environment. © 2023 The Authors."
981,Towards Smart and Green Features of Cloud Computing in Healthcare Services: A Systematic Literature Review,Article,Arega A.; Sharma D.P.,Journal of Information Systems Engineering and Business Intelligence,9.0,2023,161,180,10.20473/jisebi.9.2.161-180,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176015303&doi=10.20473%2fjisebi.9.2.161-180&partnerID=40&md5=740db65b637abb1af3d4dec9282621c1,25986333,Scopus,Cloud computing; Consolidation; Green computing; Green features; Healthcare services; Systematic literature review,"Background: The healthcare sector has been facing multilateral challenges regarding the quality of services and access to healthcare innovations. As the population grows, the sector requires faster and more reliable services, but the opposite is true in developing countries. As a robust technology, cloud computing has numerous features and benefits that are still to be explored. The intervention of the latest technologies in healthcare is crucial to shifting toward next-generation healthcare systems. In developing countries like Ethiopia, cloud features are still far from being systematically explored to design smart and green healthcare services. Objective: To excavate contextualized research gaps in the existing studies towards smart and green features of cloud computing in healthcare information services. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of research publications indexed in Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, and ProQuest. 52 research articles were screened based on significant selection criteria and systematically reviewed. Extensive efforts have been made to rigorously review recent, contemporary, and relevant research articles. Results: This study presented a summary of parameters, proposed solutions from the reviewed articles, and identified research gaps. These identified research gaps are related to security and privacy concerns, data repository standardization, data shareability, self-health data access control, service collaboration, energy efficiency/greenness, consolidation of health data repositories, carbon footprint, and performance evaluation. Conclusion: The paper consolidated research gaps from multiple research investigations into a single paper, allowing researchers to develop innovative solutions for improving healthcare services. Based on a rigorous analysis of the literature, the existing systems overlooked green computing features and were highly vulnerable to security violations. Several studies reveal that security and privacy threats have been seriously hampering the exponential growth of cloud computing. 54 percent of the reviewed articles focused on security and privacy concerns. © 2023 The Authors.

982,Analyzing the non-linear association between urbanization and ecological footprint: an empirical analysis,Article,Arif M.; Gill A.R.; Ali M.,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,30.0,2023,109063,109076,10.1007/s11356-023-30012-x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85172692559&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-023-30012-x&partnerID=40&md5=8a88dfe44c3257bb6a7f3b090543ca5b,09441344,Scopus,Ecological footprint; Environmental degradation; NARDL; Pakistan; Urbanization,"Due to urbanization’s substantial impact on economic development and environmental quality, particularly in emerging nations, the subject has attracted major attention in recent years. Urbanization increases infrastructure, transportation, and high energy consumption demand, leading to increased environmental degradation. Therefore, this study examines how urbanization has affected environmental degradation in Pakistan using yearly data from 1970 to 2020. A non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) model is applied to study the asymmetric impact of urbanization on ecological footprint per capita. The results show that urbanization is asymmetrically associated with environmental degradation. Positive changes in urbanization led to increased environmental degradation, while negative changes in urbanization led to a decline in environmental degradation in Pakistan. Foreign direct investment and industrial production are positive and significant factors of environmental degradation, while trade openness and money supply are negatively linked with environmental degradation in Pakistan. Economic growth shows a positive link, while economic growth square shows a negative link with environmental degradation. These findings also confirm the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis in Pakistan. It is suggested that the urbanization threshold should be analyzed to determine where environmental degradation tends to decline, and less polluting technology and renewable energy resources should be encouraged to reduce environmental degradation in Pakistan. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

However, the full impact of these activities on terrestrial biomass carbon remains unexplored. In this study, we examined changes in global human footprint (HFP) and human-induced aboveground biomass carbon (AGBC) losses from 2000 to 2018. Our findings show an increasing trend in HFP globally, resulting in the conversion of wilderness areas to highly modified regions. These changes have altered global biomes' habitats, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. We also found accelerated AGBC loss driven by HFP expansion, with a total loss of 19.99 ± 0.196 PgC from 2000 to 2018, especially in tropical regions. Additionally, AGBC is more vulnerable in the Global South than in the Global North. Human activities threaten natural habitats, resulting in increasing AGBC loss even in strictly protected areas. Therefore, scientifically guided planning of future human activities is crucial to protect half of Earth through mitigation and adaptation under future risks of climate change and global urbanization. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Along with a growing, albeit sporadic, set of life cycle assessment (LCA) (and “carbon footprinting”) studies of specific medical products and procedures, there is growing interest in “environmental footprinting” of hospitals. In this article, we advance this rapidly evolving area through a comprehensive organizational LCA of a 40-bed hospital in British Columbia, Canada, in its 2019 fiscal year. Our results indicate that the total environmental footprint of the hospital includes, among other things, global warming potential of 3500–5000 t CO2 eq. (with 95% confidence). “Hotspots” in this footprint are attributable to energy and water use (and wastewater released), releases of anesthetic gases (which are potent GHGs), and the upstream production of the thousands of materials, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and other products used in the hospital. The generalizability and comparability of these results are limited by inconsistencies across the few environmental footprinting studies of hospitals conducted to date. Nonetheless, our novel methodological approach, in which we compiled new LCA data for 200 goods and services used in healthcare—strategically selected to statistically represent the 2927 unique products in the hospital's “supply-chains”—has broad applicability in healthcare and beyond. © 2023 by the International Society for Industrial Ecology."
985,A systematic analysis of research trends on the utilization of life cycle assessment in pharmaceutical applications,Article,Sabour M.R.; Zarrabi H.; Hajbabaie M.,International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology,20.0,2023,10921,10942,10.1007/s13762-023-05103-4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85166967883&doi=10.1007%2fs13762-023-05103-4&partnerID=40&md5=f3067c2fe19a9b7931f34fdde35cd7b0,17351472,Scopus,Bibliometric analysis; Environmental footprint; Life cycle assessment; Pharmaceuticals; Social network analysis; Sustainable pharmacy,"Pharmaceutical manufacturing on a large scale and the presence of pharmaceuticals in the environment have sparked growing concern. The life cycle assessment (LCA) technique is an efficient tool for analyzing any potential environmental impacts associated with pharmaceuticals at each step of their life cycle. This study presents research trends and future directions of pharma-LCAs through bibliometric indicators. The Scopus database was used to collect the literature dataset. Between 2000 and 2022, a total of 207 documents involving “pharmaceutical” and “LCA” were released. Numerous aspects of these documents, including subject categories, journals, articles, countries, affiliations, funding sponsors, authors, and keywords, have been systematically examined in this research. Collaborations between authors and countries were visualized and analyzed by using social network analysis based on co-authorship relations. Additionally, keywords were clustered using co-occurrence relations to discover the most trending topics in the literature review. The research showed that as an evolutionary process, the utilization of the life cycle assessment method has continued to increase in the pharmaceutical sector within the period. As well, the principal focus of studies has been on pharmaceuticals for human consumption. The analysis of extracted keywords reveals that green chemistry, energy efficiency, and sustainable pharmacy have always been the main topics. However, in recent years, researchers' focus has shifted to environmental impacts, carbon footprint, wastewater treatment, human toxicity, active pharmaceutical ingredients and blisters.

This practice is widespread for reporting ‘scope 2’ electricity emissions and has recently been proposed for both ‘scope 1’ (direct) and ‘scope 3’ (other value chain) emission sources. However, the market-based method has been criticised for undermining the accuracy of GHG disclosures, and it is therefore highly important to explore the requirements for accurate GHG inventories and the solutions to market-based accounting. Methods: This paper uses two methods: firstly, thought experiments are used to identify principles for accurate corporate GHG inventories and, secondly, formal prescriptions are developed for possible solutions to market-based accounting. Results and discussion: The findings identify six principles for accurate corporate GHG inventories, which are then used to inform the development of two possible solutions. The first solution is to report changes in emissions caused by company actions separately from the GHG inventory, including any changes caused by the purchase of emission attribute certificates. The second solution proposes a causality requirement for the use of emission attributes in GHG inventories. Although the analysis focuses on corporate or organisational GHG inventories, the principles and solutions apply equally to attributional product carbon footprinting and life cycle assessment more broadly. Conclusions: We emphasise that inventories are only one form of accounting method, and their accuracy should not be undermined by attempting to fulfil functions that are best served by other methods. © 2023, The Author(s)."

This review paper examines the classification and applications of dyes, highlighting the challenges posed by synthetic dyes and the growing interest in natural dyes. The impact of textile dyes on human health, ecosystems, water, soil, and air emissions is explored. The focus then shifts to sustainable dyeing practices in the denim industry, which can significantly reduce its environmental footprint and enhance product sustainability. The adoption of sustainable dyes aligns with circular economy principles, leading to energy and water savings. Collaboration, consumer awareness, and the integration of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) are essential for driving sustainable dye adoption and promoting circular economy principles. The role of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors in sustainable denim dyeing is emphasized, encompassing environmental, social, and governance considerations throughout the supply chain. The need to address greenwashing and validate sustainability claims is discussed, highlighting the importance of certifications and transparency. Chemical dyes are recognized as key contributors to achieving sustainability targets in the denim industry, aligning with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and reducing carbon emissions. The review concludes by stressing the importance of sustainable dyeing practices, considering water and energy usage, waste generation, and emissions, to minimize the denim industry's environmental impact and achieve sustainability objectives. © 2023 Global NEST Printed in Greece.

Monitoring the progress of such policies requires robust estimates of environmental pressures and impacts, both from a domestic and a footprint perspective. Building on the life cycle assessment-based consumption footprint (CoF) indicator, developed by the European Commission Joint Research Centre, we assess the environmental impacts of Germany's consumption in the areas of food, mobility, housing, household goods, and appliances during the period 2010–2018. A comparison between European and national consumption statistics revealed some differences in terms of data composition, granularity, consumption intensities, and calculated environmental impacts. Using national data sources results in slightly lower environmental impacts (e.g., due to differences in the assessment scope of national statistics) and requires some data preparation to match the CoF indicator. Emerging consumption trends can be highlighted using national data. Both data sources converge on main trends: Germany transgresses the safe operating space for several impact categories, with consumption of food, household goods, and mobility being the main drivers. Domestic impacts have decreased over time at the expense of outsourcing environmental pressures and impacts to other countries. The CoF indicator could complement resource monitoring frameworks and might be further aligned to the national context using country-level consumption statistics and life cycle inventory data. © 2023 The Authors.

In this context, the ecological footprint (EF), which has recently been the most widely used environmental indicator in the literature and is known as the most comprehensive because it includes many environmental factors, has been determined as the dependent variable. As independent variables, renewable energy consumption (REC), energy-related tax revenue (ETR), and energy productivity (EP) are included in the model. GDP and development of environment-related technologies (DET), which affect the ecological footprint in the model, are determined as control variables. As a result of the panel data analysis, according to the Durbin–Hausman cointegration test result, a long-term relationship between the variables was determined. According to the CCE estimator analysis, it can be said that there is a positive relationship between ETR and GDP variables and EF. For the AMG estimator analysis, it can be said that there is a positive relationship between GDP and EP variables and EF. Finally, according to the results of the Konya Causality test, a unidirectional causality relationship is detected from environmental technologies to the ecological footprint in Turkey, and a unidirectional causality relationship from the ecological footprint to GDP in Czechia, Romania, and Turkey. Furthermore, no causality relationship is detected between other variables. Based on the results, several policy implications are suggested. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Drinking water requires special treatment to be potable and usable by the general public, treatments that consume a certain amount of energy. In addition, the treatment process of wastewater before it is discharged into the environment consumes energy. According to the study, the energy required for wastewater treatment is significantly greater than the energy required for preparing drinking water. Water treatment is a significant source of GHG emissions due to the use of energy and chemicals, and reducing energy consumption would significantly reduce our overall carbon footprint. Furthermore, the UN's Sustainable Development Goals encourage access to safe drinking water and sanitation while also calling for greater resource efficiency. This research aims to provide an overview of the energy used in water treatment. This study attempts to depict the energy used in water treatment. Electricity consumption for water supply and wastewater treatment is substantial and has a significant environmental impact, particularly in countries where electricity is generated using fossil fuels. © 2023 The Author(s)"

Recently published work (Schaefer et al., 2018) claims that γ-irradiated PET waste powder can be used as a partial replacement of cement in concrete for reducing its CO2 footprint. More specifically, exposure of PET to γ-irradiation at a dosage of 100 kGy alters its crystal structure and chemical composition, which in turn leads to a smaller reduction in concrete strength compared to non-irradiated PET waste. Hence, making it possible for irradiated PET waste to be used as a raw ingredient in the manufacture of concrete while at the same time diverting significant quantities of PET waste from landfills. The aim of this research was to independently assess and verify the above claims. For this purpose, the effect of different low irradiation dosages (0, 10 and 100 kGy) and different replacement levels (2.5 %, 5 % and 10 % by volume) of cement by PET waste on the consistency and mechanical strength of pastes and mortars was determined in a laboratory investigation. XRD, TGA and DSC were also used to study the effect of irradiation on the microstructure of raw PET waste and the microstructure of paste and mortar samples containing irradiated PET waste powder. Our results indicate that use of γ-irradiated PET waste (exposed to an irradiation dosage of up to 100 kGy) for partially replacing cement does not lead to a significant recovery of mechanical strength lost when non-irradiated PET waste is used. © 2023 The Authors"

Most of the cocoa area (82 %) is managed by smallholders with <10 ha under cultivation. Despite the socioeconomic and environmental importance of these systems, there are no previous studies that provide an integrated view of the energy metabolism and economic viability of different smallholder management styles. Consequently, the objective of this work is twofold: a) to estimate the aggregate energy and economic metabolism of small cocoa producers (< 10 ha) in the Ecuadorian Amazon and b) to investigate the existing differences in the technical-economic management styles of the crop. To this end, primary data were collected from a statistically representative sample of cocoa-growing areas distributed among 279 producers in 86 communities in the region, using the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology and a cost-benefit analysis associated with management. Our data show that most smallholder farmers produce cocoa in low-input diversified agroforest system with a high share of unpaid family labor. At the Amazon level, smallholder farmers (< 10 ha) produced 16.9 million tons of food for the market with a non-renewable cumulative energy demand (NR CED) of 53.8 TJ (1343 MJ/ha), a carbon footprint (CF) of 8.16 Mt. CO2-eq. (203.9 kg CO2-eq/ha), and a net margin of 19.07 million $ (476.8 $/ha). On average, cocoa yields were estimated at 288 kg/ha, resulting in a NR CED and carbon footprint (CF) per kg of cocoa of 4.18 MJ and 0.98 kg CO2-eq. Despite its apparent homogeneity, three distinct styles of crop management were identified by a cluster analysis. The results suggest that farms with good organic/agroecological management can have a similar income generating capacity to the more intensive conventional farms evaluated, but with better environmental outcomes. Consequently, the paper finally discusses the need to promote public actions and policies that allow for the scaling up and improvement of successful agroecological management in the Ecuadorian Amazon. © 2023 The Authors"

The role of the luxury sector in setting trends and negotiating power within the supply chain can lead this industry towards sustainability. This study constructs a comprehensive operational flux inventory attributed to an Italian luxury garment brand, aiming to investigate and propose feasible strategies to reduce potential impacts coupled with their products. Methods: Under the operational control criteria, a whole year of activities was tracked using mainly primary data from its management system. According to ISO 14064–1:2019, potential greenhouse gas emissions were classified, organized, and processed into six categories. The analysis, at the company level, covered the product’s complete life cycle, i.e., from cradle to the grave. The ecoinvent database considered preferentially local geography, and the cut-off system approach, therefore assigning emissions to the primary user. Results and discussion: Results showed that the only unit in central Italy where the headquarter is located (excluding retail stores), producing 485,193 women’s clothing in a year, emitted 9804 t CO2 eq. Most of these impacts (69% or 6752 t CO2 eq) can be associated with indirect emissions related to raw products and materials, and about 93% of this amount results from the high-quality products used by the company. Transportation represents 14% of the total emissions, while the use phase accounts for about 13%. As a final step, six different mitigation scenarios were proposed and analyzed by focusing on non-core production activities, i.e., upstream, and downstream operations, and consumers’ habits. Once combined, these strategies can potentially reduce by about 25% the study case company overall emissions. Conclusions: As a conclusion, exploring possible alternatives through environmental assessment tools can support strategies for achieving impact reduction. While aggressive changes can be done in non-core activities with excellent results, changes perceived by the customers can also be well desired to mark innovation and advances in the business mindset. © 2023, The Author(s)."
994,A first-principles study of B/N doping on the transport properties of ultrafine single-walled carbon nanotubes,Article,Wang L.; Wen R.; Deng J.; Liang Y.; Chen Q.; Shao Q.,Chinese Journal of Physics,85.0,2023,571,582,10.1016/j.cjph.2023.06.021,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85169816116&doi=10.1016%2fj.cjph.2023.06.021&partnerID=40&md5=fd139dfec26c1f0c9d480e0d4b941b5c,05779073,Scopus,B/N doped junction; Density functional theory (DFT); Electronic transport; Non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF); SWCNT,"As the size of carbon nanotube (CNT)-based devices continues to shrink, the demand for the development of a new kind of miniature nanodevice is starting to be on the agenda. In single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) of different sizes, B and N atoms are doped into the electrodes and central scattering region in different patterns to create a nanoscale junction with rectification properties. With a width of 0.6 nm and a length of 3.4 nm, this junction channel has a footprint of 5.1 nm. We found that this nano-junction has the properties of an ideal diode. With the 0.4 V bias, the junction emits a leakage current of 2.5 × 10−6 µA, a rectifying ratio of 7.96 × 104, which is far greater than the high-performance transistor device built on semiconductor CNT arrays under a 0.4 V bias. To further analyze the effect of device size and doping lattice sites on the transport characteristics, we have analyzed how the concentration and distribution of different dopants in nanoscale CNTs of different lengths affect the I-V curves of CNTs so that later studies can select the appropriate doping structure as needed. © 2023 The Physical Society of the Republic of China (Taiwan)"
995,Do natural resources affect environmental quality in MINT Economies? The role of tourism and financial development,Article,Faisal F.; Rahman S.U.; Ali A.; Sulimany H.G.H.; Bazhair A.H.; Pervaiz R.,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,30.0,2023,103958,103971,10.1007/s11356-023-29520-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85170377153&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-023-29520-7&partnerID=40&md5=fa17e0597cb10252bf3621b1ad8aec2b,09441344,Scopus,Ecological footprint; Financial development; Natural resources; Renewable energy; Tourism,"With the growing nature of the ecological footprint, research studies focus on exploring new determinants of environmental degradation. Moreover, the role of natural resources and energy consumption in environmental quality has gained much attention in the literature. However, tourism raises the demand for energy consumption and extraction of natural resources. This research study investigates the influence of natural resources, tourism, and renewable energy in MINT countries, using novel Cross-Sectional Auto Regressive Distributive Lag (CS-ARDL) methodological techniques and employing yearly data from 1995 to 2018. The study also applied recently developed Kónya (Econ Model 23:978–992, 2006) causality to identify the causal relationship between the variables of the heterogenous panel. The result shows that tourism, natural resources, and economic growth are positively associated with the ecological footprint in the long-run. However, renewable energy consumption negatively impacts ecological footprint in both in short-run and the long-run. Further, the study explored a bidirectional causality between economic growth and ecological footprint in MINT countries. Finally, based on the empirical results, the study recommends that the authorities in MINT countries revisit their tourism, natural resources, and economic activities policies to enhance the environmental quality and reduce the ecological footprint. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

The report discussed the potential of biofuels to contribute to a significant market supply, thus replacing fossil fuels and mitigating global warming, and it underscores the challenges in expanding biofuel production and replicating successful models between countries and regions. Based on the lessons learned from conventional, established technologies, the authors analyzed policies, feedstocks, products, technologies, economics, environmental concerns, social aspects, scalability, and ease of implementation and replication in different countries or regions. There are blending mandates in place around the world to foster the use of biofuels. Dependence on the availability and price fluctuations of crop feedstocks may limit biofuel production in certain circumstances. Legal restrictions on using food crops as feedstocks present obstacles to scaling up production. Temporary constraints related to feedstock costs and availability, as evidenced by changes and postponements of biofuel blending mandates in various countries (particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic) also pose challenges. Technological hurdles exist for advanced biofuels that implicate premium pricing. Still, 2G ethanol from sugarcane meets very strict feedstock requirements with a carbon footprint so low that only electric vehicles charged in Norway could have life-cycle GHG emissions at the same level as a 2G ethanol-fueled combustion engine car. The authors evaluate whether and how much electrification could contribute to advance the decarbonization efforts in different countries. Drawing from these observations, the authors express their viewpoints to assist researchers and policymakers in the energy sector in formulating viable approaches to combat the climate crisis. © 2023 The Authors.

997,Environmental impact of foreign direct investment in Turkey: does the quality of institutions matter? Evidence from time series analysis using the Fourier extension,Article,Mukiyen Avcı G.,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,30.0,2023,107841,107853,10.1007/s11356-023-29964-x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85172019611&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-023-29964-x&partnerID=40&md5=cc5a162ed4716182166f45db1de7ee73,09441344,Scopus,Ecological footprint; Fourier function; Institutional quality; Pollution halo hypothesis; Pollution haven hypothesis,"Since the 1980s, Turkey has experienced a significant increase in both foreign direct investment (FDI) and its ecological footprint (EFP). While FDI is widely acknowledged as a pivotal driver of economic growth, its impact on environmental degradation is multifaceted and debated. Moreover, a country’s institutional framework plays a key role in shaping this relationship. Yet, the influence of institutional structures on the FDI-environment nexus is often neglected in current literature. In this study, we investigate the environmental implications of FDI in Turkey from 1984 to 2018, employing time series analysis with a Fourier extension and accounting for institutional quality. Fourier function models give more effective results in modeling structural breaks. We first use Fourier techniques to assess the unit root and cointegration relationship. Upon establishing cointegration, we employ the DOLS estimator, extended with Fourier terms, to determine the long-term coefficients. We then assess the causal relationship between the variables using the Fourier causality test. Our findings indicate that while FDI exacerbates environmental degradation (supporting the pollution haven hypothesis), the interaction term of FDI-institutional quality mitigates this degradation (supporting the pollution halo hypothesis). Given these empirical findings, this study suggests that strengthening Turkey’s institutional quality has the potential to amplify the environmental advantages of FDI, alongside its economic benefits. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

There exists a strong correlation between sustainable economic expansion and energy consumption, which in turn results in the generation of elevated levels of carbon emissions. Moreover, it is plausible that a correlation exists between military spending and the degradation of the environment. The primary objective of this study is to examine the emissions of carbon and emissions of greenhouse gases in the N-11 countries, as these nations exhibit comparatively elevated levels of such emissions. Therefore, this study examines the correlation among economic growth, militarization, renewable energy, and environment in the Next Eleven nations from 1990 to 2022. The cross-section autoregressive distributed lag (CS-ARDL) model is employed to analyze the enduring and immediate connections between variables. Empirical evidence indicates that a country’s environment is positively influenced by GDP and militarization. The escalation of military capital intensity has exacerbated the environmental damage. Increasing the adoption of renewable energy sources can mitigate negative environmental impacts over time. This study proposes policy recommendations for sustainable development, including reducing militarization and improving the use of clean energy. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

In this vein, the present study examines the possible impact of internet use, forestation, energy consumption, gross domestic product per capita, and urbanization on environmental degradation through two dependent variables such as carbon dioxide and ecological footprint, for a robustness check. According to the linear Autoregressive Distributed Lag Method, analyzing the annual data of the 1990–2020 period: (1) there is cointegration in the long run, and, the linear combinations converge to the equilibrium point; (2) the long-run elasticity of gross domestic product per capita is neither negative nor more minor than the short-run elasticity in either model, thus, the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis for Türkiye is not verified; (3) in the long run, all variables, except forestation, increase environmental degradation; (4) while internet usage rates have a finite negative effect, the positive impact of forestation variables on environmental degradation is particularly evident. Regarding causality, (5) bidirectional causality relationship exists between ecological footprint and internet usage rates, forestation, and urbanization. (6) One-way causality relationships exist going from carbon dioxide emissions to gross domestic product per capita, internet use, and forestation rate. The results reveal that while internet use increases environmental degradation by increasing energy consumption, it also reverses the degradation with some positive externalities. Finally, as expected, the increase in forestation appears to be a natural solution for environmental degradation in the country. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Iranian Society of Environmentalists (IRSEN) and Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University."

In this study, we examine whether the effect of shocks on the ecological balance is permanent or temporary in the EU-15 countries, considering the period from 1961 to 2018. The application of unit root tests, with and without a Fourier function, indicates that the effects of shocks are temporary in only four countries. To reveal the persistence of shocks at different frequencies, that is, the short-, medium-, and long-run, we decomposed the ecological balance series by using the Discrete Wavelet Transform method. The unit root test results show that the effects of shocks are temporary in all countries in the short-run. However, the results also show that the shocks are temporary in nine countries in the medium-run and ten countries in the long-run. Thus, the implemented policies to balance ecology are not effective in the short-run but are effective in only six countries in the medium-term and in only five countries in the long-term. These findings demonstrate the importance of considering different frequencies when testing the effectiveness of empirically implemented policies. Regarding policy implications, this study suggests focusing on medium- and long-term environmental policies rather than short-term ones. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

They offer lower carbon footprint, higher biodegradability, higher specific strength, higher thermal, and acoustic characteristics. On the other hand, properties of synthetic glass fibers (GFs) such as high specific strength to weight ratio, great resistance during impact, and high durability extend their application perspective for various engineering materials. As such, in the present study, mechanical properties and thermal stability of hybrid laminate comprising of natural fiber (i.e., AF and RF) and synthetic fiber (i.e., GF) fabricated using hand layup process were investigated. Experimental findings reveal that sequencing of the fibers significantly affects properties of the composite. Introducing a layer of AF between RF increased the tensile strength by 30.2% respectively while hybrid laminates composed of three successive layers of RF exhibited 12.6% higher impact strength compared to hybrid laminate composed of AF. Besides, the thermal stability of hybrid laminates was higher (i.e., minimal weight loss of <6.1% when heated up to 800°) compared to neat polymer or laminates with single reinforcement. The enhanced thermal stability, mechanical properties, and tribological properties of the “greener” hybrid laminates can be employed in various structural or lightweight industrial applications. Highlights: Hybridization using natural fibers and synthetic fibers are attempted and investigated. Fiber sequencing significantly affects mechanical properties of the composite. Higher thermal stability of hybrid laminates, that is, minimal weight loss of <6.1% when heated up to 800°. Laminated composed of AF in between RF exhibited lowest frictional coefficient. “Green” hybrid polymer laminate suitable for various structural and lightweight industrial applications is identified. © 2023 Society of Plastics Engineers."

Generally, in order to measure the sustainability of the environment, carbon dioxide emissions and ecological footprint indicators are used. However, these variables do not reflect the supply side of natural resources. Therefore, load capacity factor is an important environmental indicator for a sustainability. Environmental assessment based on the load capacity factor is more meaningful. Besides, improved access to financial services can contribute to environmental sustainability. The effect of financial inclusion on the load capacity factor in Türkiye has not been examined in the current literature. In this context, this study analyzes the impact of financial inclusion, hydropower energy consumption, and life expectancy at birth on environmental sustainability from a different perspective by focusing on load capacity factor. To this end, this study used the newly developed Augmented ARDL method to determine the cointegration relationship between the series and measure the values of the long-term coefficients. Based on the Augmented ARDL method, there is a cointegration relationship between the series. In the long run, hydropower energy consumption reduces pollution, while financial inclusion decreases load capacity factor. The effect of life expectancy at birth on pollution is not significant. Moreover, the results reveal that the load capacity curve hypothesis is valid in Türkiye. As a result, the Turkish government should promote renewable energy sources, especially hydropower energy consumption, align financial services with pollution reduction measures, and contribute to the creation of an environmentally conscious society. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

In the present work, composite cement (CC) prepared by interblending of fly ash (FA) and granulated blast furnace slag (GBFS) with ordinary Portland cement (OPC) was used to prepare four grades of CC concretes, viz. M20, M30, M40 and M50, based on guidelines recommended by three international standards, viz. Indian Standard 10262:2019 (IS), American Concrete Institute 211.1-91:2000 (ACI), British Standard 8500-2:2015 (BS) and the reference modified Andreassen model (MAM) through ideal packing curves. The main aim of this study is to establish the influence of ideal gradation of total particulate matrix of concrete constituents on fresh, mechanical and sustainable properties of concretes. In the design of MAM-based concrete mixes, the total particulate matter comprising of coarse aggregates, fine aggregates, cement, FA and GBFS was optimized to match the ideal packing curves of MAM. The particle size distribution curves obtained for total particulate matrix of four grades of concretes designed as per IS, ACI and BS are compared with ideal packing curves of MAM. The concrete mixes designed as per MAM showed better sustainable properties and comparable mechanical properties with respect to concrete mixes designed using other international standards. © 2023, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals."

There are more environmentally friendly alternatives such as dry powder inhalers (DPIs) or soft mist inhalers (SMIs). Aims: This study aims to approximate the carbon footprint of inhalers dispensed in Irish healthcare. Methods: Health Market Research data was used to examine the number of inhalers sold in Ireland in 2019 via dispensing data from pharmacy IT systems. The carbon footprint per inhaler data was then used to calculate the total carbon footprint of each drug class, and an estimate for the total carbon footprint of inhalers sold in Ireland was generated. Results: 4,427,287 inhalers were dispensed in Ireland in 2019 of which 2,608,433 (59%) were MDIs and 1,818,854 were DPIs/SMIs (41.1%). The total carbon equivalent of these inhalers was estimated to be 54,765 tCO2. MDIs account for 59% of inhaler units dispensed but account for 97% of inhaler-related carbon emissions. Conclusion: Targeting inhaler prescribing offers the potential to significantly improve the carbon footprint of Irish healthcare. Establishing the current carbon footprint of the inhalers that are prescribed, dispensed, and disposed in Ireland is a necessary baseline to inform moving towards a net zero health service. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland."

One of the main reasons for such incentives is the carbon sequestration capacity of biochar, which can be highly useful for countries to meet their goals of carbon emission reduction by 2030. In this regard, chemical modification of biochars has also been done to enhance their surface area and functionality, which is useful for adsorption of pollutants. However, rarely any studies are conducted to explore the effect of chemical treatment of biochar on soil cracking and water retention. The major objective of this study is to explore the crack and water retention properties of chemically modified biochar amended soil. Pig manure biochar (PMB) and peach shell biochar (PSB) with contrasting compositions were modified with H3PO4 and KOH. Soils were mixed with modified biochars at four dosages (0, 2, 5, and 8%). Crack intensity factor (CIF) and moisture content were measured during drying-wetting cycles. Results showed that H3PO4-modified biochar has been found to have a higher impact on water retention as compared to KOH-modified biochar. KOH modification instead tends to reduce hydrophilic functional groups on surface of biochar. Pig manure biochar appears to have a higher crack suppression capacity than even functional biochars. In most cases, 5–8% biochar dosage is generally found to be an optimal range for reducing cracks and improving water retention. Based on the given testing conditions, the effect of chemical modification of biochar on cracking appears to be inconclusive. It should be noted that the results in this study are based on a given testing conditions and generalization requires further studies on different types of soils. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

However, the rapid expansion and low occupancy rate could be due to the accommodation hosts’ lack of attention to the pre-interaction content while reducing their carbon footprint, which have caused a significant impact on guests’ decision-making and prevented sharing accommodation. To improve the host pre-interaction capabilities and achieve the environmentally friendly potential of sharing accommodation, this research aims to explore the host expression characteristics including important topics and keywords of host pre-interaction content from a symbolic interaction perspective. Conducting the latent Dirichlet allocation machine learning model, keywords clustering characteristics emerged as main topics based on 38,814 listings from Airbnb in Beijing. The result of investigating the features in these topics and the word distribution in three types of properties shows that in a homogenous accommodation community, hosts who make the pre-interaction have more orders than those who do not. At the same time, the focus of hosts on expressing explicit and abundant topic symbols can effectively increase the attractiveness of their listings. However, accommodation hosts who just post a long text but do not emphasize listing key topics would not convince guests to use the accommodation. A variety of practical implications of findings has been discussed for sharing accommodation practitioners to answer the challenge of sustainability. © The Author(s) 2022."

This paper takes the N2O discharged from a case study of wastewater treatment plants as the main research object, and then develops a novel algorithm, which can accurately estimate the amount of N2O release, and then applies it to the local wastewater treatment plants. According to the results, the nitrous oxide emission flux and the emission factors (EFs) are discussed. The results include the following: (1) The total amount of N2O discharged from Xiamen wastewater treatment plants between 2018 and 2019 was 3881.29 kg and 3642.97 kg, respectively; (2) the production of N2O emissions based on the total nitrogen (TN) algorithm in the existing wastewater treatment factories in Xiamen was obtained based on the research EFs; and (3) by controlling other factors of WWTPs process such as chemical oxygen demand /nitrogen (COD)/ (N) ratio, dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, pH value (the degree of concentration of hydrogen ions), and solids retention time (SRT) in the wastewater treatment process, selecting a secondary wastewater treatment process with an economical and reasonable approach can reduce N2O emissions in the wastewater treatment process. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Present study aims to provide insights in understanding physicochemical characteristics of three different rice-based cooked FW for biogas production through AD. Three FWs used for the study are vegetables with lentils (VFW), leafy vegetables (LFW), and chicken (MFW). From the results, it is observed that total solids and ash content of VFW are higher than LFW & MFW, with oxygen demand being low in VFW. Dominating Functional groups in LFW, MFW, and VFW are complex organic compounds, low-fat compounds, and less complex organic compounds, respectively. Biogas production in VFW was higher overall, followed by MFW, and least in LFW. Correlation coefficient & cluster analysis reveals the significance of oxygen demand, pH, organic carbon, and volatile solids in biogas production. VFW and MFW, being less complex undergo maximum decomposition and produce more biogas (345 and 339 ml/g VSfed, respectively). LFW with high lignocellulose content produces less biogas (182 ml/g VSfed) due to its recalcitrant nature. It is also observed that deconstruction of the complex organic matters (cellulose and lignin) results in generation of more amorphous cellulose that is easily degradable during AD process. Overall, it can be concluded that VFW and MFW are highly suitable due to high degradability and biogas production. Hence, combination of these FWs with and without pretreatment can be used for upgrading biogas generation can be carried out in future studies. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Iranian Society of Environmentalists (IRSEN) and Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University."

The treatment system consisted of an array of three boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrodes: cathode-anode-cathode. The chosen variables of interest were current density (j = 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mA cm-2), the initial Bn concentration (10, 50, and 100 mg L-1), and the volumetric flow (v = 280, 500, and 750 mL min-1). In all cases, a 0.04 M Na2SO4 and 0.05 M NaHSO4 (pH ~ 2) solution was used as the supporting electrolyte. Results indicate that, at low current densities, up to 86 % of the Bn present in the solution can be removed (j = 1.0 mA cm-2 and v = 500 mL min-1); however, additional increases in j (from 1.0 to 1.5 mA cm-2) slightly increase (2-3 %) the removal efficiency but increase 55 % the carbon footprint and the treatment cost. Likewise, increases in the volumetric flow from 500 to 750 mL min-1 marginally affect the elimination of Bn and the removal of total organic carbon (TOC) in 1% and 4 %, respectively. The highest efficiencies for TOC (68 %) and COD (82 %) removals were obtained with the following operational conditions: j = 1.0 mA cm-2 and v = 750 mL min-1. Values obtained for the instantaneous current efficiency (ICE) showed an exponential reduction, suggesting that mass transfer influences importantly the efficiency of the process. © 2023, Sociedad Química de México."

We compare the two paradigms in qualitative terms using document analysis, and we assess quantitatively how they have fared in terms of delivering progress towards sustainable development in each country. Time series data for the Sustainable Development Index and the Gini index were examined. The results show that, since ‘Living Well’ was initiated, social outcomes have continued to improve in Bolivia and, while emissions and material footprint have increased, they remain low and within or near sustainable boundaries. By contrast, South Korea has regressed in terms of sustainability. Social indicators have improved, but the Green Economy policy has failed to reduce ecological pressures. This raises significant questions about the legitimacy of the Green Economy paradigm as a model for achieving sustainable development. © 2023 The Authors.

The materials used for diesel engine components must withstand greater thermomechanical loading, as compared to gasoline engines. Thus, to determine the feasibility of using conventional aluminum-based powertrain alloys for next generation high efficiency engines, the present study evaluates the elevated temperature (250 and 300 °C) tensile and creep performance of a T7 319-type alloy. To represent real-world conditions, the 319 samples used in this study were extracted from the cylinder bridges of a sand cast engine block and then conditioned at their respective test temperatures for 200 hours. The results indicate that at 250 °C (~30–50 °C above current engine operating temperatures), the tensile strength and creep resistance of the T7 319 alloy will be able to withstand current cylinder pressures (i.e., 22 MPa) and may allow for an increase up to 30–35 MPa. However, at 300 °C, the strength decreases by more than 50% and tertiary creep initiates at 40 MPa. As such, the inherent evolution of residual stress during current engine block manufacturing technologies prevents the safe use of the 319 alloy in engine applications operating at 300 °C. © 2023, American Foundry Society."

Currently, there is no published offshore carbon footprint study, and the carbon footprint of unmanned offshore platforms in Indonesia remains unclear. This study aims to identify the potential carbon footprint of offshore platforms in the Madura Field during offshore production based on the data activity using the life cycle approach. The data inventory had been monitored for a one-year natural gas production cycle from four unmanned platforms and one processing platform in Madura Field. The results show that the unmanned offshore platforms generated an average of 98.77 kg CO2eq/GJ with a high deviation (± 3.34). The processing platform’s average carbon footprint is 1232 kg CO2eq/GJ, which indicates the wide carbon footprint range between production platforms. Carbon footprint in the offshore platform is essential for completing the cradle to grave footprint identification since it is one of the important environmental sustainable indicators used as environmental evaluation tools. Understanding the footprint level in the upstream petroleum industry is significant for studying climate change’s impact on offshore activity, potential carbon generation released to the environment, and the key step of establishing a carbon reduction plan for the petroleum industry. Therefore, climate sustainability evaluation in the upstream petroleum industry can be assessed continuously. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."

Battery electric vehicles (BEVs), hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are a few currently available examples of vehicle electrification. EVs have zero in-use emissions, however, depending on the region to be operated, well-to-wheel (WTW) emissions need to be considered for a realistic carbon footprint effect considering global warming (GW) analysis. Especially, considering the countries where the usage of renewable energy (RE) sources is extremely limited, such as Kuwait and other GCC countries, the benefit of EVs significantly decreases. Within this perspective in this study, an inclusive CO2 emissions analysis for two passenger segment vehicles with different prime movers are analyzed: ICE and electric motor (EM). Longitudinal vehicle models were developed via MATLAB/Simulink software for both prime mover configurations which are capable of simulating the fuel/energy consumption using Toyota Camry and Lexus UX 300e vehicles. The generated CO2 emissions by the two prime movers were compared using the previously generated Kuwait driving cycle (Kuwait DC). The results indicated that the use of BEVs generate fewer CO2 emissions nearly half the amount of what ICE propelled vehicles generate. © 2023 THE AUTHORS"

Moreover, previous studies mostly focused on the axial response of glass fiber reinforced polymer (glass-FRP) concrete compressive elements without determining the effectiveness of repairing them after their partial damage. The goal of this study is to assess the structural effectiveness of partially damaged GC columns that have been restored using carbon fiber reinforced polymer (carbon-FRP). Bars made of glass-FRP and helix made of glass-FRP are used to reinforce these columns. For comparative study, six of the twelve circular specimens-each measuring 300 mm×1200 mm-are reinforced with steel bars, while the other four are axially strengthened using glass-FRP bars (referred to as GSG columns). The broken columns are repaired and strengthened using carbon-FRP sheets after the specimens have been subjected to concentric and eccentric compression until a 30% loss in axial strength is attained in the post-peak phase. The study investigates the effects of various variables on important response metrics like axial strength, axial deflection, load-deflection response, stiffness index, strength index, ductility index, and damage response. These variables include concentric and eccentric compression, helix pitch, steel bars, carbon-FRP wrapping, and glass-FRP bars. Both before and after the quick repair process, these metrics are evaluated. The results of the investigation show that the axial strengths of the reconstructed SSG and GSG columns are, respectively, 15.3% and 20.9% higher than those of their original counterparts. In addition, compared to their SSG counterparts, the repaired GSG samples exhibit an improvement in average ductility indices of 2.92% and a drop in average stiffness indices of 3.2%.

This study explores the reinforcement potential of pre-treated recycled nylon fiber (NF) with CaCl2, NaOH and silane in a polypropylene (PP) matrix. Silane coating over the fiber surface was confirmed from FTIR and surface morphology. Interfacial interactions among NF and PP were further strengthened by adding nano-structured cetrimonium bromide (CTAB) treated fly ash (FA). A positive hybridization effect of FA was observed on such hybrid composites, apparent from an increment of ∼29% in tensile, ∼49% in flexural, and ∼970% in notched Izod impact strength. FE-SEM analysis showed good dispersion and distribution of reinforcements into the base matrix, establishing excellent interfacial adhesion. DSC analysis showed an increase in crystallization temperature (∼125°C) and a decrease in melting temperature of all the composites, while TGA confirms a reduction in the activation energy of all the composites. © The Author(s) 2022."

Polymers soil stabilizers have proven to be effective towards improving the strength of marginal soil. Despite this significant improvement, certain polymers are susceptible to the action of wetting, which results in a loss in strength. Thus, this study aims to investigate the mechanical properties and the durability of polymer-modified dune sand. Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) polymer was used as the soil stabilizer in varying concentrations of 3, 6, 9, and 12%. The efficacy of the polymer was evaluated by conducting unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and direct shear tests. The durability test was divided into two categories: constant soaking and cyclic wetting–drying. Changes in the morphology of the sand as a result of polymer inclusion were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The result showed that the UCS, shear strength and cohesion increased with polymer concentrations, while the frictional angle did not change significantly. The polymer-modified sand specimens lost about 60–75% of their strength after being submerged in water for 7–21 days. However, there was no reduction in strength for specimens subjected to 3 and 7 wetting–drying cycles. The action of drying following each wetting cycle reactivated the bond properties of the PVDF polymer. SEM confirmed the presence of the polymer links between the sand grains after constantly soaking. The loss of strength, in this case, can be linked to the presence of water molecules within the structure of the polymer-sand matrix. In conclusion, the PVDF polymer exhibits potential as an effective stabilizer against water susceptibility and elevated temperature. © 2023, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals."

Roasting is particularly critical, making cocoa nibs porous and brittle. In this study, the degree of disruption of the microstructure of cocoa nibs, and the quality and aroma profile of cocoa butter, were evaluated using two roasting techniques, forced convective oven, and fluidized bed. Fluidized bed roasting, recognized for its energy efficiency and low-carbon footprint, was 12 times faster than oven roasting. This technique allowed a rapid release of steam when parenchyma cell walls were still in a glassy state, while oven roasting caused gradual physical modification allowing the cell wall to become more elastic. Consequently, small pores expanded and coalesced to produce larger pores. X-ray tomographic analysis showed a total porosity in unroasted cocoa nibs of 8.5 ± 2.0% (vol/vol), which was doubled upon oven roasting and triplicated upon fluidized bed roasting. The higher porosity in fluidized-bed-roasted nibs was reflected in the lowest densities and highest cocoa butter yield. Cocoa butter obtained from fluidized-bed roasted cocoa showed a higher presence of pyrazines and 3-methylbutanal, and a lower concentration of hydroperoxides, thus enhancing the chocolate flavor and quality. In this paper, we proved that the pore structure of cocoa nibs is a key quality descriptor of roasting processing, and we concluded by quality considerations that fluidized bed roasting technique should be preferred for cocoa nibs roasting over conventional roasting. © 2023 The Authors.

Nonetheless, due to recent concerns over the availability of certain precursors used AAMs (such as the reduction of coal fly ash availability), this study utilized marble powder in various quantities to replace the naturally available kaolin as precursor. This composite use of natural precursors has been entertained to assimilate the production of carbon zero AAMs. To evaluate the physico-mechanical and microstructural characteristics of the materials, 48 mixes with different sodium (Na) concentrations, curing temperatures, and marble powder content have been used. The results show that rising curing temperature is more effective than other variables, such as the Na and marble powder content on the physico-mechanical performance of tested geopolymers. In this regard, it is found that a very high Na content can have adverse effect on the properties, potentially due to altered Na/Si, Na/Al ratio in the mixes. Furthermore, the inclusion of marble powder is found to be effective in decreasing the overall porosity up to ~31% and enhancing the physico-mechanical properties of the specimens cured at 20 and 80°C. Nonetheless, results show that when specimens containing marble powder are exposed to higher curing temperatures (above 80°C) the presence of marble powder adversely affects physico-mechanical properties. It is concluded that this phenomenon is caused by the dehydration of chemically bound water in higher temperatures when marble powder is used. This result is further confirmed by microstructural tests. © 2022 The Authors. Structural Concrete published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of International Federation for Structural Concrete."

This will directly lead to not only a significant increase in energy consumption but also the overall operational cost and carbon footprint. An energy provision based on renewable energy generation to power these small cell base stations is considered a sustainable and promising solution to address this challenge. This paper exploits the cost-effective and low-carbon energy provision solution for individual small-cell mobile networks and presents two different potential frameworks, i.e., centralized and distributed energy provision, respectively. The former supplies nearby small cell base stations through a centralized renewable energy source with energy storage facilities. For the latter, small cell base stations can be supplied by utilizing local renewable energy and storage facilities. These two frameworks are assessed and compared in terms of renewable energy utilization and carbon emission reduction in the presence of time-varying traffic loads, small cell locations and renewable energy availabilities. In addition, we devise energy management for these configurations by incorporating a resource-on-demand strategy in the proposed framework. The numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed centralized renewable energy generation strategy for nearby small cells maximizes the cost and energy efficiencies of the network.  © 2016 IEEE."

Their operation partly contributes to food waste and carbon footprint. However, the volume of these parameters fluctuated throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, there is a need to diversify the food waste data of foodservice establishments in Malaysia, across different regions and cultures. Therefore, we conducted an environmental assessment of ten cafés in two of Malaysia’s cafe hot spots, Sungai Petani and Bandar Baru Bangi, to determine their food waste (preparation loss and plate loss) and carbon footprint generation in a week when the COVID-19 restrictions were relaxed. Data on carbon footprint were collected by reading the electricity and water meters and calculated using emission factors. Sungai Petani generated substantially more food waste (77.68 % in total, equivalent to 93.04 kg) than Bandar Baru Bangi (22.32 %, equivalent to 26.73 kg), as revealed by material flow and descriptive analyses. Similarly, the carbon footprint from water consumption in Sungai Petani was 1.03 kgCO2 e, generated from 3m3 water consumption, whereas Bandar Baru Bangi produced 0.82 kgCO2 e of carbon footprint from 2.39 m3 water consumed, both districts on a Sunday. Contrarily, the carbon footprint related to the electricity usage in both locations was comparable. The largest amount of carbon footprint produced in Sungai Petani was on Sunday, while Saturday showed the highest carbon footprint in Bandar Baru Bangi. These findings will help the future redirection of Malaysia cafés’ management towards more sustainable practices, which can be enhanced with the help of information on customer footfall. © 2023, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya.

Carbon-cutting measures have been proposed to reduce global warming by 2 °C, bringing it back to preindustrial levels. There are several options on hand to meet the need for carbon reduction on a global basis, and one such option refers to CO2 sequestration via the photosynthesis of macroalgae. Species of the green seaweed Ulva are ubiquitous throughout the world oceans; they can maintain fast growth during most seasons thanks to their unique photosynthetic capacity combined with high nitrogen and phosphorous uptake rates. High commodity productions of seaweeds, such as green species of Ulva, can also deliver important additional benefits and ecosystem services, including human food, animal feed, proteins, minerals, or active natural molecules, therefore alleviating human needs shortly. Still, whether seaweeds, in general, can trap CO2 for long periods (100 years) is controversial. Technical and biological gaps need to be resolved before an effective and sustainable seaweed-based mass production intended for the sequestration of CO2 is established. This study elaborates on the potential global use of seaweeds in sequestering carbon and addresses the efficient inorganic carbon uptake and fixation traits of Ulva species. This study also overviews the photosynthetic traits and growth of seaweeds in offshore, semi-controlled, and land-based cultivation settings, focusing on total carbon budgets and footprints for Ulva sp. from the Israeli Mediterranean Sea. Altogether this work addresses the potential use of Ulva sp. as a valuable tool to moderate climate changes. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."

Mobility needs are continuously growing with increase in population. All these factors will lead to an upsurge in the energy demand for the mobility in the very next future. Consequently, the diversification of low carbon energy sources is urgently required. Hydrogen can be used for mobility solution in its two energy conversion mechanisms: The Fuel Cell technology or the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE). The latter option, studied in the present work, offers the advantages of current fossil fuel engines – existing and proven technology, lifetime, controlled cost – with a very low carbon footprint. The overall objective of the study is to define the specifications of a dedicated Hydrogen direct injection combustion system for ground transportation application with the best fuel efficiency and lower raw emissions, to minimize the aftertreatment needs. A complete experimental and numerical study was carried out to get valuable information on various phenomena occurring throughout the engine cycle. The very first step of the study consisted in performing experimental investigations. For this purpose, an all metal single cylinder engine originally designed for gasoline spark ignited combustion (tumble air motion, gasoline direct injection) was modified for hydrogen direct injection combustion. The gas-gas injection was experimentally studied in the High Pressure/High Temperature vessel available at IFPEN. Those experiments were used to calibrate the 3D CFD numerical approach. Based on a 0D pre-study (boundary conditions) and using the injection modeling calibration introduced before, 3D CFD simulations have been then carried out with specific hydrogen kinetics properties. Finally, this comprehensive study highlights the specificities of ICE running with hydrogen. It provides indications and guidelines for further developments and optimization of hydrogen combustion engines. © IMechE 2023."

As an emerging strategic industry, it has guided the direction for promoting the transformation and upgrading of traditional industries, leading to a new pole of economic growth and promoting the green development of industries. From the point of view of the carbon footprint, this study calculated the carbon emission of the civil nuclear technology application industry according to the basic accounting content of life cycle analysis (LCA). The minima, maxima and means of the carbon emission status of China (excluding Tibet, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan) from 2000 to 2019 were calculated using SPSS Software, and the carbon dioxide emissions were calculated by the Min-Max normalization method. We then compared the carbon emissions of each type of energy consumed by the civil nuclear industry with the carbon emissions of each of the carbon emission status of China. This comparison showed that the total emission of the civil nuclear technology application industry is small over its whole life cycle, but its output value is relatively large, so it is an environmentally-friendly industry which conforms to the trend of low-carbon development, clean production and green development. These features are in line with the requirements of economic development, so it is conducive to promoting the achievement of carbon peak carbon neutrality. In view of this, in order to further promote the development of the civil nuclear technology application industry, all departments should have a unified understanding, set up a special working coordination mechanism, actively seek the relevant policy support from their superiors, give full play to their own ad-vantages and conduct regular inspections. In addition, we will put in place systems and policies to attract more and better projects, increase the number and improve the quality of projects, promote the “Inner Circle” development of the civil nuclear technology application industry, and expand overseas markets, in order to create an “Outer circu-lation” highland. © 2023, Editorial office of Journal of Resources and Ecology.

Bacterioruberin is a C50 carotenoid produced by haloarchaea that possesses interesting antioxidant properties and bioactivities relevant to the food and cosmetic industries. As a substitute for the conventional organic solvents used in the extraction of nonpolar pigments, natural and biocompatible hydrophobic eutectic solvents (HES) based on the mixture of menthol with carboxylic acids were investigated for the extraction of bacterioruberin. Seven HES systems were screened both as neat solvents and in the presence of water. The menthol and levulinic acid mixture displayed a 4-fold improvement over both the ethanol control and the other HES, due to the dual action of its components. Additionally, the recovery of proteins could be achieved by the addition of water to the extract, resulting in a three-phase partition system and the formation of a protein-rich interfacial precipitate. The process intensification was assessed through the reuse of the eutectic phase over five successive extraction cycles, achieving a bacterioruberin-rich extract of 2.13 mgbacterioruberin mLHES-1. Finally, the carbon footprint of the process was determined. The results highlight the potential of HES as biocompatible solvents for the recovery of value-added compounds from marine biomass, while the use of three-phase partition allows the recovery of proteins producing a second product stream. © 2023 The Authors.

However, pastoralists dominate cattle production in sub-Saharan Africa, and their output is dependent on the availability of fodder from grasslands in rain-fed systems, which makes cattle production more vulnerable to climate change and environmental degradation. However, evidence of climate change impacts on cattle production in the region is scarce. Also, studies on the effects of environmental quality on cattle production using superior proxies (such as ecological and carbon footprints, and grazing land) rather than carbon dioxide emissions are rare. The effects of climatic factors (such as temperature and precipitation) and environmental quality measures (such as ecological and carbon footprints and grazing land) on cattle production in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, were studied. Other covariates such as cattle share of total livestock population and cattle unit per agricultural land were also considered in the study. Time-series data from 1971 to 2018 were obtained from the Food and Agriculture Organization statistical database, World Bank Climate Change Knowledge Portal, and Global Footprint Network. Using autoregressive distributed lag model to analyze the data, the paper found that carbon footprint, ecological footprint, grazing area, rainfall, cattle share of total livestock population, and cattle unit per agricultural land all have long-term effects on cattle production in Nigeria. Under the current climate change and environmental degradation regime, appropriate policy measures for effective and efficient cattle production were recommended. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Iranian Society of Environmentalists (IRSEN) and Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University."

However, regulations on cross-ownership within green supply chains are still in their early stages of development. Cross-ownership affects both the government’s pricing strategy and its carbon reduction policies. Additionally, the cross-shareholding structure impacts the profitability of the supply chain by introducing power dynamics between manufacturers and retailers. When cross-shareholding regulations and models are implemented, manufacturers and retailers within the supply chain exhibit more substantial reductions in their carbon footprint and experience increased profits, particularly in decentralized supply chains when cross-ownership surpasses a specific threshold. The adoption of cross-shareholding profit-sharing agreements could enhance the performance of green supply chains. This article synthesizes the views of scholars on cross-shareholding in the supply chain. It uses analytical methods to evaluate the role of the negotiation process, trade credit, and cross-shareholding in the supply chain. The article uses jurisprudence to recommend a cross-shareholding policy in the Philippines to enhance supply chain efficiency. It uses the “Stackelberg Leadership Model” to analyze the impact of cross-shareholding on two levels of the supply chain, offering recommendations for future implementation to improve supply chain efficiency. The article recommends that the Philippines’ supply chain policy include mechanisms to encourage new companies to join the existing cross-ownership network, capitalize on the impact of cross-shareholding on supply chain assessment, and develop ways to use equity ratio and trade credit. These recommendations aim to refine policy and legislation in the Philippines to effectively utilize trade credit, equity ratios, and cross-shareholdings in supply chain management. © 2023, University of Southeastern Philippines.

Due to COVID-19, which spreads rapidly and causes death, countries have taken their own pandemic measures. The first case of COVID-19 was seen in Turkey on March 11, 2020, and on the same day, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Turkey has implemented measures such as full closure and partial closure throughout the country in certain periods during the pandemic process. These measures have increased the time people spend at home and have led to differences in their general lifestyles. These differences have caused various effects, especially on ecological carrying capacity, as well as the changes in the world's economic and social consumption habits (electricity, heating, transportation, etc.). It is observed that the changing human habits due to the pandemic are effective in ecological developments, in cities having cleaner air and environment, and in the positive renewal of natural life. One of the most important components of the ecological footprint, which is used to make ecological differences measurable and comparable, is the carbon footprint. In this study, the individual change in the carbon footprint is discussed and the positive environmental changes in Turkey are questioned in relation to individual human activities. The study comparatively examines pre-COVID-19 (before 1 March 2020) and post-COVID-19 (after 1 March 2020) in terms of individual carbon footprint. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."

The CDR potentials of ERW have been assessed at the process and national/global levels, but the environmental and economic implications of ERW have not been fully quantified for U.S. applications with real-world supply chain considerations. This study develops an optimization-based, integrated life cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis framework for ERW, which is demonstrated by a case study applying mining waste to croplands in the Midwestern U.S. The case study explores maximum transportation distances for intermodal transportation at varied mineral CDR yields and costs, informing supply chain design for economically viable ERW. ERW costs (US$45 to 472/tonne of net CO2e captured) and cradle-to-farm gate GHG emissions (41 to 359 kg CO2e/tonne of CO2e captured) are estimated based on a range of CDR yields and by transportation distances to and from two Midwest port destinations: Chicago and Duluth. Our sensitivity analysis identifies CDR yields, and transportation modes and distances as driving factors for result variations. Our study reveals the importance of ERW supply chain design and provides an example of U.S. CDR implementation. Our framework and findings can be applied to other regional ERW projects. © 2023 American Chemical Society."

Approximately 20% to 70% of waste is produced by operating rooms, and very few of this waste is recycled. The purpose of this study is to quantify the opened but unused disposable supplies and generate strategies to reduce disposable waste. Methods: A single-center prospective study to evaluate the cost of opened but unused single-use operating room supplies was completed by counting the number of wasted disposable products at the end of hand surgery cases. We used χ2 test, t test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and simple linear regression to assess the associations between patient and case variables and the total cost of wasted items. Environmentally Extended Input Output Life Cycle Assessment methods were used to convert the dollar spent to kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-e), a measure of greenhouse gas emissions. Results: Surgical and dressing items that were disposed of and not used during each case were recorded. We included 85 consecutive cases in the analysis from a single surgeon’s practice. Higher cost from wasted items was associated with shorter operative time (P =.010). On average, 11.5 items were wasted per case (SD: 3.6 items), with a total of 981 items wasted over the 85 cases in the study period. Surgical sponges and blades were 2 of the most unused items. Wasted items amounted to a total of $2193.5 and 441 kg of CO2-e during the study period. Conclusions: This study highlights the excessive waste of unused disposable products during hand surgery cases and identifies ways of improvement. © The Author(s) 2022."

However, most passive devices are static and monofunctional, and cannot meet the practical requirements of dynamic cooling and heating under various conditions. Here, we demonstrate a smart thermal-gated (STG) bilayer membrane that enables fully automatic and temperature-adaptive radiative cooling and solar heating. Specifically, this device can switch from reflective to absorptive (white to black) in the solar wavelength with the reduction in optical scattering upon ambient temperature, corresponding to a sunlight reflectivity change from 0.962 to 0.059 when the temperature drops below ∼30 °C, whereas its mid-infrared emissivity remains at ∼0.95. Consequently, this STG membrane achieves a temperature of ∼5 °C below ambient (a key signature of radiative cooling) under direct sunlight (peak solar irradiance >900 W m−2) in summer and a solar heating power of ∼550 W m−2 in winter. Theoretical analysis reveals the substantial advantage of this switchable cooling/heating device in potential energy saving compared with cooling-only and heating-only strategies when widely used in different climates. It is expected that this work will pave a new pathway for designing temperature-adaptive devices with zero energy consumption and provide an innovative way to achieve sustainable energy. © 2023 Science China Press"

Meanwhile, this paper applies the ARIMA model to predict China’s energy ecological footprint. The results show that the per capita energy ecological footprint continues to rise and the per capita energy biocapacity continues to decline. In 2010, the growth of China’s energy ecological footprint exceeds energy biocapacity for the first time and becomes an unsustainable state. Energy ecological footprint efficiency continues to increase and is in an ecological deficit and economically developed zone after 2010. From a structural point of view, China’s energy ecological footprint mainly consists of row coal, coke, and crude oil consumption. The main reason for the increase in energy ecological footprint is the rapid increase in row coal and crude oil consumption while energy efficiency can mitigate this impact. From 2020 to 2030, China’s energy ecological footprint will increase from 1.2207 to 1.3573 ha/cap. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Iranian Society of Environmentalists (IRSEN) and Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University."

The presence of even small concentrations of impurities in biogas influences its properties at different levels. The effect of the individual component species on the biogas upgrading performance has not been fully evaluated and closely understood. In this work, biogas component species, including the typical binary biogas mixture (CH4/CO2) and one impurity with maximum concentration, flowing over silica gel bed are modelled and analyzed to study their effects on the biogas upgrading process. The model is built using Aspen Adsorption™ and Aspen Hysys version 10 and validated using experimental data reported previously. The effect of each component species is reported, and the deviation from the typical binary biogas mixture is marked. From our analyses, the presence of all the component species causes an adverse implication on the biogas upgrading performance. The presence of 20% nitrogen, for example, brings about the highest increase in viscosity and density of the biogas mixture, resulting in the highest friction factor between gas molecules and bed surface. Ten percent of moisture content causes the highest pressure drop during adsorption. Interestingly, 5% oxygen, 3% hydrogen, and 1% ammonia enhance the recovery of methane by 1.48%, 0.93%, and 0.56%, respectively. This study can be used to predict the biogas mixing behavior during the biomethane upgrading using pressure swing adsorption. The proposed model possesses a great competence for making prediction of biomethane upgrading performance of PSA process with impressive ability to disclose the influence of the common impurities on upgrading performance and biogas properties.

Consequently, it is important to the composites sector, particularly for Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) filament manufacturers as a material selection tool when determining the usability of recycled material utilised in component design phases. This article investigates the LCA framework of utilising wood dust as reinforced material and recycled polypropylene material in the production of composite filament for the FDM sector. Eco Audit, a feature of the CES Edupack programme, was utilised to evaluate the LCA from an environmental standpoint for product makers. Using recycled polypropylene containing an increasing weight percentage of wood dust to produce new types of composite filament materials reduces energy consumption (MJ) and lowers the carbon footprint (kg). This is because the quantity of energy required for recycling is far less than that required for initial manufacture. When compared to the new polypropylene material that is used to create filament, this study reveals a 56% and 37% reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emissions, respectively. This is a considerable improvement from an environmental point of view. © Penerbit UMT"

However, peat mining produces a negative carbon footprint, which raises the need for alternative sustainable substrate media. To address this, we studied the impact of peat replacement with a combination of various biochars and cotton burr compost on the growth and yield of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.), and nutrient concentration of media, plant leaf, and fruit in greenhouse conditions. Two experiments were conducted from Nov 2020 through Jan 2021 (Trial 1) and from Feb to Apr 2021 (Trial 2). The treatments were control (peat, vermiculite, and perlite at 2:1:1) and in the control peat was either fully replaced (hardwood biochar+ compost, softwood biochar+compost, and hemp biochar+compost) or partially replaced up to 50% (v/v) (hardwood biochar+compost, softwood biochar+compost, and hemp biochar+ compost). The control media was more acidic with lowest electrical conductivity than the other treatments. The leaf chlorophyll content and the photosynthetic assimilation rate varied among the treatments in both trials. The final dry shoot biomass was lowest in peatdominated control treatment suggesting biochar-compost in the substrate media contributed in increased dry biomass of the cucumber plant. The total number of fruits per plant and total yield per plant was significantly increased in all the treatments with the highest in hardwood biochar+compost, compared with the control. The nutrient concentration of media, leaf, and fruit indicates that biochar-compost enhances the nutritional status of the media, which supplies essential nutrients to the plant leaf and fruit while growing in different substrate compositions. Our results suggest that the replacement of peat with full or partial proportions of biochar-compost can produce similar and, in some cases, even better growth, yield, and physiology in potted cucumber than in the unamended control treatment. © 2023 American Society for Horticultural Science.

In the last years a widespread interest on hydrogen has grown as energy vector for the decarbonization of multiple sectors, including industry, transport and buildings. Nevertheless, the impact of natural gas and other fossil fuels substitution with hydrogen is highly affected by the mix of different technologies and energy sources applied for hydrogen generation. The paper aims to investigate current CO2 emissions related with hydrogen generation in Australia and Italy by means of PEM and alkaline technologies; and to evaluate the potential impact considering cell characteristics variation and 3 scenarios based on energy mix. A sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the critical parameters. Based on experimental data, the energy consumption for hydrogen production using PEM technology is more sensitive to cell voltage compared to current density, which indicates the importance of cell manufacturing and electrolyte resistance. In addition, by performing sensitivity analysis regarding energy sources scenarios it is found that carbon dioxide emission in Australia is more sensitive to renewable energy sources rather than Italy. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC"

By integrating these replacement cementitious materials, this approach aims to optimize fresh properties and enhance the environmental friendliness of concrete structures. Fly ash, a by-product of coal combustion, and silica fume, a waste product from silicon metal and ferrosilicon alloy production, are used as sustainable alternatives to traditional cement. During the study the main mechanical properties, in fresh state, were assessed. The 3D printable concrete control compositions have a percentage between 55% and 75% sand, 45% and 25% cement, 1.5% superplasticizer and 0.5% VMA and for the 3D printable eco-concrete the percentage of cement was replace with 20% fly ash and 10% silica fume. The results had shown a decrease in bulk density for the eco-concrete 3D printed specimens between 3.3% and 2.5%, and as a requirement for 3D printed concrete, the compositions need to have little to no flow after it is extruded, for the slump flow test and jump table test mix CSTAMIX6 and CSTBMIX4 showed the best results in terms of buildability of the printed layer which can support its own weight and the weight of the superior layers. This utilization not only reduces the carbon footprint associated with concrete production but also improves material optimization by enhancing strength, durability, and workability. The combination of 3D printing technology and ecofriendly materials allows for precise and intricate designs while ensuring sustainability in the construction industry.

Recognizing the importance of enhancing their performance, most businesses within creative industries have come to realize the necessity of major changes in their business models, with a focus on the environment. Nowadays, the adoption of an ""open sustainability innovation"" approach is a source of strategic advantage for companies, this approach combining elements of sustainability, innovation, and collaboration with external partners to address environmental and social challenges. Such approach in the creative industries can also play a crucial role in driving sustainability and innovation while reducing the environment footprint of creative endeavors. By engaging with their audiences and consumers in co-creating sustainable products, its not only about fostering a sense of ownership but also its about ensuring that the final products or services meet the environmental expectations of target audience. Through open innovation, creative industries can discover new ways to reduce waste in production processes, use eco-friendly materials, and minimize their carbon footprint. Thus, by embracing collaboration, diversity, and a commitment to evinronmentally friendly practices, in their turn, creative industries can also contribute to a more sustainable and eco-conscious future. In this context, there is a growing demand for international research that provides exemplary practices and successful business models to emulate. To address this requirement, the authors have proposed a comprehensive conceptual model as the initial foundation. The primary objective is to subject this conceptual model to further scrutiny within creative ecosystems to ascertain the impact of an open innovation approach on its performance. By investigating these dimensions, this paper seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of open innovation's influence on creative industries and provide actionable insights for practitioners and policymakers alike. © 2023 Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Romania.

Especially the biomass energy potential of the Central Anatolia region of Turkey is over 8 billion kWh. However, annual bioethanol and biodiesel production amounts are low in Turkey. Moss with high energy density is an important biomass energy source candidate for Turkey, which is surrounded by seas on three sides. New factories to be established in the southeastern part of the Marmara region, which has a high biomass energy potential, should be established in regions with low energy potential. Contrary to EU countries, heat generation from urban waste has started in Turkey since 2015. Therefore, the waste collection approach should be expanded. As in the example of UK, the importance of determining the necessary incentives in Turkey's energy crop cultivation has been demonstrated. Within the scope of forestry activities in Turkey, 25% of the forest-derived material remains in the forest. In this study, the importance of converting this material into biogas or evaluating it as wood pellets was emphasized. This study will make a positive contribution to the increase of domestic production in Turkey, to provide cheaper energy supply, to reduce dependency on foreign countries in energy demand, to increase employment, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and carbon footprint. © (2023), (International Journal of Renewable Energy Research).

To this end, the authors have analyzed a system of indicators reflecting progress in achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals in the context of transitioning to a low-carbon economy. As part of the study, additional indicators are proposed and partially calculated for inclusion in the system (such as the carbon footprint of use and production in Russia in order to use the net carbon export indicator). CO2 emissions contained in manufactured goods and implicit in exports are calculated on the basis of an input–output model. In addition, the indicators of carbon dioxide absorption by forests in the regions of the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation are considered. This indicator is obtained on the basis of conversion–volumetric coefficients in the context of age groups. The experience of China and Germany in the develpment of renewable energy is considered, an analysis of the energy intensity indicators of regions of Russia is conducted, indicators of the absorption of greenhouse gases by forests are calculated, and proposals are made to improve the indicators of low-carbon development. The study reveals a significant gap between produced and consumed carbon dioxide emissions, which is determined by the large export of carbon emissions, while the volume of carbon emissions from the forests of the Russian Arctic is 168.8 million t of CO2 per year. The proposed system of indicators of the transition to low-carbon development for various levels complements the known indicators of the low-carbon segment of the Sustainable Development Goals with relevant indicators, such as an increase in electricity production from renewable sources, the share of public transport running on batteries, and carbon absorption by ecosystems. Currently, the system includes ten indicators, representing four main areas (energy intensity, carbon intensity, introduction of cleaner energy sources, and carbon uptake by ecosystems). © 2023, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

This serves as a clear impetus for universities to transition to renewable energy technologies, which offer the advantages of cost-effective operation and minimal environmental footprint. This paper presents the design of a grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) system with battery storage to fulfil the electricity consumption needs of Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka (UTeM) main campus. The objective is to reduce grid dependency, lower electricity costs, and minimize carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The system was modelled and simulated using DIgSILENT software. Load demand and energy consumption data were extracted from the Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) electricity bill, while the PV profile and irradiance data were obtained from the UTeM solar laboratory. Based on the findings, it has been determined that a 12 MWp PV system, coupled with a 25.8 MWh battery, represents the optimal solution for satisfying the total electricity demand of UTeM's main campus. The installation of this system is projected to result in estimated monthly electricity bill savings of MYR 422,611 for UTeM. Furthermore, the proposed system offers a significant environmental benefit by potentially reducing CO2 emissions by up to 1,507,520 kg per month. The findings of this study can inform decision-makers in implementing a costeffective and environmentally friendly energy solution for UTeM's main campus. © (2023), (International Journal of Renewable Energy Research).

Unlike the commonly used single EH scheme adopted in existing works, in this considered free-space optical-radio frequency (FSO-RF) system, a dual EH mode is considered, in which an EH relay is capable of harvesting energy from both the ambient RF signal in the environment and the direct-current component separated from the FSO signal simultaneously. In addition, in this considered system, a source node plans to communicate with two users equipped with multiple antennas via an EH relay on a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) basis, and all the harvested energy of the relay is used to transmit the signal to both NOMA users. Moreover, assuming a selection-combining scheme is adopted at the user side, both the analytical and asymptotic expressions of outage probability for each NOMA user are presented, and the system performance with various atmospheric turbulence, detection technique, as well as pointing error is investigated. Finally, numerical results show that our proposed dual EH mode can lead to better outage performance than that with the single EH one.  © 2014 IEEE."

Recently, alkali activation of precursors has boomed in the market since activation of precursors improves mechanical properties and reduces the carbon footprint. However, one risk factor in alkali activation is molar concentration. This is because the increase in the molar concentration of sodium hydroxide/sodium silicate and the release of volatile substances from those acids is more harmful to the environment. Therefore, the present study investigates the activation of the precursor at low molar concentration, thereby equalising performance through the dosage of superplasticisers. In this regard, fly ash was activated at 5 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and replaced cement at varying percentages in the range of 0–30% by weight. The performance of self-consolidating concrete (SCC) was evaluated through fresh and hardened characteristics and microstructural analysis. The blended mixtures of SCC, activated fly ash (AFA) at 5 M sodium hydroxide, 0.89% of superplasticisers and 15% of replacement performed better than the control SCC. The outcome of the present study will provide a platform for activating a precursor at low molar concentration through the influence of superplasticisers. © 2023 ICE Publishing. All rights reserved."

Kern Center is a 16,940 square-foot mass timber-structured institutional building located on Hampshire College’s campus in Amherst, MA. It is the 17th certified Living Building in the world. The focus of this work is the examination of the use of Double Stud Wood Wall (DSWW) construction, an atypical system in an institutional building of this scale, Light-Frame Steel Wall (LFSW) being the typical strategy. The success of this system, in non-residential construction, with the increased internal loads as compared to residential buildings, the associated and elevated concern of high R-value walls, low temperatures at the exterior sheathing, and sub-sequent susceptibility to moisture-related problems from condensation due to mass transport and mass transfer via interior moisture migration through the assembly within low dewpoint probable temperature periods of the year is of interest. During the Kern Center’s design (September 2013–September 2014) and construction (October 2014–April 2016), although there existed a substantial body of information referencing the control of air and vapor movement as related to humidity levels within wall assemblies using assorted membranes, tapes, caulks, and gaskets, there was not a definitive solution to ensure the wall assembly’s performance and durability. In depth examination of the DSWW strategy in the Kern Center was made possible by the availability of three years of post-occupancy data collected by multiple sensors on all cardinal elevations. This allowed the evaluation of condensation risks and assembly drying potential throughout the year based on sensor data of exterior weather and interior conditioned space sensible air temperature (T), dewpoint air temperature (DP), relative humidity (RH), and absolute humidity (AH), as well as sensor data from within the assemblies, i.e., sensible and DP temperatures, RH, AH, and moisture content (MC).

The carbon footprint of the inhabitants of Cartagena varies between 0.4 and 17.6 TonEquivCO2 per year, in addition, there were no differences in terms of sex and age groups. On the other hand, the personal carbon footprint at the spatial level is relatively homogeneous, with a slight distribution of values greater than 9 TonEquivCO2 in the area where people with a lower socioeconomic status live. The results suggest the need to prioritize strategies to reduce the carbon footprint in these places.  © 2023 Juan Carlos Valdelamar-Villegas, published by Sciendo."

Natural gas-derived ethane in VCM synthesis has long been considered a transformative feedstock to lower emissions and expenses. In this work, we evaluate the environmental potential and economics of recently developed catalytic ethane chlorination technologies for VCM synthesis. We consider the ethylene-based business-as-usual (BAU) route and two different ethane-based processes evaluated at their current development level and their full potential, i.e., ideal conversion and selectivity. All routes are assessed under two temporal scenarios: present (2020) and prospective (2050). Combining process simulation and life cycle assessment (LCA), we find that catalytic ethane chlorination technologies can lower the production cost by 32% at their current development state and by 56% when considering their full potential. Though environmentally disadvantageous in the 2020 scenario, they emerge as more sustainable alternatives to the BAU in the 2050 scenario, reducing the carbon footprint of VCM synthesis by up to 26% at their current state and up to 58% at their full potential. Going beyond VCM synthesis, our results highlight prospective LCA as a powerful tool for assessing the true environmental implications of emerging technologies under more decarbonized future energy scenarios. © 2023 The Authors.

The study was conducted in January 2022. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method was applied to assess and analyze the amounts of GHG emissions and environmental costs associated with fast-food restaurants in terms of ingredients and food preparation, food delivery, and food waste transportation to the landfill. GHG emissions were divided into three categories according to the Carbon Footprint for Organization (CFO), namely: 1) direct GHG emissions from fast-food restaurants 2) indirect GHG emissions from energy consumption; and 3) indirect GHG emissions from other sources. The GHG emission hotspots in both western and Thai fast-food restaurants were identified based on two types of activities: those inside and outside the restaurants. The results from the data collected from the fast-food restaurants in the Sathorn District showed that the total GHG emission of the restaurants was 521,571.46 kgCO2 e/year. The first category of GHG emission was 20,558.63 kgCO2 e/year. The second category emitted the most GHG at 396,564.50 kgCO2 e/year. The third category of GHG emission was 111,456.48 kgCO2 e/year. The hotspots of both western and Thai restaurants originated from the same activity, which was electric energy consumption because all the restaurants used appliances and electronic devices to facilitate their business. The highest environmental cost was water treatment at 59,040.00 baht annually. This study can be utilized as a database for measurement, assessment, and management to reduce GHG emissions from fast-food restaurants, other food businesses, and other related activities. © 2023, Thai Society of Higher Eduation Institutes on Environment.

To reduce environmental pollution, this paper systematically calculates the carbon emissions of the beer supply chain and studies the optimization of carbon emissions reduction through scenario simulation. In this study, the boundary of the beer supply chain carbon emissions system is constructed. The scenario simulation and simulation analysis are carried out based on five factors: water recycling utilization rate, power generation mode, weight–volume ratio, recovery ratio, and transportation mode. To obtain the optimal scheme of economic cost and emissions reduction, the cost of the beer supply chain is analyzed under the condition of carbon trading. The results show that the proportion of carbon emissions in each link of the beer supply chain is production, packaging, transportation, and storage, which are 59.58%, 22.27%, 17.67%, and 0.5%, respectively. The improvement of the water recycling utilization rate of manufacturing enterprises can reduce the overall carbon emissions of the supply chain, and the effect is obvious. The highest proportion of carbon emissions in the packaging link is the bottle consumption stage (22.43%). Raw materials transportation accounts for the highest proportion of total carbon emissions in transportation (63.73%). The waterway/railway ratio will be increased to 0.6/0.4, and the carbon emissions in the supply chain will be reduced by 5.7%. In the context of carbon trading, when the carbon trading price is higher than 49.16 yuan/ton, enterprises can achieve a win-win situation in reducing emissions and maintaining positive economic growth by the measures given in the paper. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Measuring and optimising Operational Energy and related emissions in the use phase of buildings has entered both markets and regulations. However, the Embodied Energy within construction materials and respective maintenance and end-of-life processes is still in the research phase. Moreover, Global Warming Potential baselines per built square metre need to be defined in the construction sector, integrating operational and embodied impacts. This research has the main goal of identifying for the first time the Whole Life Carbon (WLC) emissions of the average Spanish residential buildings of the period 1981–2010, broken down into Embodied Carbon (EC) and Operational Carbon (OC). For this purpose, first, a regular average and homogenised average of existing European baselines was performed; next, the average Spanish residential building has been defined and modelled with a real sample from year 2013, and its emissions calculated as Scenario 0; and finally, five new scenarios have been compared in order to understand variations in WLC and their EC and OC contributions. This research shows for the average multifamily building apartment in Spain, with a mean net floor area of 73.1 m2, a WLC baseline of 1944 kg CO2-eq·m−2, 30.8 % (559 kg CO2-eq·m−2) being EC, and the remaining 69.2 % OC. In Scenarios 1 to 3, the following are identified: a WLC reduction of 26.0 % (9.2 % EC) by using wood window frames, 0.8 % (2.7 % EC) by laying a wood inner floor, and 16.1 % (1.0 % EC) by insulating walls with recycled cork. All three items are calculated together in Scenario 4, giving a 36.9 % WLC reduction (9.5 % EC). Finally, Scenario 5 was modelled upon Scenario 4 materials, complying with the upcoming European Energy Performance of Buildings Directive as if built in 2021, reaching a potential WLC reduction of 63.4 % (2.8 % EC) from the original Scenario 0. These figures support technical and policy trends towards minimising the impacts of buildings. Focusing on decarbonisation, targets of over 60 % appear feasible with existing market solutions. Reductions of >80 % are also derived from other impact categories, such as Ionizing Radiation, Marine Eutrophication, and Water Consumption, while Freshwater Ecotoxicity increases by 15 %. The 18 ReCiPe Midpoint indicators plus Energy Footprint, are reduced by an average of 50.4 %. © 2023 The Author(s)"

Climate change brought on by emissions of greenhouse gases exacerbates problems such as severe storms, earthquakes, epidemics, and food distribution. The group of developed and developing countries, the world’s biggest carbon emitters and most significant economies, is expertly planning to lessen its environmental challenges and contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goals 7 and 13 set by the United Nations. This study uses the novel econometric methodologies of the dynamic ordinary least square (DOLS) estimator, the augmented mean group (AMG) estimator, and the fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS) estimate to examine the influence of economic policy uncertainty, renewable energy consumption, geopolitical risk, non-renewable energy consumption, and economic growth on ecological footprint from 2000 to 2021. The results reveal that the variables are co-integrated; REC reduces carbon emissions, EPU, geopolitical risk, and economic growth contribute to increasing carbon emissions, while urbanization improves carbon emission. Finally, the results suggest that the developed and developing economies can progress toward SDGs 7 and 13 by using renewable energy, lowering the geopolitical risk, effectively handling policy uncertainty, and reducing urbanization. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

The plant mainly consists of a traditional activated sludge system along with an anaerobic digester providing a partial contribution of energy to the management. An integrated approach was adopted to evaluate the environmental sustainability of the treatment plant in terms of carbon footprint. For the assessment different sources of greenhouse gas emissions such as nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide were considered: effluent, production and transport of natural gas, energy consumption, boiler, co-generator, substrate and endogenous decays. According to the methodology adopted, energy consumption, production and transport of natural gas and N2O emissions from the effluent were found the most contributing sources of greenhouse gases. Based on this, these sources are suggested as the most relevant ones on which wastewater treatment plant managers should pay more attention when taking actions for carbon footprint mitigation. Considerations on the role of CO2 of biogenic origin (specifically the one in the biogas) in terms of sequestration options demonstrate that the analysis in this field should not be limited to the calculation and comment of non-fossil contributions to the overall balance. © 2023 The Authors"

To tackle these challenges, it is essential to identify people's awareness levels of waste handling techniques and their pro-environmental behaviors. The study focuses on Guwahati, one of the most important cities in Northeast India, which generates increasing plastic waste daily. The paper aims to identify the factors contributing to the reduction of carbon footprints resulting from plastic waste management activities. The data collected from 1326 respondents was analyzed using factor analysis, and the reliability of the dataset was confirmed using Cronbach's alpha (0.84 for the awareness level of waste management techniques and 0.780 for the prevalent mode of plastic waste management techniques). KMO (0.796), Bartlett's test of sphericity (p < 0.001), and determinant score (0.019) were used to assess the data adequacy and factorability of the dataset, and the results were found to be satisfactory. Principal component analysis, exploratory factor analysis, and varimax orthogonal rotation method were used to identify high-loaded factors by reducing the number of variables. The results showed that two highly loaded components, namely awareness level of waste management techniques (AWMT) and prevalent mode of plastic waste management techniques (PWMT), explained 27.53% and 24.34% of the total variance, respectively, with eigenvalues of 3.35 and 2.88. The regression model confirmed the statistical significance of these factors (p < 0.001) and their relationship with the dependent variable, greenhouse reduction (GHGR). The study proposes that minimizing carbon footprints in the environment can be achieved by focusing on a limited number of controllable factors such as AWMT and PWMT. This study provides valuable insights to the authorities in controlling waste generation and achieving a pollution-free environment. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC."

In recent years, research on regional nature parks and comparable protected areas has focused on questions regarding local populations’ acceptance of such areas, their governance, and their economic effects. However, we know surprisingly little about the impact of protected areas on environmental resource use and life satisfaction, two essential ingredients of sustainable regional development. In this study, we survey people living in and around three regional nature parks in Switzerland on their resource use and life satisfaction (gross sample n = 3358). We propose a novel measurement of resource use based on vignettes describing different lifestyles, which we validate against the carbon footprint obtained for a subsample of our respondents. With these indicators, using multiple regression analyses, we test several hypotheses derived from the literature on the relationship between resource use and life satisfaction in and around protected areas. Contrary to our expectations, we do not find differences in resource use or life satisfaction, or the relationship between resource use and life satisfaction, across park and non-park regions. We discuss potential explanations for our findings and their implications for nature park authorities and future study designs. © 2023, The Author(s)."

The sustainability goal in relation to EF is to reduce the impact of climate change on natural resources for long-term growth. Pakistan is a country facing an ecological deficit and has difficulty striking a balance between economic development and environmental protection worldwide. As a result of its significant role in achieving sustainability, which is essential for human life, EF has become a global phenomenon. The study considered the nexus of economic growth, EF and its subcomponents for the economy of Pakistan. The Johansen co-integration technique was used to analyse the short-run (ECM) and long-run relationship. The results showed that urbanisation, financial development, economic growth and temperature have positive effects on EFs, whereas rainfall and carbon dioxide emissions have a negative effect on EFs. The ECM test demonstrates that studied variables are responsible for 46% of disequilibrium in EF, which is less than the moderate threshold. On the contrary, in the model of EF, the coefficient of temperature in the long-run speed is negative, indicating that the system is diverging from equilibrium and correcting its prior period disequilibrium at a rate of 663% a year, while that of CO2 emissions is positive, indicating that the system is converging towards equilibrium and correcting its prior period disequilibrium at a rate of 77.2% a year. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

The basis for economic growth was said to be the shift of energy and environmental strategies toward a sustainable future. Indeed, it became a matter of proclaimed acceptance that environmental challenges nurtured expansion, innovation, and competitiveness. Climate change is the most pressing issue being faced by the world due to an increase in ecological footprint from 7.0 billion to 20.6 billion GHA. It indicates the seriousness of environmental degradation; therefore, nations need to ensure environmental sustainability. Keeping this in mind, the present research mainly aims to examine the impact of renewable energy utilization on the ecological footprints of RECAI economies, spanning the period from 1990 to 2020. To significantly achieve the research objective, we utilized panel econometric methods for empirical analysis. The results of long-run elasticities indicate that both renewable energy utilization as well as trade openness significantly controls the ecological footprints, while higher conventional energy utilization and economic growth significantly impede environmental sustainability. The empirical findings provide new insights for policymakers on renewable energy for the betterment of environmental quality in RECAI countries. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

The STES data reduction capability is analyzed in terms of mean square error (mse). The reduction in misadjustment based on estimation error enables the improvement in data reduction capability of the system. Depending on the desired reliability (DR), when the estimation error is above the DR, the corresponding input data are utilized to enhance the system's tracking ability. The effect of system length and real-time step size constant on data transmission reduction has been studied. Simulation results validate that the amount of data transmission reduction improves when the system reliability is reduced and vice versa. The STES allows nodes to reduce transmissions by 96.95%, whereas state-of-the-art systems such as adaptive method for data reduction (AM-DR) and optimal step size least mean square (OSSLMS) achieve reductions of 93.05% and 88.7%, respectively, for DR of 0.5°C.

Herein, novel synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) using natural surfactants and sequential investigation of their optical, physicochemical and photocatalytic properties are conducted. This work utilizes β-cyclodextrin (βCD) and honey as surfactants during the production process. It is demonstrated that these natural surfactants have the ability to control size, shape, crystalline phase growth and dispersion of NPs (denoted as ZnO-C and ZnO-H). Subsequent coupling of ZnO NPs with Ag to form the binary nanostructures (ZnO-xAg, ZnO-C-xAg and ZnO-H-xAg) further assists controlling their physicochemical properties. With a variation of Ag NPs loading, the 3 wt% Ag loaded nanophotocatalysts were more efficient and their associated properties were revealed by various characterization techniques. Nanoparticles of different shapes were fabricated with a surface area of up to 10 m2.g−1 and crystalline sizes of 9.38 nm. Photoluminescent spectroscopy indicated that Ag nanoparticles enhanced the life span of electron-hole pairs. Thus, photodegradation of bromophenol blue (BPB) indicated enhanced NPs photoactivity upon modification with CD, honey, and Ag NPs. BPB photodegradation was > 99.84% using ZnO-H-3Ag with reaction rates of k0app=518.8×10−2min−1 and up to 75% total organic carbon was removed by ZnO-H-3Ag at a rate of 8.19×10−3min−1. © 2023 Institution of Chemical Engineers"

A panel data framework that considers cross-sectional dependence and heterogeneity was used for analysis. The Pedroni and Johnsen Fisher cointegration showed that carbon emission, ecological footprint, renewable and non-renewable energy consumption, economic complexity, globalization, and urbanization confirmed the presence of cointegration. Moreover, fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) and dynamic ordinary least squares (DLOS) indicated that globalization, non-renewable energy consumption, and economic complexity increase emission and ecological footprint in the long run, whereas renewable energy generated through biomass, solar, and wind decreases environmental degradation. Furthermore, urbanization also negatively affects the environment. From a policy perspective, policymakers in these countries may manage their natural resources efficiently by escalating the share of renewables in total energy production, offering tax holidays, incentives and encouraging companies to install clean energy plant, and providing support to research and development-oriented companies to engage in research activities to reduce the cost of production of renewable energy. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Despite its potential, there are still significant challenges that hinder the effective utilization of RPB technology in process intensification. Specifically, the hydraulics of liquid and gas phases within RPB packings present a significant challenge. In this study, 2D – VOF approach is employed to study the behavior of liquid droplets impacting on single rotating wire and on a whole rotating wire mesh within a Rotating Packed Bed (RPB). A comprehensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is developed to analyze the influence of rotating speed, liquid velocity, and droplet diameter on the dynamics of liquid droplets. The boundaries of splashing – no splashing and dripping – capture breakup modes were validated for a single rotating wire and identified for wire mesh in RPBs by constructing the corresponding regime maps. This is achieved thanks to a new data processing algorithm that applies the principle of neighborhood aggregation. The proposed data processing algorithm helps reconstruct the regime maps for the various breakup phenomena within RPBs. The results show that the splashing mechanism reproduces higher-velocity detached daughter droplets, while the momentum-induced dripping mechanism results in low velocity daughter droplets. The results also reveal that the deposited liquid film with the wires has a key role in enhancing the splashing phenomena in RPBs. The radial distribution of diameter and velocity of liquid droplets in RPB is also analyzed in light of the droplet impact dynamics. The increase in the average liquid velocity with radial direction was attributed to the increase of splashed drops, which led to a bigger number of high-velocity droplets. The conclusions of this study can be used to help improve the dynamics of the two-phase flow within RPBs through a better packing design and flow conditions. © 2023 Institution of Chemical Engineers"
1067,Scheffe’s Polynomial Optimisation of Laterite Concrete Incorporating Periwinkle Shells and Coir,Article,Ogbo O.S.; Momoh E.O.; Ndububa E.E.; Afolayan O.O.; Onuche S.; Agada J.O.,KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering,27.0,2023,4001,4019,10.1007/s12205-023-0110-4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85166219320&doi=10.1007%2fs12205-023-0110-4&partnerID=40&md5=a2429d2f7d3c2dab49839a94a1217442,12267988,Scopus,Coir; Concrete; Laterite; Optimisation; Periwinkle shell; Scheffe’s polynomial,"Recent emphases on minimising the carbon footprint of concrete have focused on the use of non-conventional materials for the production of low-cost concrete. Such materials include laterite, periwinkle shells and coir which have been reported as suitable for use as fine and coarse aggregate replacements in specified proportions. However, the use of two or more unconventional materials in a concrete mix would require significant experimental effort that is time- and resource-consuming and usually performed by trial and error to determine the optimum mix design. A popular optimisation technique used for concrete mix design is Scheffe’s second-degree polynomial modelling. However, the application of a more accurate Scheffe’s third-degree polynomial optimisation technique in designing cementitious composites incorporating unconventional aggregates is rare. This study, therefore, presents the use of Scheffe’s third-degree model to determine the optimum proportions of coir, laterite and periwinkle shell aggregates in a concrete mix in order to obtain the best mechanical properties of the hardened concrete. The constituents of the concrete were optimised for seven components of water, cement, fine-aggregate, laterite soil, coarse aggregate, periwinkle shell and coir on an N(7, 3) Sheffe’s factor space. The optimal mix ratio for compressive and flexural strengths of 11.33 and 1.20 MPa, respectively, was 0.5149, 1.044, 3.009, 0.126, 3.934, 0.054, and 0.0046 for pseudo-components Xi: {∀i = 1, 2 3, 4, 4, 6, 7}. The coefficients of determination (R 2) were 98.74% and 98.53% for the compressive and flexural response models, respectively, while the p-values obtained for the response coefficient fit parameters βi, βij, βijk for (i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) were 96.77% and 91.49% for the compressive and flexural strength models, respectively. The optimised Low-Performance Concrete (LPC) is about 4% cheaper than LPC made from conventional aggregates and is adequate for patio slabs, pedestrian footpaths, kerbs, and floorings in residential buildings. The use of Sheffe’s third-degree model eliminates the significant experimental efforts needed in the design of concrete mixes incorporating unconventional aggregates. © 2023, Korean Society of Civil Engineers."

Given that around 75% of global resources are consumed in urban areas, understanding the true association between urbanization (UR) and ecological quality is necessary for better urban strategies. Alongside this, eco-innovation (ECO) can limit environmental pollution and thus, it is the cornerstone of environmental policies. On that note, this research discloses the nexus between eco-innovation, economic growth (EGR), and ecological quality by considering the non-linear effects of UR in the emerging seven (E-7) nations from 1992 to 2018. Unlike previous literature, the newly developed indicator of ecological quality (the load capacity factor (LCF)) is adopted to understand the connection between UR, eco-innovation, and ecological quality since this new comprehensive indicator is based on both biocapacity and ecological footprint (EF). In the methodology, the “Continuously Updated-Fully Modified” (CuP-FM) test is used since this method offers diverse benefits for panel data estimation by accounting for major panel data estimation issues including autocorrelation, endogeneity, heteroscedasticity, fractional integration, and cross-sectional dependence. The empirical estimates unveiled that the current levels as well as high levels of UR limit the LCF. This evidence suggests that UR in the E-7 nations expands ecological degradation. This finding contradicts the assertions of ecological modernization theory that expanding urbanization brings some ecological benefits. Similarly, economic growth alleviates ecological quality. However, eco-innovation and agricultural land (AGL) contribute to enhancing the LCF and promoting ecological quality. Further, UR and eco-innovation Granger cause the LCF. Lastly, comprehensive urban environmental strategies are discussed to promote sustainable urbanization backed by eco-innovation. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Hence, this inquiry examined the implications of public borrowing and access to electricity on environmental sustainability (proxied by ecological footprint (ECOL) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions) in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), largely overlooked in the literature. In addition to pre-estimation, diagnostic, and robustness checks utilized in the study, the instrumental variable generalized method of moment (IV-GMM) approach is employed to examine annual data from 39 SSA economies between 2005 and 2018. The key findings indicate that public debt negatively influences environmental sustainability in the region at a certain level of threshold, while access to electricity has the potential to trigger environmental sustainability but remain below the expected threshold to mitigate environmental damage in SSA. The study provides recommendations for SSA policymakers to significantly reduce pollution and protect the environment which is vital for sustainable development. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

The study covers variables related to economics, human geography, energy, and institutions, showing significant variations among them. The NCA model identifies economic complexity and fossil energy consumption as necessary conditions for high-carbon emission intensity. On the other hand, the fsQCA model reveals sufficient conditions for both high- and low-carbon emission intensity, presenting different causal combinations of variables. For high-carbon emission intensity, nine causal solutions are identified, emphasizing the roles of economic growth, urbanization, fossil energy consumption, and institutional quality. Reducing carbon emission intensity requires addressing economic complexity and reducing reliance on fossil energy consumption. Policymakers should focus on sustainable economic development, environmentally friendly urbanization, and transitioning to renewable energy sources. This research’s originality lies in its qualitative approach, going beyond traditional regression methods to explore necessary and sufficient conditions for carbon emission intensity. It offers valuable insights into the complex interplay of variables, providing multiple causal configurations for both high- and low-carbon emission intensity. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Previous attempts in the literature to optimise clean-in-place processes have focused on trialling cleaning over a range of parameter (e.g. temperature and chemical concentration) combinations or modelling the process using equations. However, these methods do not aim to minimise the number of experimental trials that a manufacturer must conduct and only determine the optimal cleaning parameters for the average fouling condition. In this work, Bayesian optimisation is used to minimise the number of cleaning parameter combinations that require trialling thereby reducing the disruption to a manufacturing process during the optimisation procedure. Secondly, ultrasonic sensors are used to monitor the cleaning process and enable real-time optimisation of the parameters to adapt to variations in the fouling condition. Multi-objective optimisation was used in both tasks to simultaneously minimise the economic cost, carbon footprint, and water usage of a clean-in-place process. Bayesian optimisation was able to optimise the process after trialling only nine cleaning parameter combinations (achieving between 98.7% and 100% optimisation of the objective function compared with the global optimum). Bayesian optimisation displayed a small advantage (0.0–4.7% decrease in the objective function) compared with methods used in previous literature. Real-time optimisation of the cleaning parameters using ultrasonic sensor data improved the optimisation objective function by 0.0 – 4.8% for all fouling instances tested when utilising results from ten trials conducted during the Bayesian optimisation procedure along with five additional cleaning processes under normal operation. © 2023"

Achieving a net zero emissions scenario will require a 4–5 fold decrease of carbon emissions in the coming years. The carbon footprint of radiation therapy has not been specifically studied to date. In this review we summarize the content of the carbon footprint dedicated session at the annual meeting of the French society of radiation oncology (SFRO). We discuss the French healthcare system carbon footprint and its major drivers and our work on the estimation of the carbon footprint of external beam radiation therapy in the French setting. We developed a dedicated methodology to estimate the carbon footprint related to radiation therapies, and describe the main drivers of emissions based on a single centre as an example, namely patient's rides, accelerators acquisition and maintenance and data storage. Based on the carbon footprint calculated in our centres, we propose mitigation strategies and an estimation of their respective potential. Our results may be extrapolated to other occidental settings by adapting emission factors (kilograms of carbon per item or euro) to other national settings. External beam radiation therapy has a major carbon footprint that may be mitigated in many ways that may impact how radiation therapy treatments are delivered, as well as the national organization of the radiotherapy sector. This needs to be taken into account when thinking about the future of radiotherapy. © 2023 Société française de radiothérapie oncologique (SFRO)"

This leads to the generation of a massive amount of e-commerce packaging waste as well as resource utilisation and CO2 emissions that go into the production of packaging. The aim of this study is to analyse the impact of COVID-19 on consumer trends in the e-commerce industry, quantitatively analyse the carbon emissions of packaging used, and present a circular model to reduce the demand for virgin packaging. Using a convenience sampling method, an online questionnaire was administered to 285 respondents to gather data on changes in shopping practices due to the COVID-19 pandemic, consumer awareness levels and observations on packaging materials, and practices employed by e-commerce companies. It was found that the number of orders placed per month increased after the onset of the pandemic and that most households dispose of packaging with household wastes as opposed to reusing or recycling. Primary data (study participants packaging waste production) in combination with secondary data (emission factors) was further used to calculate emissions due to mixed packaging waste, which came out to be 2,705.94 kg CO2e per metric tonne of waste produced. In addition, the paper presents a practical solution to reducing virgin packaging material production, as well as modifications in packaging used to ensure efficient working of the packaging reuse model when implemented by the e-commerce companies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Additionally, institutional quality is crucial in ensuring environmental sustainability and moderating the link between economic complexity and ecological footprint. The task of achieving sustainable environmental development and preventing further degradation of the environment poses a formidable challenge to policymakers. This study delves into the significance of technology innovation and renewable energy in creating a more sustainable environment. Recognizing the need for a more critical review, this research establishes the dynamic linkage between ecological footprint, renewable energy consumption, and technological innovation, especially in conjunction with a moderating component, particularly institutional quality, in G20 countries from 1990 to 2021. We employ advanced panel approaches to address panel data analysis concerns, such as cross-sectional dependence, slope heterogeneity, unit root, cointegration test and CS-ARDL. The long-term estimator indicates that renewable energy and technological innovation negatively but significantly impact the ecological footprint. Whilst economic growth, FDI, and urbanization have shown a positive and significant impact on ecological footprint; institutional quality negatively moderates the relationship between ecological footprint, renewable energy, and technological innovation in the G20 countries. Further evidence from the Dumitrescu-Hurlin Granger causality test shows that efforts to expand access to renewable energy, technological advancements, and economic growth will significantly affect environmental impacts. Based on our results, it is imperative to introduce more favorable legislation and encourage technological advancements in the field of renewable energy if we want to achieve our sustainable development objectives. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

The paper uses the second-generation panel data estimation techniques through the novel augmented Anderson–Hsiao (AAH) estimator. This method allows regressors to be self-instrumenting and efficient with panel data where the cross-sectional units are greater than time and remains valid even when errors are correlated. The result of the Westerlund cointegration confirms the existence of a long-run relationship. Also, the AAH estimation finds that a 1% increase in income inequality is associated with a 0.567 decline in environmental degradation. Furthermore, a rise in GDP per capita is linked to a reduction in environmental pollution. However, it does not validate the existence of the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis. Population growth and urbanization were found to exacerbate environmental degradation while access to electricity enhances a sustainable environment. To ensure the robustness of the AAH estimation, the Pseudo-Poison Maximum Likelihood Estimator with the high dimensional fixed effects was used. The results showed that, although the effects were smaller, all the coefficients survived. Therefore, our findings substantiate the marginal propensity to emit hypothesis which posits that in economies with high inequality, there is the likelihood that a large proportion of the population would reduce their energy and other carbon-intensive consumption, which consequently improves environmental quality. Although this channel of reducing emissions is not sustainable as it comes with huge economic losses.

Physiochemical analysis followed by XRD, FTIR, TGA-DSC, and FE-SEM was performed. The findings demonstrate that calcium-rich eminently hydraulic mortars were used with a binder/aggregate (B/Ag) ratio of about 1:2.8±0.42. Mineralogy identified load-bearing phases: aragonite, vaterite, and calcite with 45±5% clay minerals. Absorption and stretching bands detected by FTIR at 1631 cm−1 and 2954 cm−1 corroborate the inclusion of plant organics. All samples showed aragonite around 870 cm−1, which can be traced back to bonded CO2 and the subsequent carbonation throughout the age of the structure. TGA-DSC validated XRD and FE-SEM analysis exhibited 18.66±3.40% weight loss at >600 °C, indicating calcite decomposition and CO2 release with CO2/H2O ratio of 3.31 to 3.66.

First, the inter-regional input–output model is used to calculate the carbon footprint of each province. Then, the panel quantile regression model is used to investigate the impact of solar energy generation on different quantiles of carbon footprint. The results show that from 2012 to 2020, China's carbon footprint is at a high level, which is not conducive to the achievement of the goal of peaking carbon dioxide emissions. The eastern region has the highest carbon footprint, followed by the western region, the central region has the lowest carbon footprint, and its carbon footprint proportion continues to decline. The increase of solar energy generation can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of high quantile location, but has no significant impact on the carbon footprint of the middle and low quantile locations. Except for the negative impact of afforestation area on carbon footprint, the others control variables are all positive. Therefore, to reduce the carbon footprint of China, it is necessary to upgrade solar technology, increase solar energy generation, reduce energy consumption per unit of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) and the share of coal consumption, strengthen forestry management and reduce reliance on private vehicles. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

The achievements of the developed dryer focus on controlling the temperature of the dryer, increasing the drying rate, reducing energy consumption, and providing high-quality products. The HSSD was tested and evaluated for drying basil and sage herbs at 30, 40, and 50°C. The results showed that the fresh basil and sage leaves of 1 kg with a moisture content of 84.7% and 75.53% (wet basis) were dried within 58, 46, 32 and 38, 28, and 20 h at 30, 40, and 50°C, respectively. Correspondingly, the traditional drying methods achieved 96 h outdoors and 144 h indoors at room temperature. The average of the fabricated flat-plate solar collector efficiency (thermal efficiency, ηfpsc) was ranged from 49.18% ± 9.52% to 66.02% ± 2.8%. The highest drying rates were achieved with the HSSD method. Moreover, the HSSD method led to a remarkable saving in energy with values ranging from 25.54% to 77.1% versus the traditional drying methods. While the best quality in terms of essential oil content and microbial load for the dried basil and sage herbs was achieved by the HSSD at 40°C. Finally, the HSSD is a promising energy-efficient method where it can save 70% of energy consumption, thus reducing the carbon footprint of drying processes, and providing higher quality products compared to the conventional methods. © 2023 Institute of Food Technologists."

This study proposes a method to improve the early strength of ternary mixture mortar using aluminum sulfate, evaluates its effectiveness, and tests the optimal dosage. The fresh paste hydration heat and mortar macroscopic properties, such as mechanical performance, resistivity, and ultrasonic pulse velocity, were measured at different dosages (0, 1, 2, and 3%) of aluminum sulfate. Microscopic testing methods, such as X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and scanning electron microscopy, were employed to analyze the interaction mechanism between aluminum sulfate and the ternary mixture. The research findings demonstrated that aluminum sulfate enhanced the early mechanical properties and significantly improved the 28-day resistivity. Dosages of 1% and 2% had no adverse effects on the 28 d strength, whereas a 3% dosage reduced the 28 d strength. In the presence of aluminum sulfate, the early hydration heat release of the mixture increased significantly, ettringite became the main early hydration product, and portlandite decreased significantly. Considering the changes in the early strength, 28 d strength, and surface electrical resistivity, a 1% aluminum sulfate dosage was determined as the optimal addition level. © 2023 The Author(s)"

One of the few modifiable costs in the OR is single-use, sterile surgical supplies (SUSSS). If SUSSS are opened on the scrub table and not used, then they are wasted. High-fidelity SUSSS usage data is important to strategically implement solutions to reduce waste of SUSSS in the OR. OR waste reduction may decrease health systems' carbon footprints and reduce spending. Methods: A convenience sample of general pediatric surgical cases was observed in summer 2021. HIPAA-free images of the surgical scrub table were acquired every 2 s with minimal impact on pediatric OR workflow. These images were asynchronously analyzed to obtain SUSSS usage data for each case. Results: Image data from three pediatric surgeons performing 41 pediatric surgeries was reviewed. The median cost of unused SUSSS was $13.10 (IQR = $2.73–$47.97) with a range of $0.07 to $489.08 wasted in a single surgery. The mean number of items wasted was 9.3 ± 6.4. The most frequently wasted items were sutures, syringes, towels, paper rulers, and specimen cups. The most expensive sources of waste were laparoscopic trocars, sutures, insufflation needles, drapes, and guidewires. Conclusions: SUSSS that were discarded without being used were successfully identified through the asynchronous analysis of HIPAA-free OR scrub table image data. This may be an opportunity to identify SUSSS waste efficiently without an observer in the OR. © 2023"

For example, melt spinning polyester fibre production, spinning, weaving, fabric dyeing and finishing are high-energy consumption processes. Down processing, fabric dyeing and finishing are typical water consumption and wastewater pollutant discharge processes. Carbon and water footprints are practical tools for evaluating the environmental impact of a product in its life cycle. This article quantified and evaluated the carbon and water footprints of the life cycle of 100 down jackets – from raw material production to recycling and disposal without transportation activities. The results showed that the carbon footprint of the 100 down jackets production was 2544.1 kgCO2e with recycling. As for the water footprint, it showed that fabric production had a great impact on water eutrophication and water scarcity. The water scarcity footprint of 100 down jackets production was 27.46 m3H2Ot, respectively. The water eutrophication footprint generated by producing 100 down jackets in new industry was 1.91 kgPO43−eq. The comprehensive assessment of carbon footprint and water footprint with the life cycle assessment polygon method indicated that the raw material production phase of down jackets generated a more significant impact on the environment than the use phase. The impact on the environment during the use phase is primarily the environmental load on water resources. © The Author(s) 2023."

This study focuses on Phyllostachys edulis (commonly known as Moso) cultivation managed in a temperate region (Italy) with the aim to assess the Carbon Footprint offset by comparing carbon storage capability with GHG emissions of its cultivation. On one side, a dynamic model based on the allometric equations of International Bamboo and Rattan Organization (INBAR) and the parameters of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is developed and validated, using primary data to estimate the direct carbon dioxide (CO2) uptake in biomass. On the other side, GHG emissions produced by the management of the plantation are quantified through the Life Cycle Assessment (i.e., Carbon Footprint) over a period of 100 years. The Carbon Footprint offset is −26,628 t CO2eq (ha)−1 over the specified time frame. It is “net negative” considering an overall Carbon Footprint of 259 t CO2eq (ha)−1 and a cumulative uptake of −26,888 t CO2 (ha)−1. In particular, the CO2 annually removed is 275 t (ha)−1 from the eighth year onwards; this is embedded as carbon in the harvested above-ground biomass and regenerated in the same year (1/3 of culms annually collected). The potential CO2 sequestration per land unit (1 ha) is about 36 times that of a mixed Italian forest. The carbon model is tested to shed light on the dependance on initial conditions (i.e., the life span and the efficient use of the harvested biomass), showing a reduction of the Carbon Footprint offset (from −10 % to −77 %).This study supports the idea of bamboo plantations as a valuable solution for climate change mitigation as long as they are properly managed and the harvested biomass is transformed in durable goods (e.g., construction materials, furniture, fiber, and art), thus generating a semi-permanent carbon storage. © 2023"

Reducing meat consumption, especially ruminant meat, has been proven to significantly reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, reduce agricultural land use, and improve human health. Whereas the shift to a plant-based diet from meat is by far the most commonly investigated dietary change pattern, nutrient-rich forage fish with a low carbon footprint is receiving increasing interest from a global food system perspective. In this study, we attempted to fill the current research gap to better understand the environmental and nutritional impacts of forage fish as a substitute for ruminant meat by 2050. We developed environmental- and nutrient-based consumption scenarios for meat substitution. Global ruminant meat demand and potential forage fish supply were projected using a global economic model and catches over the last few decades. We found that the potential forage fish supply could replace 10 % of global ruminant meat consumption, resulting in global ruminant-related reductions in total GHG emissions and land use by up to 15 % and 10 %, respectively, by 2050. Such a dietary change could also increase the intake of essential nutrients, such as omega-3 fatty acids (DHA and EPA), vitamin B12, and calcium, especially in deficient regions. Our analyses highlight the potential of forage fish as part of a portfolio of sustainable dietary solutions, while effective fisheries management and sociocultural acceptance of forage fish consumption are necessary to realize the potential of forage fish. © 2023 The Authors"

This surge in interest in regulatory interventions relates to questions of whether regulatory deterrence is effective or are better alternatives to state regulations. This study investigates relationships between environmental sustainability and regulatory quality for a cross-section of Eastern European economies between 1998Q4 and 2017Q4 using advanced feasible generalized least square (FGLS) panel cointegration, Common Correlated Effects Mean Group (CCEMG), and Dumitrescu Hurlin panel causality estimation approaches. The outcomes indicate there are cointegrating relationships between regulatory quality and environmental sustainability. Instructively, we find that countries with strong regulations have improved environmental quality controlling unsustainable growth and fossil energy consumption. The Dumitrescu Hurlin panel causality check indicates bidirectional causality between ecological footprint and carbon dioxide emissions in the region. Additionally, there is unidirectional causality running (i) from CO2 emissions to regulatory quality and (ii) from gross per capital income to both regulatory quality and carbon dioxide emissions. For policymakers, it is important to reinforce stringent regulations as the economies begin to grow and consume more energy, which is considered a major cause of climate change and global warming. Similar strict environmental regulations are needed to ensure corporations are made accountable for their actions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

However, the economic and technological factors that have affected these MFIs have not been identified previously. Moreover, it is unclear whether the improvements in the MFIs have contributed to Japan’s progress toward carbon mitigation. In this study, we quantified the contribution of the factors in the capital-embodied supply chain to changes in the MFIs at the national and sector levels. We also examined the consistency of MFI improvements with carbon footprint reduction. Our results show that, in many sectors, structural changes in the supply chain improved two of the MFIs (resource productivity and material circularity) but increased the carbon footprint of the sector. To address this conflict, producers need to manage their supply chains based on an understanding of the nexus between material consumption and carbon emissions, paying particular attention to supply chains associated with capital formation. © 2023 The Authors.

Our novel review strategy allows us to report thematic analysis, co-citation analysis, research collaboration analysis, and methodological and topical contribution. As policymakers prioritize sustainable development, we allow them to understand different dynamics of academic institutions’ carbon footprint and report policy suggestions to improve it.

Impact: Travel, procurement and supply, material use, waste management, energy use and water consumption within dentistry have a considerable effect on the environment. There are, however, marked knowledge gaps pertaining to the impact of orthodontic treatment. Challenges: The lack of awareness of the NHS contribution to the carbon footprint and net-zero goals among healthcare workers, the NHS backlogs and budget cuts, and cross-infection control requirements particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic are some of the many challenges to making healthcare delivery more sustainable. Opportunities: By considering the triple bottom line (social, environmental and economic), incorporating the four Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Rethink), taking practical action, including steps to educate ourselves and the wider team, and to promote research on environmental sustainability, we can get one step closer to reaching the NHS net-zero goals. Conclusion: Climate change is a global health threat with multiple contributors associated with orthodontic treatment delivery, which can be tackled on an individual, organisational and system level. © The Author(s) 2023."

Here, we engineered biomass-derived nanostructured carbon nanofibers integrated with highly dispersed bimetallic Ti/CoOx nanoparticles through the thermal transition of metal-phenolic functionalized industrial leather wastes for synergistic SO2 adsorption and in situ catalytic conversion. The generation of surface-SO32- and peroxide species (O22-) by Ti/CoOx achieved catalytic conversion of adsorbed SO2 into value-added liquid H2SO4, which can be discharged from porous nanofibers. This approach can also avoid the accumulation of the adsorbed SO2, thereby achieving high desulfurization activity and a long operating life over 6000 min, preceding current state-of-the-art active carbon-based desulfurization materials. Combined with the techno-economic and carbon footprint analysis from 36 areas in China, we demonstrated an economically viable and scalable solution for real-world SO2 removal on the industrial scale. © 2023 American Chemical Society."

With the fixed effects model estimator, we find that income facilitates economic complexity to mitigate ecological footprint, CO2 emissions, N2O emissions and greenhouse gas emissions. Also, we fit a partial linear functional-coefficient model to find that income influences economic complexity to exert a nonlinear effect on ecological footprint, CO2 emissions, N2O emissions and greenhouse gas emissions. We find that economic complexity leads to an increase in ecological footprint, CO2 emissions, N2O emissions and greenhouse gas emissions at lower income levels but gradually dampens them as income rises. Finally, by applying the Method of Moments Quantile regression to control for distributional heterogeneity, we also find that the mitigating effect of economic complexity on ecological footprint, CO2 emissions, N2O emissions and greenhouse gas emissions is transmitted through income across quantiles.

Companies such as Daimler, Apple, and Amazon have publicly declared their goal of becoming carbon neutral or “net zero” in a near future. They are responding to a growing demand for sustainable products and services. Companies have a variety of options for carbon emission reductions available to them, including internal reductions such as adopting renewable energy as well as buying carbon offsets. This raises the question of whether consumers perceive the different types of carbon emission reductions as equivalent, or whether they favor the implementation of internal measures. We investigate this issue empirically through surveys and incentive-compatible discrete choice experiments. We find clear consumer preferences and willingness to pay for companies to reduce their carbon footprint when companies internally reduce their controllable emissions rather than buying carbon offsets for these emissions, and it is especially true for eco-conscious consumers. Consumers place roughly the same value, however, on internal reductions in controllable emissions and buying offsets for the same amount of uncontrollable emissions. © 2023 The Authors.

Despite broad interest in energy consumption and CO2 emissions generated by soybean production, there are few impact-oriented water footprint assessments of soybean production. This study evaluates the fossil energy, carbon, and water footprints of China’s soybean production so that key environmental impacts can be identified. To provide reliable results for decision-making, uncertainty analysis is conducted based on the Monte Carlo model. Results show that the impact on climate change, ecosystem quality, human health, and resources is 3.33 × 103 kg CO2 eq (GSD2 = 1.87), 6.18 × 10−5 Species·yr (GSD2 = 1.81), 3.26 × 10−3 Disability-adjusted Life Years (GSD2 = 1.81), and 81.51 $ (GSD2 = 2.28), respectively. Freshwater ecotoxicity is the dominant contributor (77.69%) to the ecosystem quality category, while climate change (85.22%) is the dominant contributor to the human health category. Key factors analysis results show that diammonium phosphate and diesel, and on-site emissions, are the major contributors to the overall environmental burden of soybean production. Several policy recommendations are proposed, focusing on trade structure optimization, efficient resource use, and technological improvements. Such policy recommendations provide valuable insights to those decision-makers so that they can prepare appropriate mitigation policies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."

Meanwhile, training DNNs consumes huge energy, leading to excessive carbon emissions and accelerating global warming. To solve these problems, we first propose a novel filter pruning algorithm for neural network named Discrete Rank Pruning (DRP). It is convenient to deploy large scale models on resource-limited devices. Second, we propose a novel calculation method named Neural Network Carbon Emission Calculator (NNCEC) to quantify DNNs energy consumption and carbon emission. It makes the environmental cost of neural network become transparent. Moreover, many pruning methods apply sparse regularization on the filter weights of the convolution layers to reduce the degradation of performance after pruning. We analyze these methods and find that it is necessary to consider the influence of the bias term. Based on these, we propose a novel sparse method named Consideration Bias Sparsity (CBS). Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets with LeNet-5, VGGNet-16, ResNet-56, GoogLeNet and DenseNet-40 demonstrate the effectiveness of CBS and DRP. For LeNet-5, CBS achieves 1.87% increase in accuracy than sparse regularization method on MNIST.

1094,Does financial development has (a)symmetric effect on environmental quality: insights from South Africa,Article,Dada J.T.; Ojeyinka T.A.; Al-Faryan M.A.S.,Journal of Economic Studies,50.0,2023,1130,1157,10.1108/JES-06-2022-0352,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139212229&doi=10.1108%2fJES-06-2022-0352&partnerID=40&md5=858c63037f12eba7881f51f1db625178,01443585,Scopus,Carbon footprint; Ecological footprint; Environmental quality; Financial development; Non-carbon footprint; South Africa,"Purpose: This paper investigates the (a)symmetric effects of financial development in the presence of economic growth, energy consumption, urbanization and foreign direct investment on environmental quality of South Africa between 1980 and 2017. Design/methodology/approach: A robust measure of financial development is generated using banking institutions and non-banking institutions market-based financial development indicators, while environmental quality is measured using carbon footprint, non-carbon footprint and ecological footprint. The objectives of the study are captured using linear and non-linear autoregressive distributed lag. Findings: The result from the symmetric analysis suggests that financial development stimulates carbon footprint and ecological footprint in the short run; however, financial development abates non-carbon footprint. In the long run, financial development has a significant negative effect on carbon footprint and ecological footprint. However, the asymmetric analysis established strong asymmetric effect in the short run, while no asymmetric effect is found in the long run. The short run asymmetric analysis reveals that positive shock in financial development increases carbon footprint and ecological footprint; however, positive changes in financial development reduce non-carbon footprint. Negative shocks in financial development, on the other hand, have a positive impact carbon footprint, non-carbon footprint and ecological footprint. Practical implications: The study's outcome implies that the concept of “more finance, more growth” could also be applied to “more finance, better environment” in South Africa. The study offers vital policy suggestions for the realization of sustainable development in South Africa. Originality/value: This empiric adds to the body of knowledge on the influence of financial development on various components of environmental quality (carbon footprint, non-carbon footprint and ecological footprint) in South Africa. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."

We also explore the interaction of culture and climate-linked incentive compensation with climate change impact. Research findings/insights: Using firm-level climate change strategy and carbon emissions to measure climate change impacts, we find that climate-linked compensation is associated with improved climate change strategy. Climate-related incentives for the CEO and other (operational) executives are found to be negatively associated with firm-level carbon emissions, although the relationship is not as strong; however, no such association is found for climate-linked compensation of the board and top-3 executives. Country-level attitudes to whether solutions for environmental issues are considered a joint (society) responsibility versus an individual's personal responsibility are found to have an effect on the association between climate-linked compensation and climate change impacts. We also find that country-level cultural views enhance the positive association between climate-linked compensation and climate change strategy but not the association with actual firm-level carbon emissions. Further analysis shows that non-US firms drive our study's findings. Finally, improvement in climate strategy is found to have a positive effect on Tobin's Q but has no effect on profitability. Theoretical/academic implications: Academic research is growing on the role of climate change risk and carbon emissions in corporate decisions. The findings of our study are important given that linking executives' compensation with climate performance is gaining momentum. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine any link between climate-linked compensation and climate change impact. Practitioner/policy implications: While climate-linked compensation is associated with positive changes in climate strategy, its association with firm-level carbon emissions is promising. This is particularly the case when this compensation is offered to executives who are likely to make operational decisions with a direct impact on a firm's carbon footprint and carbon emissions. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

As part of the energy system, integrated energy stations play an important role in the low-carbon transition of the energy sector. However, most of the existing studies on carbon emissions from integrated energy stations focus on the operation phase or a single module within it and lack analysis and prediction of carbon emissions from all phases of the integrated energy station. In this paper, based on the perspective of life cycle assessment, system dynamics is used to establish a life cycle carbon emission model for integrated energy stations from four phases: production & materialization, construction, operation & maintenance, and disposal & recycling. This paper takes wind power integrated energy stations as an example, simulates the characteristics of the life cycle carbon emissions of integrated energy stations, and identifies the key factors affecting the carbon emissions. The simulation results show that the carbon emissions of the integrated energy station are mainly concentrated in the production and operation of the energy station, and the increase in the service life of the energy station will not have a significant impact on the total carbon emissions. This paper provides the theoretical guidance and decision-making basis for the formulation of low-carbon emission reduction measures for integrated energy stations. © 2023 The Author(s)"

Both policies could be considered successful in environmental terms if they reduce the energy or induce a substitution from fossil fuels to electricity. The analysis is carried out with two methods, matching with differences-in-differences (assuming exogenous treatment) and instrumental variables (assuming endogenous treatment), using a panel database built from the Longitudinal Survey of Firms. The results show that the carbon footprint policy does not affect the intensity of fuel expenditure or electricity expenditure. On the other hand, the energy efficiency policy increases the intensity of electricity expenditure. Thus, it is concluded that both policies are not effective in reducing the energy intensity at the firm level. The above could be attributed to a weak implementation, monitoring, and/or commitment of these voluntary environmental policies in many Chilean firms. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."

To foster biofuel production, the Brazilian government implemented a national biofuel policy, known as RenovaBio, in which greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction credits are provided to biofuel producers based on the carbon intensities (CI) of the fuels they produce. In this study, we configured the GREET model to evaluate life cycle GHG emissions of Brazilian sugar cane ethanol, using data from 67 individual sugar cane mills submitted to RenovaBio in 2019/2020. The average CI per megajoule of sugar cane ethanol produced in Brazil for use in the U.S. was estimated to be 35.2 g of CO2 equivalent, a 62% reduction from U.S. petroleum gasoline blendstock without considering the impacts of land use change. The three major GHG sources were on-field N2O emissions (24.3%), sugar cane farming energy use (24.2%), and sugar cane ethanol transport (19.3%). With the probability density functions for key input parameters derived from individual mill data, we performed stochastic simulations with the GREET model to estimate the variations in sugar cane ethanol CI and confirmed that despite the larger variations in sugar cane ethanol CI, the fuel provided a robust GHG reduction benefit compared to gasoline blendstock. © 2023 UChicago Argonne, LLC, Operator of Argonne National Laboratory.

Rice is one of the world's top three staple food crops. In the present study, the energy footprint (EF), carbon footprint (CF), energy production efficiency (EPE), carbon production efficiency (CPE), and economic benefit (EB) of dry direct-seeded rice (DSR), wet direct-seeded rice (WSR), and transplanted rice (TPR), respectively, were integrated and assessed. Results: The yield of WSR and TPR was 9.64% and 13.76% higher than that of DSR, respectively. However, DSR has less irrigation and less intensive field tillage; therefore, its energy input, and CF, were 37.47% and 44.29%, and 29.35% and 34.77%, lower than those of WSR and TPR, respectively; the EPE and CPE were obviously improved; and the EB was not lower than that of WSR and TPR. Current rice production relies heavily on non-renewable energy inputs such as nitrogen fertilizer, diesel, and machinery. Therefore, the key to improving EPE, CPE, and EB in rice production at the same time as reducing CF was to improve water use efficiency and decrease the intensity of paddy tillage. Conclusion: The DSR has higher social, economic, and ecological benefits and can be the preferred rice planting method for rice production areas. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry."

Unfortunately, there are few lifecycle assessments (LCAs) of commercial lithium-ion batteries available in the literature, and those that are available focus on the cradle-to-gate stage, often with little or no consideration of the use phase. To address this shortfall, we report both cradle-to-gate and use-phase GHG emissions for the 2020 Model Year Ford Explorer plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) NMC622 battery. Using primary industry data for battery design and manufacturing, cradle-to-gate emissions are estimated to be 1.38 t CO2e (101 kg CO2e/kWh), with 78% from materials and parts production and 22% from cell, module, and pack manufacturing. Using mass-induced energy consumptions of 0.6 and 1.6 kWh/(100 km 100 kg) for charge-depleting and -sustaining modes, respectively, the mass-induced use-phase emission of the battery is estimated to be 1.04 t CO2e. We show that battery emissions during the cradle-to-gate and use phases are comparable and that both phases need to be considered. A holistic and harmonized LCA approach that includes battery use is required to reduce carbon footprint uncertainties and guide future battery designs. © 2023 American Chemical Society"

In this paper, we trace MNEs’ carbon footprints (CFs) to the upstream along global value chains (GVCs) and analyze the driving factors that lead to changes in MNEs’ CFs through hierarchical structural decomposition analysis. Our findings show that the distribution of MNEs’ CFs is highly consistent with the distribution of their GVC production networks, where these CFs are mainly concentrated in advanced economies, and emerging markets and developing economies only account for a small but gradually increasing share. Further, MNEs’ CFs are mainly attributed to medium high/high-tech manufacturing, especially in emerging markets and developing economies, where over one-half of these firms’ CFs are generated in computer, electronics and optical products and motor vehicle production. Finally, we analyze the different impacts of changes in the emissions of domestic-owned enterprises, foreign-invested enterprises in host countries and emissions generated abroad on MNEs’ CFs as well as the main driving factors leading to these changes in the US, Germany, China, India, Mexico and Singapore. Our findings provide support for MNEs’ whole global-value-chain emission control to realize global carbon neutrality and shed light on possible pathways for mitigating the domestic carbon emissions of economies that are deeply integrated into GVCs. © 2023"

However, the autonomy of electric vehicles (EVs) remains significantly lower than their ICE counterpart: it depends on the amount of energy stored and its rate of utilization, characterized by the instantaneous power consumption (IPC). Although IPC can be measured from on-board voltage and current sensors, in route planning applications it is of paramount importance to generate prior estimates from other sources of information, such as the mass of the vehicle, its velocity, acceleration, aerodynamic, and rolling resistances (among other vehicle and terrain parameters). In this work, we propose the estimation of average IPC for a given path, using only localization information provided by a global navigation satellite system antenna, at different levels of errors. Our work is experimentally validated with an EV on the road, achieving on average a 99.7% of power estimation accuracy for a localization error of ± 1.5 m -as best case- and 73.6% accuracy for ±8.6 m of localization error - as worst case. These results encourages us to use only position data to estimate average IPC of EVs, avoiding the need of placing extra sensors into the vehicles.  © 1982-2012 IEEE."

Furthermore, in addition to the waste-to-energy approach, RDF production reduces the amount of waste disposed in landfills, thus reducing greenhouse gasses emissions and water streams' contamination. Nevertheless, there are still numerous technological constraints to RDF use, namely, its moisture content and granulometry that are highly dependent on the production process. In this context, this work discusses the contribution of RDF to the promotion of the circular economy, presenting the main RDF properties and production processes. An analysis of the RDF market in Europe, Asia, North America, and Africa was performed by analyzing imports and exports. The analysis highlights the expansion of RDF as an energy source in current times with Europe as a driving force for its integration following circular economy guidelines. However, incentives would significantly speed up RDF adoption and decrease the carbon footprint as a short-term mitigation strategy. © 2023 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

The higher operating voltage is necessary to deliver electrical machines with an acceptable power density, which will increase the risk of partial discharge (PD), especially in the low-pressure environment at high altitude. This article reviews the opportunity to use high dielectric strength gases to improve the PD performance of electrical machines for aerospace applications. PD characteristics of machine winding wires are tested in air, CO2, SF6, CF3I, C3H2F4, and C3F7CN. Mixture ratios of 60% C3H2F4 / 40% CO2 and 30% C3F7CN / 70% CO2 can remain gaseous under atmospheric pressure at a temperature of -30 °C, with the PD inception voltage (PDIV) of machine winding wires approximately three times higher in these mixtures than air at 0.2-bar absolute. The test results have been applied to demonstrate that a machine using a high dielectric strength gas as part of its insulation system could tolerate a higher dc bus voltage while still being considered as Type-I (PD-free). In addition, endurance tests using insulating gases demonstrate the prospect of an improved time to failure for Type-II insulation systems.  © 2022 IEEE."

Methods: The analysis scope covers raw material receiving, a liquefaction process, utility, and storage and loading of the product. The assessed impacts are categorized as primary, secondary, and energy usage impacts using a life cycle assessment method that refers to ISO 14040-2016 and ISO 14044-2017 guidelines. The three methods for impact evaluation included ReCiPe 2016 Midpoint (H) v.1.03, CML-IA Baseline v.3.05, and cumulative energy demand (CED) methods. Results: Every ton of LNG product produced global warming, ozone depletion, acidification, and eutrophication potential of 699.31 kg CO2-eq, 2.62 × 10−4 kg CFC11-eq, 0.4281 kg SO2-eq, and 0.1155 kg PO4-eq, respectively. The secondary impact of the photochemical oxidant was 0.81968 kg C2H4-eq/ton. Abiotic depletion potential–fossil was observed at 23.41183 MJ/ton, while non-fossil was 0.0000041 kg Sb-eq/ton. Biotic depletion potential included terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecotoxicity produced 3.0439 kg 1,4-DCB-eq/ton, 0.0452 kg 1,4-DCB-eq/ton, and 0.0630 kg 1,4-DCB-eq/ton, respectively. Carcinogenic and toxicity impacts produced 0.0681 kg 1,4-DCB-eq/ton and 1.966 kg 1,4-DCB-eq/ton. The impact on the water footprint of every ton of LNG was at 2.6387 m3, and land use change was evaluated at 0.0883 m3a corp-eq. Analysis of cumulative energy demand identified that the LNG plant needs only non-renewable energy. The specific energy consumption is 29,151.056 MJ/ton. Conclusions: This study identified that the hotspots included the steam generation unit in Utility II and sour gas absorption in all studied trains. Steam generation produces more CO2, NOx, and SOx emissions. Besides, the utility applied phosphate and boiler feed water. The process of sour gas adsorption needs electricity and polydimethylsiloxane as an adsorbent. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

This article develops and applies a cost-benefit analysis model to develop potential business cases for selective collection and mechanical recycling scenarios of nonhousehold end-use plastic film waste from urban areas considering the City of Ghent in Belgium and 12 municipalities nearby as a case study. Three different collection frequencies (weekly, fortnightly, and monthly) and two different mechanical recycling plant layouts (basic and advanced configuration) are considered. Data on waste quantity, composition, and economic parameters are collected from real sampling from urban areas combined with information from the literature. In the most favorable scenarios, results show that the annual costs of collecting and recycling are estimated to be in the range of €635 to €1,445/tonne output, depending on the collection frequencies and plant configurations. Mechanical recycling yields 48-77% regranulates, depending on the plant configuration and feedstock quality. Scale is essential for plastic recycling plant development; a positive net economic balance (ranging from €5 to €537/tonne output) is achieved when at least 10 500 tonnes/year of waste is collected (fortnightly or monthly) and processed. The recycling systems become economically more effective as the processing capacity increases. It is imperative to maintain high feedstock quality as recycling systems become economically less favorable when the residue content in the collected plastic film waste exceeds 30-35%.

The carbon-neutrality target has become a vital goal in this direction. This study examines the importance of green technology and renewable-energy in achieving the target of carbon-neutrality for 18 emerging countries from 1990 to 2018. We have used Cross-sectional auto-regressive distributed lag (CS-ARDL) estimator to investigate the short-run and long-run association among the variables. Further, Augmented Mean Group (AMG) and Common correlated effects mean group (CCEMG) estimators have been used to get robust results. The findings confirm that green technology, renewable energy consumption, urbanization, and corruption-control significantly mitigate carbon emission in both the short-run and the long-run. In contrast, Gross-Domestic Product (GDP), trade, non-renewable energy, energy-import, and energy-intensity are found to increase carbon emission. Further, it is found that renewable energy reduces carbon emission monotonically whereas green technology exhibits a U-shaped effect on carbon emission. Additionally, green technology effectively moderates the relationship between renewable-energy and carbon emission reduction in the long-run. The results of the Dumitrescu-Hurlin causality test indicate a bidirectional causality between green technology innovation and carbon emission while a unidirectional causality is found to exist from renewable energy to carbon emission. Based on these empirical findings, it is suggested that policymakers should strengthen eco-friendly policies, promote green technology and renewable energy, and invest in sustainable sources to achieve the carbon neutrality target. © 2023 International Association for Gondwana Research"

We aimed to determine endoscopic instrument composition and life cycle assessment (LCA) and to assess a sustainability proposal based on a mark on the instruments that identifies parts can be safely recycled or € green mark'. Design Material composition analysis and LCA of forceps, snares and clips from four different manufacturers (A-D) were performed with four different methods. Carbon footprint from production, transportation and end of life of these instruments was calculated. In 30 consecutive procedures, we marked the contact point with the working channel. 5 cm away from that point was considered as green mark. One-week prospective study was conducted with 184 procedures evaluating 143 instruments (75 forceps, 49 snares and 19 haemoclips) to assess the efficacy of this recyclable mark. Results Composition from different manufacturers varied widely. Most common materials were high global warming potential (GWP) waste (polyethylene, polypropylene and acrylonitrile) and low GWP waste (stainless steel). Significant differences were found for the forceps (0.31-0.47 kg of CO 2 equivalent (CO 2 -eq)) and haemoclips (0.41-0.57 kg CO 2 -eq) between the manufacturers. Green mark was established 131.26 cm for gastroscope and 195.32 cm for colonoscope. One-week activity produced 67.74 kg CO 2 -eq. Applying our sustainability intervention, we could reduce up to 27.44% (18.26 kg CO 2 -eq). This allows the recycling of 61.7% of the instrument total weight (4.69 kg). Conclusion Knowledge of carbon footprint is crucial to select the most sustainable alternatives because there are large variations between brands. A mark to identify recyclable parts could reduce our environmental impact significantly. © 2023 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved."

The options examined included turbo-expansion and ejection. Thermomechanical exergy values were calculated for material streams and exergy losses and efficiencies were estimated for dedicated equipment used in the LTS. The lowest exergy loss of 4221.2 kW was obtained using turbo-expansion and electricity cogeneration. The carbon release associated with each scenario was calculated while considering different production rates, technological parameters and natural decreases in wellhead pressure. The integral carbon footprint after 40 years of LTS operation was estimated for all cases. A classical ejector-based LTS scheme was shown to produce 1200 t of CO2 emissions over 40 years of operation. This same scheme combined with a turboexpander and electricity generator produced 59% less CO2 in the same period. An expansion-cogeneration LTS scheme was found to be the most effective and ecologically friendly among the various options based on this analysis. © 2022 Chinese Petroleum Society"

Over its life cycle, the assessed carbon footprint of silicon-based photovoltaic energy published in the literature often ranges from 40 to 110 gCO2eq/kWh. However, most of these estimations rely on life cycle inventory (LCI) data that represent the early-stage performance of the photovoltaic industry. Indeed, collecting LCI data is time-consuming and practitioners often reuse existing outdated data, which becomes problematic as the photovoltaic industry has been rapidly and significantly evolving. This analysis relies on the parametrization of existing LCI data to better account for the progress already accomplished by the photovoltaic industry. A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) model, called PARASOL_LCA, is thus developed. The results of the analysis highlight that the use of outdated LCI data leads to an overestimation of environmental impacts of photovoltaic energy by a factor of 2 or even more for the best current available technologies. The analysis also shows that PARASOL_LCA, with its numerous parameters, can also serve to assess the environmental performance of prospective photovoltaic technologies and to identify impact reduction levers through sensitivity analysis. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Design/methodology/approach: An observational cross-sectional study was conducted with a convenience sampling consisting of school snacks from a Portuguese municipality. The nutritional assessment used food labels and a Portuguese food composition table. The literature review for carbon footprint assessment was conducted by searching for the products under analysis or similar ones. Findings: The results showed that 80% of snacks have a higher energy value than recommended. The majority of options are below recommendations for protein and fat and above recommendations for carbohydrates. The intermediated meals with more dairy products in composition have the highest carbon footprint. The carbon footprint included the packaging of the products, and it wasn't possible to determine the influence of non-food products. Research limitations/implications: This study has limitations in the fact that we do not know the carbon footprint of Portuguese products and we had to compare them with others, from different countries, with possibly different types of production. Practical implications: Intermediate meals are inadequate, and the carbon footprint is higher when the intermediated meals include products of animal origin – the reason why the composition of intermediated meals should be redesigned considering the achievement of these targets. Social implications: The promotion of intermediated meals that promote the Mediterranean eating pattern contributes to health and well-being and is a vehicle for nutrition education and healthy food consumption in schools. Originality/value: Many studies have been conducted to analyse the carbon footprint and environmental impact of school meals, but commonly lunch is the meal evaluated and the assessment of intermediated meals' impact is an open field. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Although various studies have evaluated the mechanism of a single agronomic management practice to increase yield and production efficiency and decrease environmental costs, few have investigated the effects of IAPM systems. A field experiment was conducted using four IAPM systems, a local smallholder farmers’ practice system (T1), an improved management system (T2), a high-yield production system (T3), and an optimized management system (OMS), to study the annual yield, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, carbon (C) footprint (CF), and net environmental ecological benefit (NEEB) of summer maize. The results revealed that OMS was the most advantageous choice of IAPM, which increased yield and NUE and reduced GHG emissions and CF. Under OMS, yield and NUE were 42.6% and 88.1% higher, and N2O, CO2, and CH4 emissions were on average 35.4%, 5.8%, and 156.5% lower, respectively, than those under T1. Of the four IAPM systems, OMS resulted in the best soil quality, the lowest soil bulk density, the highest soil C/N ratio, and the highest soil total organic C content, which contributed to reduced GHG emissions. Carbon footprint and cost were the lowest under OMS, which decreased fertilizer input and GHG emissions. Optimized management system reduced CF and C cost by 5.9% and 33.9%, respectively, and increased NEEB by 111.4% compared to T1. Although T3 had the highest yield, it also had the highest GHG emissions and CF. In conclusion, OMS delivered a high yield and NUE while mitigating negative environmental impacts and increasing NEEB. Therefore, OMS is a suitable management system to increase the productivity and sustainability of summer maize. © 2023 Soil Science Society of China"

The performance criteria of the proposed SOFC/AMTEC/APC hybrid system are mathematically derived using thermodynamic, exergoeconomic, and exergoenvironment-based carbon footprint analysis. Extensive parametric assessment is carried out to evaluate the effect of substantial design parameters on the system's performance criteria. Furthermore, the multi-objective salp swarm algorithm (MSSA) with decision-making techniques is performed to ascertain the hybrid system's maximum power density and minimum cost and environmental impact rates densities. Findings depict the effectiveness and merit of the proposed system with 81% power density improvement compared with the related SOFC-based system. Moreover, the system yields the maximum power density of 9589.37 W/m2, and the corresponding energy and exergy efficiencies are obtained by 55.2% and 57.74%, indicating 59.26% and 53.76% improvements relative to the single SOFC.

It is assumed that the transition to a “circular plastic economy” should resolve environmental issues for the industry, simultaneously eliminating its dependence on petroleum feedstock. In this work, the authors attempted to untangle the concept of “circular plastics” and assess its potential impact on the market of liquid hydrocarbons. Even in the Moderate scenario, the “circular plastics economy” does become an important factor in demand for hydrocarbons in petrochemical industry, reducing it by 5–10% of the business-as-usual case by 2050 and greatly slowing down demand growth rates after 2045, and the more drastic scenario even sees hydrocarbon demand peak by 2040. These findings indicate the importance of taking into account “plastics circularity” when making long-term forecasts of global oil market. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Although the fossil fuel-based power plants are the most dependable options in these off-grid establishments, almost two-thirds of the burnt fuel to generate electric power is discarded as heat through the various streams. Identifying this scenario, the present study conducts a numerical analysis on preheating the mine intake air with the heat wasted through the jacket water of these power generation units. A MATLAB-based thermodynamically coupled code was developed to assess the techno-economic viability of the proposed concept. Parametric studies on the effectiveness of heat exchanging units showed that investing in the improvement of the heat delivery devices would be more important than the heat recovery units. Sensitivity analysis conducted on the diesel power generation, intake airflow rate of the mine, and modified heating degree days of the remote location established the necessary degree of confidence in the results obtained from the investigation. Analysis indicated that a typical off-grid mine in northern Canada could save around two-thirds of the fossil fuel burning for heating purposes and reduce the associated carbon emissions. © 2023, Society for Mining, Metallurgy & Exploration Inc."

The aim of the paper was to empirically test the relationship between economic and ecological effects related to the increase in Bitcoin’s network hashrate in a selection of countries that have the highest influx of crypto-mining. To test these three hypotheses, I collected a dataset concerning Bitcoin indicators, economic indicators and ecological indicators that were obtained from multiple trustworthy sources: OECD, World Bank, Fred Data, World Inequality Database (WID). Handling the data challenges, I used this unique panel dataset to explore the relationship between Bitcoin’s hashrate and two types of outcomes: (i) economic outcomes where inequalities may emerge or direct measures of inequality (such as the GDP, income inequality (GINI) and the share of people with top 1% of income and 1% of wealth), and (ii) ecological outcomes (such as carbon emissions, carbon footprint and electronic waste). I found that the Bitcoin currency is associated with a certain redistribution of wealth but, it itself remains concentrated in the wealth of the top 1%. Also, there is evidence for certain nonlinearities in the relationships with the ecological degradation, echoing the concept of the Kuznets curve. © 2023, European Regional Science Association.

There will be many shifts in the energy sector as a result of digitization. Hence, we aim analyzing the linkage between digitalization and environment sustainability by incorporating energy consumption as a moderating factor using data of UK from 1990 to 2020. Different dimensions of digitalization are used as explanatory variables, ecological and carbon footprints are used as outcomes and energy consumption is used as moderator. The findings of autoregressive distributed lag model show that internet users and technological advancement (fixed telephone subscription and mobile cellular) are negatively (positively) linked with ecological and carbon footprints. Energy consumption causes to enhance ecological and carbon footprints and plays an antagonistic role in the nexus of internet users, technological advancement, and ecological and carbon footprints. The effects of mobile cellular and fixed telephone subscription have increased in the presence of energy consumption as moderator which exhibits that energy consumption plays an enhancing role in the links between mobile cellular, fixed telephone subscription and ecological and carbon footprints. The results underscore the importance of taking a holistic approach to addressing the environmental impact of digital technologies. By promoting sustainable communication practices and investing in the development of more energy-efficient technologies, practitioners, managers, and society as a whole can work together to reduce the carbon and ecological footprints of digital technologies and create a more sustainable future for all. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Using telemedicine for bariatric surgery evaluations decreases emissions and reduces patient burden during the multiple required interdisciplinary visits. After adopting telemedicine during COVID, our clinic continues to utilize telemedicine for preoperative bariatric evaluations. We evaluated the reduced environmental impact associated with this practice. Methods: A retrospective review of all new evaluations for vertical sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or Roux-en Y gastric bypass (RYGB) from 2019 and 2021 was conducted. The 2019 year represents pre-pandemic, in-person evaluations and 2021 represents telemedicine evaluations during the COVID pandemic. Carbon emissions were calculated using the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) validated formula of 404g CO2 per car-mile. Preoperative evaluation time was calculated from the initial clinic visit to the operation date. Results: There were 51 patients in the 2019 cohort and 55 patients in the 2021 cohort. In the 2019 in-person cohort, there was significantly more kg of estimated CO2 emitted (10,225 vs. 2011.4, p<.001) compared to the 2021 cohort. For time required to complete the preoperative workup, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups (162 days vs. 193 days, p=.226). The attrition rate was lower in the 2021 cohort (22.22% v. 35.9%, p<.001). Conclusions: Implementation of telemedicine for bariatric preoperative evaluations reduced patient travel, carbon emissions, and improved attrition rate. We encourage bariatric providers to use telemedicine as we believe this eases patient burdens and, with wider adoption, could significantly reduce our carbon footprint.

The index comprises several crucial indicators: Control of Corruption, Government Effectiveness, Political Stability, Regulatory Quality, Rule of Law, and Voice and Accountability. The study raises the importance of energy efficiency in terms of energy intensity on ecological footprint. The study's findings suggest that without robust institutional mechanisms, the potential of financial development depth, stability, and efficiency to improve ecological well-being may not be fully realized. However, the study concludes that these institutional mechanisms positively impact mitigating the ecological footprint. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Consequently, this study examines the components of green road construction practices in developing countries such as Ghana. Design/methodology/approach: Using a quantitative research method, four hypothesised constructs identified from the review of relevant literature were tested. The views of 144 quantity surveyors, civil engineers and project managers within Ghana's three road agencies were elicited using a structured close-ended questionnaire. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) based on the structural equation model (SEM) was adopted in analysing the data obtained. Findings: The study's results reveal that the identified components: sustainable design, materials and resources, stormwater management and energy efficiency, significantly influence green road construction. Practical implications: It reveals the critical elements of sustainable road design and construction, aiding organisations, construction companies and legislators in making informed choices on road design and construction. Originality/value: Results from this study provide empirical evidence lacking in the literature about the main components of green road construction. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."
1124,How do natural resources and economic growth impact load capacity factor in selected Next-11 countries? Assessing the role of digitalization and government stability,Article,Li X.; Sun Y.; Dai J.; Mehmood U.,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,30.0,2023,85670,85684,10.1007/s11356-023-28414-y,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163746577&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-023-28414-y&partnerID=40&md5=9545842c68e2810feb15b39f7af4b7c7,09441344,Scopus,Digitalization; Government stability; Load capacity factor; Natural resources; Sustainability,"With growing environmentalconcerns, everyone’s attention has shifted to how we use our limited materials supplies. Rapid economic expansion is dependent on heavy resource use, decreasing biodiversity and raising the ecological footprints (EF), resulting in a reduction in the load capacity factor (LCF). Because of this, scholars and policymakers are actively looking for approaches to improve the LCF without hindering economic growth (GDP). For similar reasons, this research aims at how the selected next eleven economies improved their LCF from 1990 to 2018 by analyzing the effect of digitalization (DIG), natural resources (NAT), GDP, globalization, and governance. To account for dependence across sections and slope variation, the cross-sectional augmented ARDL model is used in this research. The long-term findings indicate that LCF was diminished by dependence on NAT, globalization, and economic growth and was bolstered by DIG and sound governance. The work recommends that financial and policy support is needed for initiatives such as zero-emission vehicle production and energy-efficient building construction. By offering a line of credit at low interest rates, renewable energy projects can attract domestic and private investors. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

As a result, the use of such gears has been banned or severely restricted in some countries, and there are many proposals to implement such restrictions elsewhere. In this paper, we review the sustainability of bottom trawling with respect to target-species sustainability, impact on benthic communities, bycatch and discards, carbon footprint from fuel use, and impact on carbon sequestration. We compare the impact to other forms of fishing and other food production systems. We show that bottom-trawl and dredge fisheries have been sustained, and where well managed, stocks are increasing. Benthic sedimentary habitats remain in good condition where fishing pressure is well managed and where VME and species of concern can be protected by spatial management. Bycatch is intrinsically high because of the mixed-species nature of benthic communities. The carbon footprint is on average higher than chicken or pork, but much less than beef, and can be much lower than chicken or pork. The impact on carbon sequestration remains highly uncertain. Overall, the concerns about trawling impacts can be significantly mitigated when existing technical gear and management measures (e.g. gear design changes and spatial controls) are adopted by industry and regulatory bodies and the race-to-fish eliminated. When these management measures are implemented, it appears that bottom trawling would have a lower environmental impact than livestock or fed aquaculture, which would likely replace trawl-caught fish if trawling was banned. A total of 83 bottom-trawl fisheries are currently certified by the Marine Stewardship Council, which is the most widely accepted measure of overall sustainability.  © 2023 The Author(s)."
1126,Vital role of clinicians in reducing the NHS carbon footprint through smarter procurement decisions,Article,Al-Hadithy N.; Knight K.; Gopfert A.; Van Hove M.; Villa Garcia X.,BMJ Leader,8.0,2023,43,48,10.1136/leader-2022-000722,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85168287482&doi=10.1136%2fleader-2022-000722&partnerID=40&md5=ca0f2a61ab97891113e057dbb0406866,2398631X,Scopus,clinical leadership; health policy; productivity; sustainability,"Background The NHS' impact on the environment is significant, accounting for 5.9% of the national carbon footprint of the UK and 20 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO 2 e) emissions a year. The procurement of goods and services is responsible for 72% of the NHS carbon footprint - equivalent to 15.2Mt CO 2 e. Procurement is, therefore, a priority focus area to consider, if carbon reductions are to be made. The impact of procurement decisions extends over the € whole life' - from identification of the need for a product or service through to the provision of the product or service and including the product's € end of life' process (disposal). From April this year, any new procurement needs to have a 10% net zero and social value weighting. From April 2023 onward, any new procurement two times per day should incorporate carbon footprint and environmental impact. This paper aims to introduce clinicians to the concept of green procurement and illustrate the potential greenhouse gases savings possible if procurement decisions were informed by the sustainability credentials such as the carbon footprint of a product or the corporate social responsibility programme of the supplier. Methods While seconded at the Department of Health and Social Care, the senior author on this paper collaborated with the NHS Supply Chain to pilot carbon footprinting of one clinical item. We chose to focus on the 20-gauge € pink' cannula as a high-volume familiar article; 25 million cannulas are purchased via the NHS Supply Chain each year, of which the most commonly used size is the 20 gauge. Results Of the seven companies approached, five sent us their CSR strategies. Four companies provided product primary data, and of these four, one provided sufficient data to carry out a carbon footprint analysis. The one set of detailed data provided was for two 20-gauge cannulas, 1 with wings and 1 without. The total carbon footprint for Cannula 1 is 33.92 g CO 2 e. The total carbon footprint for Cannula 2 is 35.45 g CO 2 e. This amounts to a 1.54 g CO 2 e difference between the 2 cannulas. Conclusion It is both necessary and possible for the NHS to demonstrate leadership in reducing the carbon footprint of healthcare.We have provided an overview of NHS procurement to empower clinicians to get involved with local and national decision-making. We have demonstrated the potential carbon savings that could be made through careful choice of products. We have also highlighted the risks if clinicians do not engage with green procurement. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ."

So far, it presents tremendous potential for applications in realizing desalination of seawater or brine, wastewater treatment, and so forth. However, the precipitated salt particles during conventional ISVG inevitably block the evaporator surface, resulting in the degradation of photothermal conversion and decrease of evaporation rate. Herein, a multi-functional non-contact Janus hollow evaporator based on copper foam was prepared, which was assembled by a hydrophobic light-to-heat conversion layer and a hydrophilic interfacial water evaporation layer as two separate parts. Accordingly, the precipitated salt in the ISVG system does not block the photothermal interface, increasing the stability of solar capture and reusability of the evaporator. Notably, the hollow structure of the evaporator has a local interfacial heating effect, endowing the evaporation system with a high seawater evaporation rate of 2.249 kg m-2 h-1. The evaporator is capable of stable operation for 10 h under 1 sun illumination even when evaporating concentrated brine (15 wt %). Moreover, the evaporation rate of water under one sun irradiation reached 2.284 kg m-2 h-1 and the solar-to-vapor efficiency reached 96.6%. Not only that, the evaporator was able to successfully purify wastewater containing dyes and heavy metal ions. The multi-functional Janus hollow interfacial solar evaporator will provide inspiration for upcoming research on the production of safety water. © 2023 American Chemical Society."

Nowhere is this experienced more than in the information technology (IT) industry, given its size and impact on consumers worldwide. The IT industry is rapidly changing with the evolution of cloud computing, artificial intelligence, big data, and the expansion of 5G networks resulting in the creation of massive quantities of information. Industry analysts estimate that the amount of data created, captured, or replicated will grow from 33 Zettabytes (ZB) in 2018 to 175 ZB by 2025. Given the focus on sustainability and the large volumes of storage devices required to store the growing quantities of data in the coming years, organizations have an opportunity to reduce their carbon footprint, improve sustainability, and reduce expenses by migrating less frequently accessed (cold data) from hard disk drive (HDD)-based storage to modern tape storage. Industry analysts believe that 60%-80% of the data stored on HDDs is cold data. Consider a hypothetical example of assessing just the impact of the storage media of keeping 100 Pbyte of information for 10 years. Compared to an HDD-only solution, an active archive that moved 60% of the HDD resident data to tape reduced carbon emissions by 58%, reduced electronic waste (eWaste) by 51%, and reduced the total cost of ownership (TCO) by 46%. In addition, if all the data is cold and is transferred to tape, carbon emissions are reduced by 97%, eWaste is decreased by 85%, and TCO is lowered by 78%. Globally, moving 60% of the HDD resident data to tape could reduce global carbon emissions by 79 million tons, making a meaningful contribution to reducing global carbon emissions. For enterprises, the financial benefits are significant enough to raise the possibility of funding the migration project entirely by the TCO savings while helping reduce global carbon emissions and eWaste. © 2002 Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers, Inc."

Renewable sources of energy can provide ecological advantages, particularly when contrasted with fossil fuels, which emit high levels of CO2 emissions. Thus, the research explores the impact of eco-innovation (ECO), green energy (REC), and globalization (GLOB) on the ecological footprint (ECF) in the BRICS nations using the panel nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (PNARDL) technique between 1990 and 2018. The empirical results indicate that there is cointegration in the model. The results from the PNARDL show that a positive shift in renewable energy, eco-innovation, and globalization decreases the ecological footprint, while positive (negative) shifts in non-renewable energy and economic growth intensify the ecological footprint. The paper suggests several policy recommendations based on these results. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

The country's heavy reliance on coal, oil, and natural gas, as well as its rapidly growing demand for energy, have contributed to air and water pollution, soil erosion, and other environmental problems. To address these issues, China must transition to cleaner and more sustainable forms of energy and implement policies to reduce energy demand and promote conservation. This paper explores the impacts of total primary energy supply and energy use on environmental degradation in China, using international trade and economic growth as moderating variables from 1971 to 2019. The results indicate that the total primary energy supply is significant at a 1% significance level, which suggests that it strongly impacts the ecological footprint. Energy use and international trade are significant at a 5% level, indicating that they also influence ecological footprint, albeit to a lesser extent. Economic growth is significant at a 1% significance level, suggesting a strong positive association with the ecological footprint. Energy supply improves the environment in China, whereas energy use degrades the environment. Policymakers should focus on promoting energy efficiency in the industrial and transportation sectors. This can be achieved through the implementation of energy-saving technologies, the promotion of public transportation, and the development of low-carbon transportation systems. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Our research builds on the panel data analysis for 37 countries during 2010–2018, adopting local projections proposed by Jordá (Am Econ Rev 95(1):161–182, 2005), a feasible alternative to panel VAR estimation in case of short time series. In order to account for potentially different patterns in the relationship among the indicators, we split the whole panel into two sub-panels, using K-means clusterization based on income level, resource abundance, and overall environmental performance. For the whole panel, the carbon footprint is driven by systemic risk, while leading the non-performing loans (NPL) ratio and Z-score. Thus, curbing systemic risk matters to reduce the carbon footprint of bank loans. Otherwise, it may amplify the effects of the latter on the NPL ratio and Z-score. Interestingly, the effect of systemic risk on the carbon footprint stems from the sub-panel consisting of developed countries, while the effect of the carbon footprint on the NPL ratio and Z-score is mainly shaped by developing and emerging market economies. The relationships between the carbon footprint of lending, concentration, and profitability are much less pronounced both for the whole panel and for the sub-panels. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

While reducing CO2e footprints is one of the ultimate goals of such efforts, CO2e output is a secondary measure of system performance that when focused on too narrowly can create perverse incentives to invest resources inefficiently or take unilateral actions that have unintended negative consequences. The source of this misplaced focus on CO2e is largely the result of marketing efforts that emphasize the reduction of carbon footprints, mostly through renewable energy procurement, as the primary means of reducing impact. The procurement of renewable energy and related carbon intensity metrics, whether in the form of standards or corporate reporting, are of little value to system designers and operators in understanding how to reduce the environmental impact of IT systems and infrastructure. As just one example, research on mesh content delivery network (CDN) delivery has demonstrated techniques that reduced energy consumption by more than 50%, which would not be reflected in standard CO2emissions reporting. By focusing on energy proportionality and techniques that reduce and adjust energy consumption, designers, and operators can create a direct impact on CO2e emissions while also increasing efficiency and reducing costs. Further research and development as well as collaboration on industry standards that go beyond CO2e reporting is vital to reducing industry-wide internet and communications technology (ICT) environmental impacts. © 2002 Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers, Inc."

Sustainable multiblock copolymer elastomers (MBCPEs) have received tremendous interest due to their unprecedented performance and huge potential applications. However, complex multistep polymerization and postpolymerization processes are needed to design MBCPEs. In this work, a series of MBCPEs, in which vanillin acrylate (VA) derived from lignin was selected as the renewable rigid segments for the glassy block, while methyl acrylate (MA) was chosen as the soft segments for the rubbery block, were prepared by two successive reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization processes with polytrithiocarbonate (PTTC). These thermally stable MBCPEs exhibit distinct microphase-separated morphology, where the hard poly(vanillin acrylate) (PVA) blocks self-assemble into discrete glassy domains serving as the physical cross-linking points in the soft poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA) matrix. The macroscopic mechanical performance, such as tensile strength, stretchability, toughness, and elastic recovery, can be adjusted well by changing the molecular weights and PVA contents. Moreover, these sustainable MBCPEs can be applied as strong adhesives and excellent UV-shielding materials, broadening their potential applications. This novel strategy is convenient and robust by combining RAFT polymerization and renewable resources toward high-performance MBCPEs, which can open a new avenue for the development of sustainable biobased elastomers. © 2023 American Chemical Society."

Studying domestication in fungi has thus both fundamental and applied interest. Genomic studies have revealed the existence of four populations within the blue-cheese-making fungus Penicillium roqueforti. The two cheese populations show footprints of domestication, but the adaptation of the two non-cheese populations to their ecological niches (i.e., silage/spoiled food and lumber/spoiled food) has not been investigated yet. Here, we reveal the existence of a new P. roqueforti population, specific to French Termignon cheeses, produced using small-scale traditional practices, with spontaneous blue mould colonisation. This Termignon population is genetically differentiated from the four previously identified populations, providing a novel source of genetic diversity for cheese making. The Termignon population indeed displayed substantial genetic diversity, both mating types, horizontally transferred regions previously detected in the non-Roquefort population, and intermediate phenotypes between cheese and non-cheese populations. Phenotypically, the non-Roquefort cheese population was the most differentiated, with specific traits beneficial for cheese making, in particular higher tolerance to salt, to acidic pH and to lactic acid. Our results support the view that this clonal population, used for many cheese types in multiple countries, is a domesticated lineage on which humans exerted strong selection. The lumber/spoiled food and silage/spoiled food populations were not more tolerant to crop fungicides but showed faster growth in various carbon sources (e.g., dextrose, pectin, sucrose, xylose and/or lactose), which can be beneficial in their ecological niches. Such contrasted phenotypes between P. roqueforti populations, with beneficial traits for cheese-making in the cheese populations and enhanced ability to metabolise sugars in the lumber/spoiled food population, support the inference of domestication in cheese fungi and more generally of adaptation to anthropized environments. © 2023 The Authors.

However, research on soil stability through the use of cleaner materials and environmentally friendly binders with a lower carbon footprint has garnered a lot of attention in recent years due to the significant carbon emissions in cement manufacturing. In this study, the strength and microstructural characteristics of lateritic soil stabilized with bamboo leaf ash (BLA) and rice husk ash (RHA) were examined. The soil sample underwent preliminary examinations and California bearing ratio tests as part of the testing process (CBR). The soil sample was then individually mixed with BLA and RHA at 2% intervals in proportions of 0-16%, as well as cement in variable proportions of 0-12% at 2% intervals. The blends were tested for CBR at each stage. The greatest values for unsoaked and soaked CBR at 8% cement +8% RHA were 92.3% and 70.2%, and 90% and 62.2%, respectively, at 8% cement +8% BLA for soaked and unsoaked CBR. SEM and X-ray diffraction (XRD) tests were performed on samples that had reached these ideal CBR levels. According to the results, new compounds were created and the microstructural layouts changed. Therefore, it may be inferred that the stabilization process involved pozzolanic and cement hydration reactions. © 2023 WITPress. All rights reserved."

Carbon fibre composites and various other radiolucent materials currently in use were also compared in terms of their radiolucency. It was found that the jute composites not only performed exceptionally well but also had an extremely low carbon footprint. To improve the mechanical properties, the jute fibres were treated with 5% and 15% KOH using different processes. The main challenge in sizing was the choice of medium and process that would effectively separate the KOH molecules. The paper highlights this in detail. The jute epoxy parts were moulded using a high-density casting process. A modified version of the mixing rule for bidirectional composites was derived. FTIR was used to prove the effectiveness of the surface treatment. ABAQUS modelling was performed for the theoretical prediction of the tensile strength of the composite. The paper highlights that the strength of KOH-treated jute was 32% higher than the untreated jute epoxy. The formulation was done to enhance the moment of inertia and performance under high bending stress. The theoretical analysis was performed for the bending moment. It can be concluded that the design was sufficient for different patient sizes with a maximum mass of 250 kg, using a FOS (factor of safety) of 1.2. Finally, a prototype was created to validate the theoretical results. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to the Korean Fiber Society."

As economic production and services have a significant impact on the environment, they play a fundamental role in supporting the global sustainable development goals (SDGs). Despite this, little attention has been paid to environmental impact driven by the final demand of global finance and business sector (i.e., environmental footprint). In this paper, we estimated the carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and particular matter 10 (PM10) footprints of finance and business sector of 187 economies from 2000 to 2016 using a global multi-regional input–output model. Our results show that global environmental footprints peaked 10 years ago, and the latest CO2, SO2 and PM10 footprints are approximately 1371, 8.2 and 6.1 million tons, respectively. We also found that 99% of environmental footprints originate from 20% economy-sectors, and the critical economy-sectors are identified. In addition, policy interventions on environmental intensity, production efficiency and trade network for mitigating the environmental footprints are proposed as well.

These among other things have been exacerbated as a result of climate change, environmental impacts, and capital costs. Hence, meeting the per capita energy demand in SSA is very difficult. In this study, we investigated the potential of integrating floating solar photovoltaic panels and wind farms for sustainable energy generation in an existing hydropower station in Nigeria. The mix of renewable energy will enable conservation and reuse of water, reduce the energy carbon footprint, and lower start-up costs. Using a novel Open standalone application package within the open energy modelling framework (oemof) group, feedinlib, the energy production from both floating photovoltaic and wind turbine systems was evaluated from 2016 to 2019. The deployment of floating photovoltaic on 0.05% of the Kainji reservoir was found to generate as much as 50% of the installed capacity of the hydropower. Our results suggest that increasing the coverage area of the floating photovoltaic system can generate sufficient energy to meet about 70% of the country’s energy needs. The mix of photovoltaic and wind turbine systems was found to play complementary roles in meeting the per capita energy needs. Based on these findings, SSA can achieve sustainable energy goals by investing in renewable energy.

The load capacity factor (LF) is a more extensive measure of environmental deterioration when compared to carbon emissions and the ecological footprint, which cover a range of both the demand on and supply of nature. The series dataset used for the empirical analysis spans between 1990 and 2019. The study also investigates the effect of human capital, industrialization, and economic growth on load capacity factor. The result of the NARDL estimator reveals that the increase in renewable electricity energy usage increases LF in the long and short term. However, the decline in renewable electricity energy usage has a neutral impact on LF. Furthermore, the results indicate that industrialization and economic growth impact LF negatively. Lastly, human capital improves environmental quality due to the increasing effect on LF. The spectral Granger causality approach outcomes show that all the parameters can forecast load capacity factors in the long term. Some policy implications, restrictions, and potential future study pathways have been explored in light of this paper's results. © 2023"

Users listen to music videos rather than watch them. This is environmentally suboptimal since video data require more energy than audio data to be hosted and transmitted. Why are consumers using a video platform to stream music? In this paper, we sketch a framework for analyzing digital practices as consumption practices and their transformation in the context of the ecological transition. We interviewed 29 online music consumers from varied backgrounds. Drawing on practice theory, we conceptualize online music use as a combination of sociotechnical configurations articulating listening devices, types of attention to music, and the social contexts of daily life. We analyze how different platforms, especially YouTube, are embedded in specific configurations. We first establish that configurations in which videos are actually watched are rare. Though users are aware of the carbon footprint of streaming, this representation does not inform their listening configurations. We describe three types of online music practices according to the role YouTube plays in, that correlate with music passion: YouTube can be framed as a free and open listening platform (especially to casual listeners), as an efficient soundtracking device in many contexts, as a useful complementary listening and music sharing device. The paper extends the literature on green consumption to digital consumption, analyzing relations to infrastructures in a regime of abundance, and contributes to the sociology of online music consumption, showing how platform choices are linked with music passion and embedded in social contexts. © The Author(s) 2022."

To further clarify whether or not natural resource rent affects environmental sustainability, this study investigates the potential impact of natural resource rent on environmental sustainability by addressing the interaction effect of urbanization and natural resource rent for data spanning from 1971 to 2017 in the context of Pakistan. Ecological footprint, carbon emissions, and carbon footprint are used as indicators for environmental sustainability. The application of the dynamic autoregressive distributive lag method infers that the natural resource rent contributes to carbon emission and alternatively urbanization helps pollution mitigation. The interaction between urbanization and natural resource rent plays a moderating role in reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, ecological and carbon footprint. The co-efficient value of natural resources, urbanization and interaction effect of urbanization with natural resource ranging from 0.021 to 0.788; 0.287 to 1.689 and 0.033 to 0.320, respectively.

As a result, to ensure a healthy and sustainable energy future, it is imperative to warrant reliable and diverse energy supply sources if the “green energy economy” is to be realized. The purpose of developing and deploying clean energy technologies is to improve our overall energy security, reduce our carbon footprint, and ensure that the generation of energy is secure and reliable in the future, making sure that we can spur economic growth in the future. In this paper, advancements in alternative sources of energy sustainability and strategies will be examined to ensure there will be enough fuel to supply all the future demands for energy. Several emerging clean energy technologies rely heavily on the availability of materials that exhibit unique properties that are necessary for their development. This paper examines the roles that rare earth and other energy-critical materials play in securing a clean energy economy and the development of clean energy economies in general. For the development of these technologies to be successful and sustainable, a number of these energy-critical materials are at risk of becoming unavailable. This is due to their limited availability, disruptions in supply, and a lack of suitable resources for their development. An action plan focusing on producing energy-critical materials in energy-efficient ways is discussed as part of an initiative to advance the development of clean and sustainable energy. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

While minimizing the preprocessing of lignocellulosic fillers leads to an increase in the sustainability of the overall composite and a decrease of the carbon footprint, filler modification is usually indispensable to obtaining sufficient mechanical and thermomechanical properties of a composite. The goal of the presented study was a comprehensive analysis of the structure, mechanical and thermal performance of polyethylene-based (PE) composites with spent coffee grounds (FK) and cocoa husks (KK). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements showed the antioxidant activity of both fillers, extending the oxidation induction time by 100% (54 min) compared to pure PE (20 min). Composites with up to 5 wt% of the filler were characterized by low porosity (0.5%) and revealed tensile strength of about 20 MPa, which is comparable with the results of unmodified PE. However, the materials' ductility was affected, reducing elongation at break and tensile toughness by two orders of magnitude. In order to quantify changes in adhesion at the interface, a comprehensive analysis of thermomechanical parameters based on dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was carried out, including the assessment of interactions on the interface of the composite caused by the increase in free volume inside composites' structure.

This is true even despite the current technological, economic and political barriers to its large-scale use. This paper proposes a concept of combining two technologies for producing hydrogen - partial oxidation of methane with oxygen and water electrolysis, a byproduct of which is oxygen. The analysis and evaluation of the proposed scheme showed that: 1) the synergy of water electrolysis and methane partial oxidation technologies allows the production of hydrogen with a low carbon footprint; 2) the hybrid system allows optimizing electricity and natural gas consumption using energy demand management technologies; 3) the technology synergy allows using excess thermal energy released during methane partial oxidation to increase the electrolysis temperature and its efficiency; 4) it was found that LCOH of the proposed system is 4.66 USD/kg that meets the average estimates in existing studies. At the same time, breakeven price of the project is 9.658 USD/kg H2, which is too high to be competitive without state support. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC"

A promising alternative to BEVs to reduce CO2 emissions, while maintaining an existing and well-developed technology, could be the use of hydrogen for internal combustion engines (ICEs). Particularly, the zero-carbon content of hydrogen allows for guaranteeing very clean combustion and near-zero carbon footprint. Within this context, the present study aims to deeply investigate the effects of pure hydrogen fueling of Spark Ignition (SI) engines, especially on specific fuel consumption and NOx emissions. Particularly, the benefits of pure hydrogen fueling were assessed in a production small Direct Injection (DI) SI engine. The engine is intended to operate in steady state conditions as an Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) for a series hybrid powertrain. The effects of pure hydrogen fueling were investigated at two engine speeds, namely 2000 and 3000 rpm. All tests were carried out at unthrottled conditions and lean mixture. A 1-D engine model was developed within a commercial software. Combustion, heat transfer, and NOx emissions embedded sub-models were tuned based on the experimental data, to accurately reproduce the engine behavior in a wide range of operating conditions. Both experimental and simulation results demonstrated that hydrogen fueling, together with lean mixture operation, allow for significantly improving engine thermal efficiency. The results of 1-D model simulations supported the energy management strategies of the hybrid powertrain in selecting the most suitable ICE operating condition. Particularly, the best engine operating conditions in terms of fuel consumption are achieved at 2500 rpm, with λ = 2.0, while the lowest NOx emissions are reached when λ is increased up to 2.4. © IMechE 2023."

Anaerobic digestion is a viable method for producing bioenergy in the form of biogas from biomass. The anaerobic digestion process is challenged with low biogas recovery, and low-quality effluent or CO2 emission, which contribute to environmental pollution and the carbon footprint in the atmosphere. Computational process modelling and simulation can provide realistic information for dealing with the technological challenges involved with anaerobic digestion. In this study, modeling and simulation of the simplified anaerobic digestion process were done using SuperPro Designer software fed with biomass feedstock containing carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, as well as yeast, at 37 °C mesophilic temperature. The anaerobic digestion process yielded 89.655% of CH4 and 10.345% of CO2 and confirmed that the carbohydrate feedstock produces more CH4 composition in the biogas. Mineralization of CO2 using MgO yielded 0.23% MgCO3, consuming > 99% of the CO2 produced during the anaerobic digestion process. Environmental impact assessment of the effluent discharge yielded 0.142 kg Slds/L volatile solid with 6.01% COD reduction per batch of the anaerobic digestion process in an anaerobic digester with 90% (1.925 kg/batch) feedstock dosage. The data indicate that single-batch effluent cannot be discharged into the environment, hence indicating the possible recycling for multiple anaerobic digestion processing. The results are a significant guide for the realistic scalable production of high-quality biogas for bioenergy application, CO2 mineralization, and environmental remediation. © 2023, The Author(s)."

However, the drawback of the coking deposition limits the process of the above strategy. Here, we synthesis a Ni-based catalyst with high conversion rates (∼88% for CO2 and ∼89% for CH4) and excellent stability (>160 h at 700 °C) proceeded by Ce doping, and further employ it as reforming layer on solid oxide fuel cell.

The healthcare sector is responsible for substantial environmental pollution. Most healthcare systems rely on economic evaluation to select efficient alternatives. Nevertheless, environmental spillovers of healthcare treatments are rarely considered whether it is from a cost or a health perspective. The objective of this article is to identify economic evaluations of healthcare products and guidelines that have included any environmental dimensions. Methods: Electronic searches of 3 literature databases (PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE) and official health agencies guidelines were conducted. Documents were considered eligible if they assessed the environmental spillovers within the economic evaluation of a healthcare product or provided any recommendations on the inclusion of environmental spillovers in the health technology assessment process. Results: From the 3878 records identified, 62 documents were deemed eligible and 18 were published in 2021 and 2022. The environmental spillovers considered were carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, water or energy consumption, and waste disposal. The environmental spillovers were mainly assessed using the lifecycle assessment (LCA) approach while the economic analysis was mostly limited to costs. Only 9 documents, including the guidelines of 2 health agencies presented theoretical and practical ways to include environmental spillovers into the decision-making process. Conclusions: There is a clear lack of methods on whether environmental spillovers should be included in health economic evaluation and how this should be done. If healthcare systems want to reduce their environment footprint, the development of methodology which integrates environmental dimensions in health technology assessment will be key. © 2023"

Our data from the long-term operation of 85 photovoltaic power plants in central Europe show that their actual lifetime is about half that of the originally planned lifetime. After about 10 years, serious failures of 1st tier (bankable) PV panels occur at an increasing rate. This article presents selected typical data and describes the most serious failures. Furthermore, economic calculations of returns on investment are carried out in relation to the price of electricity, which is currently changing at a rapid pace. It shows that the PV panel lifetime reduction from 20 to 30 years, declared at commercial leaflets, to real lifetime about 10–12 years can reduce PV power plant profit substantially, but the investment is still worth it. The reason is that after 10–12 years ser vice/maintenance expenses to replace damaged PV panels and inverters are growing very quickly. The new information could be helpful for owners of PV power plants to get a more realistic estimation of profits. © 2023 The Author(s)"

Bamboo is being a potential source of bioenergy particularly in the North East States of India; the thermal performance and synergetic behaviour of co-pyrolysis of bamboo with high ash Indian coal are investigated at various heating rates in a thermogravimetric analyser. Three different blend samples (25% bamboo with 75% coal, 50% bamboo with 50% coal and 75% bamboo with 25% coal) are used. The kinetic parameters are determined using three isoconversional methods: Friedman, Ozawa-Flynn-Wall and Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose. Average activation energy for all three blend samples is found in the range of 121–253 kJ/mol. Co-pyrolysis of all three blend samples have revealed some synergistic effect. However, the blend containing 25% of bamboo has shown the highest synergetic effect in terms of thermodynamic parameters. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
1153,Environmental cost of food wastage: Integrated response through a mix of environmental policy instruments,Article,Jain P.; Sarawgi A.; Jain P.,Sustainable Development,31.0,2023,2464,2470,10.1002/sd.2522,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149231194&doi=10.1002%2fsd.2522&partnerID=40&md5=306e8a5b59bf4e36265338147e78e6c7,09680802,Scopus,environmental cost; environmental policy; food wastage; greenhouse gases; sustainable development,"Food, when wasted, reaches landfills and emits greenhouse gases. The impact of greenhouse gases (GHGs), in turn, is felt by even those who do not waste food in the place. Externalities thus created are known to distort market efficiency and the most widely discussed externality is climate change. This study takes the case of United States of America (USA) to ascertain the GHGs resulting due to food wastage. The difference between cost per capita due to emissions from animal-based products and emissions from plant-based products comes out to be $122. In the year 1997 total GHG emission for the entire population of the USA due to food wastage was 401.98 billion kgCO2eq, costing the country 45.42 billion US dollars. Two decades later, in 2017, the food waste costs went up by 6 billion US dollars amounting to 51.14 billion US dollars and 452.64 billion kgCO2eq of GHG emissions The novelty of this research lies in highlighting the carbon footprints of food wastage in terms of GHG's and monetizing these emissions.

The sandwich composite used today are mainly made of conventional synthetic foam cores and synthetic fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) facings, typically made of glass or carbon fibers and synthetic polymers. With increasing environmental consciousness, it is important to develop sustainable building materials to replace conventional building materials with more sustainable materials such as bio-based fibers and polymers. There is lack of studies on sandwich composites made of bio-based materials for both core and facings. In this study, 18 sandwich beam specimens (1200 mm long and 100 mm wide) made of flax FRP facings and 75 mm thick paper honeycomb core were fabricated and tested under three-point bending. The parameters of the tests were facing thickness (1, 2 and 3 layers of flax FRP) and core types (hollow and foam-filled). It was found that the paper honeycomb has comparable performance with lighter weight to other synthetic counterparts and foam-filling was effective in improving the performance of the core and sandwich beams. In addition, as the nonlinear behavior of the specimens was evident, a new analytical model was developed based on the material nonlinearity of both facings and core materials to predict the test data and perform a parametric study. Overall, the bio-based sandwich system showed substantial potential to be used for building applications with much less environmental footprints in comparison with other synthetic counterparts. © 2023 Institution of Structural Engineers"

However, existing bioethanol potential assessments ignore the constraints of limited water resources. Here we quantify the bioethanol potential from twelve crops’ residues and two energy crops (sweet sorghum and cassava) grown on marginal lands under both water and land constraints in China, based on bioethanol water footprint accounting, local water scarcity degree and marginal land identification. Results show that the bioethanol potential from crop residues is up to 68.5 Mt (∼1.8 EJ calorific value), approximately 49% lower than the theoretical potential without considering water limits. The suitable bioethanol potentials from sweet sorghum and cassava are in ranges 18.7–32.7 Mt (∼0.5–0.9 EJ) and 14.0–52.4 Mt (∼0.4–1.4 EJ), respectively. Northeast China are more suitable for the development of bioethanol due to their greater productive potential and lower water scarcity, whereas South and Southwest China have advantages in terms of growing energy crops on marginal lands and should be the focus of additional attention. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

A widely discussed climate policy instrument is carbon taxes. Previous studies of the distributional implications of carbon taxation focused on uniform carbon taxes across sectors. Differentiated tax rates across goods and services received less attention. Here we model an alternative carbon tax design accounting for the distribution of household consumption and carbon footprints across 88 countries covering the global north and south. The policy distinguishes luxury and basic consumption and sets higher carbon prices for luxury. The policy reduces yearly global household emissions by 6% compared with no policy and inequalities are reduced compared with no policy and compared with a uniform carbon tax. By 2050, the policy saves around 100 gigatonnes carbon dioxide equivalents, which is 75% of what is needed for households to remain within a 2° consistent climate pathway. © 2023 The Authors"

Considering that wood is the raw material of paper, the study investigates whether the increase in the consumption of recovered paper has a positive effect on the forest footprint. Therefore, unlike other studies, the dependent variable of the EKC model is the forest footprint. The study is original in that it is the first to analyze the effects of recovered paper consumption on environmental degradation in the context of the EKC hypothesis. To analyze the relationships between the variables, we use panel cointegration tests based on AMG and CCE estimators, which allow analysis on both a country and group basis. According to the results, the EKC hypothesis is valid only in the Netherlands. While there is a statistically significant and negative relationship between recovered paper consumption and forest footprint in the Netherlands, there is a statistically significant and negative relationship between urbanization and forest footprint in Italy. Economic and ecological benefits and costs must be considered to measure the net benefit of waste management programs. In addition, to analyze how environmental impacts change over time, ecological footprint and gas emissions during waste generation or disposal should be measured similarly to carbon emissions. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Iranian Society of Environmentalists (IRSEN) and Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University."

This significantly contributes to global warming and causes negative health and ecosystem effects. Increasing the circularity of plastics can reduce these impacts. This study investigated to which extent plastics' circularity can be increased by mechanical recycling. For this purpose, future scenarios involving increased waste collection, improved product design, and improved waste sorting were assessed. The system studied consists of 11 plastic types in 69 product groups consumed and arising as waste in Switzerland. By means of a material flow analysis, the amounts of consumption, waste, and secondary material utilizable in product manufacturing were quantified for the year 2040. For the waste not mechanically recycled, treatment situations mainly involving energy recovery in waste-to-energy plants and cement kilns were modeled. A life cycle assessment of the complete plastic material flow system was conducted. We found that the mechanical recycling rate calculated based on the utilizable secondary material can be increased to up to 31%. This can lower the plastic carbon footprint by one quarter (1.3% of today's total Swiss carbon footprint) compared to no recycling. Important barriers to a further increase of the recycling rate were inaccessibility, the large diversity of plastic grades, and contamination. The remaining impact at maximum recycling is mainly caused by polyurethanes, polypropylene, and polystyrene production. In conclusion, the potential of mechanical plastic recycling is limited, but it can, as one of several measures, contribute to combating climate change. © 2023 The Authors.

The present study deals with the production of low carbon footprint and lightweight refractory matrices, with controllable pores structures, thermally stable and having low thermal conductivities. The lightweight refractory products were obtained through the direct foaming of geopolymer pastes and sintered from 900 to 1200 °C. The mechanism of pores formation, pores structures and the effect of both sintering temperature and foaming agent ratio on the thermal insulation, physical and microstructural characteristics were evaluated. The results showed that the produced matrices could be described as low thermal conductors, with thermal conductivity values between 0.49 and 0.18 W/mK. The 3D internal pore structures under laser microscopy observations confirms the mechanism of pore enlargement when high concentration of the foaming agent was added. Furthermore, the decomposition of kyanite particles within the matrices, at high temperature, favoured the extend reduction in porosity and the limitation of the liquid phase, by ensuring the formation of macro-porosities sized between 360 μm and 2 mm. The formation of the refractory crystalline phases namely: cordierite, mullite, enstatite, leucite, as well as, kalsilite, acting as filler, ensure thermal stability of the matrices. The produced materials provide an energy-saving, lightweight ceramic foams with high-strength and low thermal conductivities, potential candidates for refractory applications. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l."

An idea to promote hydrogen as an alternative energy emerges from the global energy transition agenda. In this article, our aim is to assess the prospect of hydrogen, as a potential, environmentally friendly, yet expensive and technological-demanding resource, to be developed globally. The scientific novelty of the research consists in systematizing the world experience and Russian practice of implementing energy efficiency projects within the framework of public-private partnership (PPP), substantiating, and forecasting the prospects for the use of this resource in order to decarbonize the economy and solve environmental problems, as well as determining the main directions of the national energy strategy in Russia. We have developed recommendations to eliminate the identified problems that impede the increase in the energy efficiency of industrial production and operation of facilities. It is concluded that the use of “green” hydrogen obtained with the help of renewable energy sources is promising in solving environmental problems and building a climate-neutral economy characterized by zero greenhouse gas emissions.

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a versatile technology, allowing for the precise coating of challenging substrates with a nanometer control over thickness. Due to its unique ability to nanoengineer interfaces and surfaces, ALD is widely used in many applications. Although the ALD technique offers the potential to tackle environmental challenges, in particular, considerations regarding the sustainability of renewable energy devices urge for greater efficiency and lower carbon footprint. Indeed, the process itself has currently a consequential impact on the environment, which should ideally be reduced as the technique is implemented in a wider range of products and applications. This paper reviews the studies carried out on the assessment of the environmental impact of ALD and summarizes the main results reported in the literature. Next, the principles of green chemistry are discussed, considering the specificities of the ALD process. This work also suggests future pathways to reduce the ALD environmental impact; in particular, the optimization of the reactor and processing parameters, the use of high throughput processes such as spatial ALD (SALD), and the chemical design of greener precursors are proposed as efficient routes to improve ALD sustainability. © 2023 The Authors.

Therefore, this study investigates date palm waste leaves which aims to produce environment friendly H2 gas using gasification technology. The results of 25 experimental runs exhibited that the higher H2 produced at higher temperature which was mainly supported by water-gas-shift and steam-methane reforming reactions. H2 prediction was modeled using response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN). The RSM model exhibited a strong interaction with the regression coefficient (R2) and p-value of 0.89 and 0.000000, respectively. ANN data was disseminated thru K-fold contrivance with back-propagation algorithm. Hence, the training (80% data) and validation (20% data) datasets were found with R2 and root mean squared error (RSME) of 0.90 and 0.28, and 0.86 and 0.39, respectively. Kinetics of the process estimated the activation energies (Ea) using Ozawa-Flynn-Wall (OFW), Starink (STK), and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) models. Hence, the values of Ea and R2 at conversion degrees (α) 0.1 to 0.8 were ranged between 129.40 and 326.64 kJ/mol and 0.92 to 0.97, respectively. Optimum H2 production of 49.03 vol% (with LHV of 11.10 MJ/Nm3) was produced. This finding is thought to be a better source of energy which can be an appropriate fuel for Fischer Tropsch process for manufacturing of transportation fuels. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC"

This article presents a comprehensive review of various studies conducted in this domain with a particular emphasis on factors affecting the carbon dioxide uptake potential of various concrete types and the effect of carbonation on the critical properties of concretes. Studies conducted on the micro-mechanical analysis of carbon sequestered concrete show that carbonation significantly improved the microhardness of the concrete samples, thereby increasing the strength and reducing the cement intake requirement. Further, keeping two parameters, namely water/solid (w/s) ratio and carbonation reaction time, in focus, the carbon dioxide uptake capacity in concrete slurry waste (CSW) was evaluated using non-linear regression analysis. It was observed that CSW paste had a maximum carbon dioxide uptake with an intermediate w/s ratio of 0.2 due to carbon dioxide reaction hindrances during diffusion at a higher w/s ratio and lack of hydration at a lower w/s ratio. On the contrary, for belite-rich cement, a higher w/s ratio led to higher carbon dioxide uptake owing to belite phase consumption leading to increased calcite production. Additionally, comparing the maximum carbon dioxide uptake capacity of CSW at a particular condition with various other cement-based materials, it was observed that belite-rich cement had the ability to sequester the maximum amount of carbon dioxide compared to the other cement-based materials considered in this study. © 2023 ICE Publishing.

However, due to the dispersion limitation, the application of GO in practical engineering has not been widely accepted. Hence, we evaluated the potential of the GO-fly ash hybrid as additives in cement under a coating method to assist the dispersion of the GO nanosheets. The results demonstrated that the GO could be successfully coated on the surface of the fly ash particles with good dispersion and strong connection via the proposed coating method. Besides, the coating method allowed more GO nanosheets to concentrate in the interfacial transition zone (ITZ) between fly ash and cement particles, making GO application more economical. The coated GO could then generate nucleation effects to promote the hydration process and provide pore-infilling effects to decrease the ITZ width (about 12.5%) and the crack ratio in ITZ (over 10%). Compared with the plain cement pastes, the workability, mechanical strength, and impermeability of the GO-coated fly ash modified cementitious slurry can be significantly reinforced up to 21.6%, 38.4% and 106.4%, respectively. The enhancement rate is further improved by about 7.1–58.5% compared with the traditional ultrasonic dispersion method. We expect the proposed innovative coating method would provide a good perspective of the future application of high-performance, cost-effective and environmentally friendly cementitious composites. © 2023 The Author(s)"

Drawing on the Responsible Innovation in Health framework, this qualitative study asks: (1) what are the practice-oriented tools available for innovators to develop environmentally sustainable digital solutions and (2) how are organisation leaders supposed to support them in this endeavour? Methods Focusing on a subset of 34 tools identified through a comprehensive scoping review (health sciences, computer sciences, engineering and social sciences), our qualitative thematic analysis identifies and illustrates how two responsibility principles - environmental sustainability and organisational responsibility - are meant to be put in practice. Results Guidance to make environmentally sustainable digital solutions is found in 11 tools whereas organisational responsibility is described in 33 tools. The former tools focus on reducing energy and materials consumption as well as pollution and waste production. The latter tools highlight executive roles for data risk management, data ethics and AI ethics. Only four tools translate environmental sustainability issues into tangible organisational responsibilities. Conclusions Recognising that key design and development decisions in the digital health industry are largely shaped by market considerations, this study indicates that significant work lies ahead for medical and organisation leaders to support the development of solutions fit for climate change. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.

Concrete, the most commonly used material in construction, is known to release a substantial amount of environmentally harmful waste throughout its life cycle, including production, construction, operation, and demolition. The worldwide production and consumption of concrete contribute to approximately 5% of all human-related CO2 emissions each year. To assess the carbon footprint of concrete manufacturing and its application in construction projects, a comprehensive approach called life cycle assessment (LCA) is necessary. This paper presents a new process-based LCA approach to analyze carbon emissions and evaluate the carbon footprint of concrete from raw material extraction to the end-of-life stage. To address carbon emissions throughout the life cycle of concrete structures in the Middle East, the study adopts a case study approach, focusing on selected concrete structures in Jordan. The findings from these case studies highlight that the operational phase of concrete structures is the primary contributor to carbon emissions. By thoroughly examining the carbon cycle within structures and their interactions with the surrounding ecosystem, significant reductions in CO2 emissions, environmental deterioration, and its consequences can be achieved. © 2023 by the authors."

The uncontrolled disposal of surgical masks in the environment will pose serious threat to the living organisms due to plastic pollution. On the other hand, the construction industry is hugely dependent on natural resources, leading to increase in carbon footprint. Therefore, it necessary to investigate novel construction materials with sustainability perspective. In present study, alkali-activated bricks were synthesized with rice husk ash (RHA), ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS), sand, and sodium silicate (SS). To this, processed surgical masks (PSM) were added in varying doses of 0%, 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4% by volume of the mix. The results revealed that addition of PSM significantly improved the strength properties of the bricks with a maximum compressive strength of 6.85 MPa at inclusion of 4% PSM. At the same time, it has reduced the density of bricks with a minimum value of 1.54 g/cm3 at inclusion of 4% PSM. The incorporation of PSM has slightly increased the water absorption and porosity of the bricks, with a maximum increase of 4.76% and 7.75% for bricks with 4% PSM, when compared to bricks with 0% PSM, respectively. The accelerated ageing test showed that after three cycles of wetting and drying the bricks exhibited loss in compressive strength in the range of 55.2%–58.6%. The microstructure results revealed the bridging effect of fibrous mask particles in improving the load transfer in polymer matrix, and thereby reducing the brittle tensile failure in bricks. The pushover analysis showed the benefit of PSM in improving the performance of the infill walls due to improvement in brick strength and reduction in its self-weight, and therefore, it can be considered as a potential material for use in construction of buildings in seismically vulnerable areas. © 2023 The Author(s)"
1168,Does Globalization Cause Environmental Degradation in Developing Economies? Evidence from Cote d’Ivoire Using Ecological Footprint,Article,Keho Y.,International Journal of Energy Economics and Policy,13.0,2023,455,466,10.32479/ijeep.14325,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164830646&doi=10.32479%2fijeep.14325&partnerID=40&md5=94ae5e93ddc8cfdf9f702d1a58fae388,21464553,Scopus,Cote D’ivoire; Ecological Footprint; Environmental Degradation; Globalization,"This research examines the effects of globalization on environmental degradation in Cote d’Ivoire using data from 1970 to 2018. Previous studies in this area mostly focused on carbon emissions as indicator for environmental degradation. However, this study uses ecological footprint to cover different aspects of environmental degradation. Using the autoregressive distributed lag approach, the results disclose that globalization worsens the environmental quality by increasing ecological footprint. Furthermore, the results demonstrate a positive and monotonic relationship between economic growth and ecological footprint. The decomposition of globalization into different dimensions reveals that economic, social and political globalization contribute to environmental degradation. On the basis of the findings, some recommendations are suggested to tackle environmental degradation. © 2023, Econjournals. All rights reserved."

To meet this challenge, one of the alternatives is to replace carbon intensive processes with low-carbon processes involving electrical and/or renewable energies. Within this scope, a novel scheduling approach is proposed to take into account the introduction of onsite renewable energy. In particular, a lot sizing and production-scheduling problem in flexible flow line with renewable energy integration is formulated as a versatile optimization model. With regard to associated complexity issues, a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach is advocated to solve the lot sizing and scheduling problem. Finally, the approach is evaluated with a benchmark case and other numerical experiments. Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Due to its low level of energy consumption and portability, PMD is becoming increasingly attractive for water production in off-grid areas. However, it still suffers from several challenges, including membrane scaling. To address this issue, we developed photothermal membranes with different wettabilities. #PCNT-2 with a hydrophobic surface was obtained by electrospinning a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofibrous substrate and a hydrophobic PVDF/carbon nanotube (CNT) surface layer. The surface was then modified by depositing a polydopamine (PDA) layer to make it hydrophilic (#PCNT-D). It was found that #PCNT-D exhibited the highest surface temperature under both dry and wet conditions and the highest evaporation rate due to its broad light absorption and high photothermal efficiency. PMD tests show that #PCNT-D with a hydrophilic surface possessed the best antiscaling performance under illumination. This can be attributed to it having the highest surface temperature and lowest mass transfer resistance, the highest salt solubility on a membrane surface, and the best heat transfer efficiency between the heated membrane surface and absorbed water in the PDA layer. © 2022 American Chemical Society."

Both direct and indirect greenhouse gas emission sources of a supermarket retailing value chain were identified and calculated using the national guidelines for estimating the carbon footprint for organizations, based on a total area of 13 248 m2 and operating 12 h per day. A scoring matrix was applied that considered the magnitude of emissions, the level of influence, and the risks or opportunities associated with business operations. The scoring results indicated a major contribution from value chain activities that should be included in any greenhouse gas analysis. The calculation revealed that the greenhouse gas emissions from the value chain activities were 33 784 t CO2 emitted yr-1 or 94% of total emissions. The key contributors were linked to the production of purchased goods and the management of food waste. Thus, value chain activities should not be overlooked in developing efficient greenhouse gas management strategies. Furthermore, purchased products and services carrying a carbon-reduction label should be given priority, and the application of artificial intelligence and innovation could be considered to reduce the amount of food waste from expired goods. © 2023 American Meteorological Society."

However, the most recent interventions for reducing FW have still been focusing on slogans only, and the invisibility of the food-saving effect for new interventions such as small serving portions or intelligent catering systems, might weaken its application for investors. In this study, we used visual inspection, ecological footprints, and questionnaire survey to evaluate the food-saving potential by 1143 observations and 326 questionnaires at a university in Beijing, China. The results showed that using the new intervention of smaller serving portions coupled with an intelligent catering system, FW at canteens could decrease by 32.4% per year, that means it may reduce the original FW of 6.7 kt per year in Beijing, China. Correspondingly, this amount of reduced FW could equally reduce 24.7 kt of CO2-eq, 1.6 kt of nitrogen loss, 10.4 Mt of water wasted, and 2815.6 hm2 of land use. This study provided a promising alternative for soft persuasion, confirmed the potential of reducing FW and related eco-environmental loads, and increased the visibility of a new food-saving system for investors.  © 2023, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers."

Biodiesel is a renewable energy source that can be used to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It has emerged as a promising alternative to petroleum-based fuels due to its lower carbon footprint. However, it is important to note that the economic and energy output of vegetable oil plants that are involved in the production of this fuel is not known. Current research trends on biodiesel fuels have been investigated on non-edible oils, which present better performance when blended with diesel. This work studies the performance of karanja-based biodiesel on VCR engines with different Diesel Blending Ratio (DBR) of 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%. Engine performance and exhaust gas analysis tests are carried out on a VCR-diesel engine at various loads to examine specific characteristics of karanja biodiesel as a fuel. As per observations, DBR 10%, 20% of biodiesel exhibited better performance than the other blended fuels. To enhance the performance of DBR 10% and 20% biodiesel were graded up with the addition of 5% Methanol. The overall performance of all blended fuels is compared in all aspects. © 2023.

Iron ore mining is a protagonist of the Brazilian economy; however, the activity is associated with high CO2 emissions and Solid Waste (SW) generation, which represent major challenges for the sector. In this context, the aim of this study was to evaluate and discuss the SW management Carbon Footprint at ""Mina do Andrade"", an iron ore mining company located in the northeastern region of the Iron Quadrangle region (MG/BR), as an instrument for the development of low carbon policies. This assessment was carried out using the Composite Method of Current Accounts (MC3), which allows estimating the Corporate Carbon Footprint (CCF) of organizations based on documents provided by the company itself. The total emissions (net CCF) for SW management in the company were 346.58 tCO2 in 2017, 343.15 tCO2 in 2018 and 343.44 tCO2 in 2019. The total Industrial Solid Waste (ISW) CCF was zero throughout the period, as the forest areas contained within the boundaries of the company supplied the demand for carbon sequestration generated in the waste management. The reduction in ISW generation and the adoption of cleaner production strategies were the main drivers for the reduction of gross carbon emissions by the company in the three-year period under evaluation. The use of land for the disposal of waste rock in piles generated the highest SW CCF of the company in the entire evaluation period. So, this study is pioneer in the evaluation of the SW CCF of iron ore mining, and fills part of the existing gap due to the scarce number of peer-reviewed studies regarding the sector's Carbon Footprint. © 2023 WITPress.

Lean manufacturing aims to incorporate innovative tools into the manufacturing process to improve productivity and reduce processing time. In view of this, the model anticipates a flexible production rate based on labor, energy, and tool/die costs, to meet the demand while minimizing wastage. Moreover, a discrete investment in set-up costs is considered to lower the initial set-up cost since it is a critical component of smooth manufacturing operations. Further, it is found that price plays a significant role in stimulating a producta's demand; consequently, demand is presumed to be price-sensitive. Besides this, to reduce the carbon footprint in the production systems, two methods namely œ Carbon tax and œ Cap-and-trade , have been employed. The purpose of the developed model is to maximize total profit by jointly optimizing the production rate, selling price, and set-up cost. Numerical experiments are performed to validate the model findings. Results suggest that manufacturersa'production time decreases simultaneously with the introduction of advanced labor and technologies. With respect to carbon policies, the cap-and-trade policy performs better with an increase in total profit and a higher production rate as compared to a carbon tax. Also, sensitivity analysis is performed to support the manufacturer in the decision-making process for ancillary benefits of the optimal policy.  © 2023 Authors. All rights reserved."

Safe disposal and use of RAP in the cold in-place recycling (CIR) using foamed bitumen could be sustainable approach where milling and mixing operations are accomplished simultaneously. This will not only help in minimizing contamination (probability) and transportation cost but also reduces the carbon footprints. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the scope of RAP utilization up to 100% and further its effect on the behavior of reclaimed asphalt foamed bituminous mix. Design/methodology/approach: Reclaimed asphalt foamed bituminous mix (FBM) is still a new technique. The evidence of performance of 100% recycled pavement (CIR) is only anecdotal and lacks in systematic guidelines and literatures. Foam binder coating around the aggregates is also a concern. Therefore, this study is mainly emphasized to investigate the scope of RAP use in the FBM up to 100%. RAP content is varied in each trial, i.e. 70, 85, 100 and 0% (only fresh aggregates), to make the FBM. RAP use and its effect on the behavior of FBM in terms of resilient modulus, variation in resilient modulus with curing, rutting performance and the potential of resistance against the moisture damage are addressed. Findings: Considering the laboratory studies, it can be accomplished that mechanistic properties and performance of FBM are largely influenced by RAP material and portray less susceptible characteristics against the moisture damage. FBM containing 70% RAP content exhibits maximum resilient modulus. However, use of RAP up to 100% in FBM is satisfying the minimum required specification. Originality/value: Overall, the study may be helpful to highway professionals and could generate another possible option of 100% RAP replacing fresh aggregates in the flexible pavements. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."

As the industrial sectors expand rapidly in emerging countries, so does the need for waste management services. Sustainable alkali activated concrete (AAC) can be produced using the waste industrial by-products as a binder. These methods will reduce the carbon footprint of cement industries by solving the problem of industrial waste disposal. The feasibility of utilizing agricultural wastes such as rice husk ash (RHA) as a partial substitute from 0 to 40% for ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) was investigated using 10M and 12 M sodium hydroxide solution to produce AAC. The destructive tests, such as compressive, split tensile, flexural strength and non-destructive tests, such as ultrasonic pulse velocity, dynamic modulus of elasticity and rebound hammer tests, were carried out to evaluate the mechanical strength of AAC. A regression model was developed with the help of both artificial neural networks (ANN) and multiple regression analysis to predict the compressive strength from non-destructive tests. The model generated using an optimum ANN provided good results. The outcomes of this study indicate that the substitution of 10% RHA increases the strength of AAC and then decreases. The study included a comparative study with other earlier studies and the obtained results emphasized the need to use AAC based GGBS-RHA. © 2023, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."

In China, however, there is a lack of transboundary assessments that investigate the effects of energy consumption on water stress within and across river basins. In this study, we therefore investigate transboundary impacts on scarce water resources that are induced by energy demands (i.e., electricity, petroleum, coal mining, oil and gas extraction, and gas production). We develop a bottom-up high spatial resolution water inventory and link it to a 2017 multiregional input-output (MRIO) table of China to analyze supply chain scarce water use at provincial and river basin levels. We find that the energy-driven water footprint accounts for 21.6% of national water usage, of which 35.7% is scarce water. Nonelectric power energy sectors contribute to around half of the nation’s scarce water transfer. We identify three sets of catchments whose water resources are stressed by energy demand, i.e., (a) from the northern Hai River Basin to the eastern part of the Yellow River Basin and the Huai River Basin, (b) the northern area of the Northwest Rivers, and (c) the developed coastal city clusters in the Yangtze River Basin and the Pearl River Basin. We then evaluate the impacts of eight mitigation options, which may potentially shift around half of the moderate- or high-stress areas in the Hai River Basin and the Northwest Rivers to low to moderate (or even low) stress. We highlight the need for transboundary collaboration to sustain water-constrained energy demand and to develop targeted measures to mitigate stress on water resources within a river basin. © 2023 American Chemical Society"

However, the effects of GM on soil carbon sequestration (CS) and the carbon footprint (CF) at a regional scale remain unclear. Therefore, we combined the datasets from long-term multisite experiments with a meta-analysis approach to quantify the potential of GM to increase the CS and reduce the CF of paddy soils in southern China. Compared with the fallow–rice practice, the GM–rice practice increased the soil C stock at a rate of 1.62 Mg CO2-eq ha–1 yr–1 and reduced chemical N application by 40% with no loss in the rice yield. The total CF varied from 7.51 to 13.66 Mg CO2-eq ha–1 yr–1 and was dominated by CH4 emissions (60.7–81.3%). GM decreased the indirect CF by 31.4% but increased the direct CH4 emissions by 19.6%. In the low and high CH4 emission scenarios, the CH4 emission factors of GM (EFgc) were 5.58 and 21.31%, respectively. The greater soil CS offset the increase in GM-derived CF in the low CH4 scenario, but it could not offset the CF increase in the high CH4 scenario. A trade-off analysis also showed that GM can simultaneously increase the CS and reduce the total CF of the rice production system when the EFgc was less than 9.20%. The variation in EFgc was mainly regulated by the GM application rates and water management patterns. Determining the appropriate GM application rate and drainage pattern warrant further investigation to optimize the potential of the GM–rice system to increase the CS and reduce the total CF in China. © 2023 CAAS.

1182,FABRICATION OF PES@TiO2-GO MEMBRANE FOR DESALINATION PROCESS,Article,Sivanesan J.; Usha S.; Srinivasan G.; Shankar K.G.; Vikram R.,Rasayan Journal of Chemistry,16.0,2023,1646,1654,10.31788/RJC.2023.1638377,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85182485594&doi=10.31788%2fRJC.2023.1638377&partnerID=40&md5=a4da826b76e5bc1068a6b833f0da1704,09741496,Scopus,Blended Polymer Nanocomposite; Desalination; Membrane; Rejection Rate; Water Flux,"The membrane filtration process has been a rapidly emerging technology for removing different sizes of pollutants from untreated industrial wastewater owing to their desired merits relative to conventional treatment processes such as lower operating expenses, higher separation efficiency, smaller carbon footprint, and stable product quality. Presently, thin-film composite, blended ultrafiltration, and nanocomposite membranes provide excellent separation performance for pressure-driven water treatment techniques. In this perception, polyethersulfone (PES) based blended polymer nanocomposite (BPN) ultrafiltration membranes were fabricated for desalination applications. PES layers as support were fabricated with a blended mass of titanium dioxide (TiO2) particles and then graphene oxide (GO) particles in the nano range were combined to enhance the rejection rate and water flux of the membrane. Phase inversion and Modified Hummer's methods were adapted to prepare the layers of PES as support and graphene oxide. Blended polymer nanoparticle membrane-PES@TiO2(2%)-GO (0.5%) exhibited enhanced water flux (86.5 l m-2 h-1 bar-1 ), mean radius of the pore (15.9 nm), porosity (90.625%) and 86% salt rejection which proves that the membrane stands good for desalination. © 2023, Rasayan Journal of Chemistry, c/o Dr. Pratima Sharma.

1183,Awareness and Constraints towards the Implementation of Green Dentistry amongst Dental Students and Private Practitioners of West India,Article,Thakar S.; Kinariwala N.; Pandya D.; Parekh N.H.; Patel N.K.; Patel A.,Journal of Pharmacy and Bioallied Sciences,15.0,2023,S1287,S1290,10.4103/jpbs.jpbs_116_23,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85179756805&doi=10.4103%2fjpbs.jpbs_116_23&partnerID=40&md5=9c8ed5ce86b453a1d3b7d72964d1a484,09757406,Scopus,Awareness of green dentistry; eco-friendly dentistry; green dentistry; sustainable dentistry,"Background: Dentistry is a resource-intensive discipline of healthcare that has a notable impact on the environment. Sustainability should be the major consideration for healthcare service providers to support climate change policies. Green dentistry is an efficient strategy for practicing eco-friendly dentistry. This study was conducted to assess the awareness, knowledge, and barriers to practicing green dentistry among dental practitioners and dental students. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional, descriptive-analytical online questionnaire survey with 22 questions was carried out. Results: 51.8% of participants were not aware of the concept of green dentistry. Practitioners of the age group 20-30 years are more willing to transform their dental practice into green practice to reduce the carbon footprint of their clinic (P < 0.05). Chi-square data analysis shows that dental practitioners treating more than 20 patients in a week have a better awareness of the concept of green dentistry (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study, dental professionals in the younger age group are eager to transform their dental practices to green practices to lessen their clinics' carbon footprints. Financial constraints limit the implementation of green dentistry into clinical practice.  © 2023 Journal of Pharmacy and Bioallied Sciences."
1184,Estonian Energy Roadmap to carbon neutrality,Article,Volkova A.; Sukumaran S.; Kisel E.; Grünvald O.; Veske A.; Purga J.,International Journal of Sustainable Energy Planning and Management,38.0,2023,30,46,10.54337/ijsepm.7568,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85168784505&doi=10.54337%2fijsepm.7568&partnerID=40&md5=54cbfed7b46d9eee4e68363c04a89ed3,22462929,Scopus,Carbon footprint; Climate change; Energy modelling; Energy roadmaps,"The aim of this study is to demonstrante Estonian Energy Roadmap 2040 modelling process, taking into account energy consumption in accordance with the expectation and improvement of the living standard. In the frame of this study, the evaluation of the possibility for Estonian Energy sector to become carbon neutral by 2040 have been presented.

1185,How much environmental burden does the shifting to nutritional diet bring? Evidence of dietary transformation in rural China,Article,Han A.; Chai L.; Liu P.,Environmental Science and Policy,145.0,2023,129,138,10.1016/j.envsci.2023.04.001,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85153491944&doi=10.1016%2fj.envsci.2023.04.001&partnerID=40&md5=58dbff16826128bb4b615fe21f1d352b,14629011,Scopus,China; Environmental footprints; Nutritional diet; Rural diet,"There is a rapid increase in demand for higher quality and healthier diets in less developed regions such as rural areas. Given the large disparity in nutrition levels between urban and rural areas, such demands are justified and should be pursued. However, little attention has been paid to the environmental consequences of rural diet change and the solutions that follow. With its large scale of rural population and the rapid development of rural areas due to the implementation of Rural Revitalization National Strategy, China is taken as a typical example to explore the environmental impacts of rural dietary improvement. A framework for evaluating water footprints, carbon footprints, and ecological footprints is established, and four scenarios are presented based on increased rural income and a reduction in urban-rural imbalance. The findings revealed a significant improvement in diet quality with increasing income, decreasing urban-rural disparities, and compensating for insufficient food consumption (total deviation decreases from 69% to an average of 38%). However, such improvements would significantly increase the environmental burden, with water footprints ranging from 24% to 71%, carbon footprints ranging from 5% to 46%, and ecological footprints ranging from 20% to 122%. The primary reason is increased consumption of dairy products, meat, and aquatic products. As a result, when developing national dietary guidelines, environmental indicators should be considered alongside nutrition and health metrics. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

Industrial wastes, like steel slag and blastfurnace slag, usually have latent hydraulic reactivity, and can be used as precursors of AAC. Both clinkerless and clinker-free AAC were prepared from the mixture of steel slag and blastfurnace slag by using water glass as an activator, and four different recipes which satisfied the strength requirement of 42.5R Portland cement were obtained. Each recipe of AAC exhibited better resistance to sulfate attack and frost attack than Portland cement. AAC showed huge drying shrinkage, but it was equivalent to that of Portland cement as steel slag content increased to 40%. The AAC also had quite low risk of alkali-aggregate reaction. Microstructure analysis showed that the major products were calcium silicate hydrate (C–S–H), calcium aluminosilicate hydrate (C–A–S–H) and zeolite-like phases. Ettringite was also detected in the binder when gypsum was contained in the precursors. © 2023, China Iron and Steel Research Institute Group Co., Ltd."

The research was reviewed on the basis of literature data from the past few years, which shows that the researchers are increasingly paying attention to the possibility of synthesis of AAM from such waste materials as industrial slags and ashes, concrete and demolition waste, red brick waste and glass waste. This is driven by the need to find competitive solutions to the commonly used blast furnace slags and fly ashes in the cement industry, which are also a source for obtaining traditional AAM. Analysis of material solutions has shown that these materials are being successfully used to produce new AAMs, with most of them being only a partial replacement for slags and fly ash. The article also points out that silicon- and aluminum-rich waste materials such as red mud, rice husks, and waste glass can be successfully used to activate AAMs materials, in place of typical activators in the form of sodium silicates or hydroxides, which in turn contributes to lowering the carbon footprint of AAMs. However, the future of this type of solution depends on several factors, the most important of which seems to be the understanding of the polymerization mechanisms of the more complex aluminosilicate systems and the achievement of reproducible physical and chemical parameters of AAM, resulting in strong and durable binders and, ultimately, construction materials made from them. © 2023 The Author(s)"

Pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs) have raised concerns over their environmental impact due to GHG emissions. Evaluations and reduction strategies for GHGs have been primarily studied in Europe, but not in other regions, including Japan. Therefore, our objective was to calculate the carbon footprint of inhalers in Japan and evaluate their reduction scenarios. Methods: Using the National Database of Health Insurance Claims, our analysis was conducted on inhaler prescriptions in Japan for the fiscal year of 2019. We calculated the number of inhalers used, GHG emissions, and total costs. Next, we simulated the environmental and economic impacts of three reduction scenarios: the first scenario replaced pMDI with dry power inhalers, followed by age-based replacements. In the last scenario, we replaced pMDI with a propellant with a lower global warming potential. Results: All inhaler-related GHG emissions were 202 ktCO2e, of which 90.9% were attributed to pMDI use. Scenario analysis demonstrated that replacing 10% pMDI with DPI would reduce emissions by 6.7%, with a relatively modest increase in cost; substituting 10% of pMDI used by adults (excluding children and older adults) with alternative inhalers would reduce emissions by 6.1%, with a 0.7% increase in cost; and, replacing 10% of pMDI propellants with lower global warming potential would reduce emissions by 9.3%. Conclusions: Selecting appropriate inhalers can mitigate GHG emissions in Japan, but its impact will be less than in other countries. Nevertheless, collaborative efforts between physicians, patients, and pharmaceutical companies are necessary to reduce GHG emissions. © 2023 The Authors.

In the ecosphere, the environment is a predator of human consumption. The continent Asia holding more than 60% of the world’s population is vulnerable to environmental deployment. The purpose of the study is to find the link between economic growth, globalization, biocapacity, energy intensity, and renewable energy to the ecological footprint (EFP) in Asian countries for the period of 1990–2017. For empirics, the econometric techniques applied are panel OLS, fixed effects, random effects, fully modified-OLS, DOLS, and generalized methods of moments techniques. The results prove that by increasing the share of renewable energy in total energy consumption the environmental quality is improved. The Pedroni cointegration test shows a long-term relationship exists between globalization, economic growth, and the environment. The results of all techniques show the similar effectiveness of all used economic indicators in the model that disturbs the environment with different intensities in each test. The results of FM-OLS show that with a 1% increase in economic growth, globalization, biocapacity, and population density the ecological footprint increases by 0.55%, 0.08%, 0.06%, and 0.03%, respectively. However, renewable energy improves the environment by 0.04%. The Granger causality analysis revealed a bidirectional causality between ecological footprint and globalization and between EFP and energy intensity. This study recommends that Asian countries should make sustainable environmental policies to protect the environment from further damage. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

As one of the most energy-intensive and energy-consuming activities in the apparel consumption process, laundry and clothes drying have a significant impact on the environment in terms of carbon emissions and water consumption. Undergraduates are a special category of people whose worldviews are in the developmental stage, and it is important to study and develop their beliefs and behaviors regarding environmental consumption. This study investigates and evaluates the relationship between undergraduates’ consumption behaviors and environmental impacts. The 125 undergraduates in Hangzhou, China are classified into three different washing modes: H-mode (hand-washing only), M-mode (machine-washing only), and HM-mode (hand- and machine-washing) on the basis of their washing behavior. The environmental impacts including water footprint and carbon footprint of undergraduates are calculated by the methods of direct consumptive carbon footprint ((Formula presented.)) and direct consumptive water footprint ((Formula presented.)). The results show that the factors leading to the environmental impacts of Hangzhou undergraduates’ apparel consumption behavior are: washing frequency, consumer knowledge, washing method, drying frequency and method and clothing purchase quantity. It also reveals that higher washing and drying frequencies can lead to more energy and water consumption, which ultimately result in more severe environmental impact. Besides, consumer knowledge, washing and drying method do have a significant influence on undergraduates’ (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.). Understanding the factors that influence undergraduates’ apparel consumption behavior can help cultivate their environmental awareness as well as provide guidance to the government and universities in identifying the environmental impact of undergraduates’ clothing consumption. © The Author(s) 2023."
1191,Electricity accounting in life cycle assessment: the challenge of double counting,Article,Holzapfel P.; Bach V.; Finkbeiner M.,International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment,28.0,2023,771,787,10.1007/s11367-023-02158-w,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85153039104&doi=10.1007%2fs11367-023-02158-w&partnerID=40&md5=c6329175d13e01f4156a8684128ceb7b,09483349,Scopus,Double counting; Energy attribute certificates; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Renewable energy,"Purpose: In grid electricity consumption models, the location-based method uses regional average emission factors to account for environmental impacts. The market-based method is based on contractual agreements, verifying the exclusive claim on electricity from specific energy sources. An inconsistent application of these methods in life cycle assessment (LCA) and GHG accounting can lead to double counting. Especially, double counting electricity associated with rather low environmental impacts, such as renewable energy, might lead to impact underestimations. The aim of this paper is to identify, describe and propose solutions to double counting challenges. Methods: A four-step procedure is carried out. First, the specifications on grid electricity mix selection in frequently applied standards for LCA and GHG accounting are analysed. Besides the ISO norms for LCA (14040/44) and carbon footprinting (14064/67), the GHG Protocol and the Product and Organizational Environmental Footprint (PEF/OEF) are considered. Based on this analysis, challenges of double counting electricity from specific sources are identified. In the third step, potential solutions for avoiding double counting are proposed. The last research step consists of an illustrative case study to demonstrate the calculation of market-based electricity mixes and identify potential adjustments necessities for LCA application. Results and discussion: A parallel application of the location-based and the market-based method poses the main double-counting challenge. Thus, avoiding double counting demands consistent method application throughout the whole life cycle. Whereas this is relatively straightforward for the location-based method, consistent market-based method application is more challenging. LCAs rely on average life cycle inventory processes, which mostly include location-based electricity mixes. However, for consistent market-based method application throughout the life cycle, electricity-related environmental impacts in the inventory system also need to be market-based. This would demand a partial recalculation of LCI datasets using market-based residual electricity mixes. Besides illustrating the calculation of market-based electricity mixes, the case study is used to identify and propose solutions for two main challenges for residual mix application in LCA: countries without residual mix and electricity under a double marketing ban. Conclusion: Double counting of electricity from specific energy sources is a challenge, since it can lead to under- or overestimations of environmental impacts. Both the location-based and market-based method can avoid double counting. However, parallel or inconsistent applications of both methods lead to double counting. In order to avoid double counting, there is a need to enable and use consistent electricity accounting rules in LCA and GHG accounting. © 2023, The Author(s)."

Despite many efforts, the exact geopolymerization mechanism remains a topic of investigation. In the present work, we determined the dimerization processes between Si/Al-bearing monomers through metadynamics. The free energy profiles were obtained using ab initio constrained molecular dynamics simulations. The results reveal that metastable pentacoordinate states formed after exposure to the alkaline medium, followed by the release of the hydroxyl on the rotational axis. The presence of Al(OH)4− monomers would significantly reduce the reaction barriers of dimerization, implying that Al(OH)4− monomers promote the crosslinking degree of the geopolymer gel. Increasing the pH value of the alkali-activated solution would facilitate the reaction between Si-bearing monomers and Al(OH)4− monomers. However, the reaction between anionic Si-bearing monomers presents a much higher barrier because of intensive electrostatic repulsion. Therefore, increasing the pH value decreases the Si/Al ratio of the geopolymer gel at the initial stage, which is consistent with the experimental results. This study refines the understanding of the oligomerization process of aluminosilicates by ab initio molecular simulations. © 2023 The American Ceramic Society."

The study primarily focuses on the less carbon emission and the economical range of operation for various equivalence ratios. The critical equivalence ratio (Φ) is predicted to be 0.62, below which the combustion does not initiate. The maximum CO emission in combustion is found at Φ = 2.32, and the maximum specific impulse (Isp) is obtained 327.92 at Φ = 1.50. However, for clean burning of the fuel and less carbon footprint, lean mixture combustion is desirable. The CO emission for Φ = 1.50 is 41%, which is considerably a higher carbon emission percentage for this combustion process. On the other hand, the lean mixture at Φ = 0.80 has a CO emission of 14.7% at the nozzle outlet which is relatively small. The developed power is 57.73 MW with an Isp of 310.96 at Φ = 0.80 which is close to the Isp obtained for Φ = 1.50. Thus, for eco-friendly clean burring, combustion of LOx-BioLPG fuel for Φ = 0.80 is found to be the best in this analysis. © 2023 The Author(s)"

Some people view these metaphors as obfuscating or ineffective, while others believe they are crucial for improving climate communications and environmental attitudes. In this paper, we provide a systematic overview and evaluation of the use of English metaphors in Anglo environmental discourse, drawing on a range of empirical and popular media sources. We begin by discussing the role of metaphor in language in thought. Next, we introduce a range of metaphors used to frame discussions of (1) our relationship to nature (e.g., the earth is our common home), (2) our impact on the environment (e.g., we are knocking the climate off balance), and (3) how we should address this impact (e.g., reduce our ecological footprint). We classify these metaphors along several dimensions, including how conventional they are, how systemic they are, how emotionally impactful they are, and how aptly they capture the topics they are used to describe. From this analysis, we derive several promising candidate metaphors that may help increase public understanding and engagement with environmental issues. However, we note that such claims must be tested empirically in future research; currently, there are few large, systematic, replicable experiments in the literature assessing the impact of environmental metaphors. We conclude by offering general recommendations for using metaphors in communications about climate change and sustainability. © 2023 Cognitive Science Society LLC."

The ability of a company to offset its emissions successfully depends on the availability and quality of guidance on the subject. This study explores how well existing offsetting guidelines equip corporations to achieve successful emissions offsetting. Methods: Instructional criteria were developed and used to evaluate seven guidelines. The contents of each guideline were assessed based on how they instruct a company to achieve emissions offsetting that fulfills five criteria for appropriate offsetting: target affiliation, Paris compatibility, effectiveness, prioritizing removals, and transparency. Results and discussion: The review revealed that necessary instructions enabling appropriate emissions offsetting were absent in the guidelines. Moreover, the degree of climate ambition and the role of offsetting varied between guidelines. Deficiencies in emissions offsetting guidance may increase the uncertainty of companies’ succeeding in offsetting their emissions. Conclusions: Developing guidance on emissions offsetting could benefit society and corporations by increasing the certainty of achieving successful emissions offsetting. Standardizing corporate emissions offsetting could be considered as one solution for unifying the practice.

Replacing Portland cement with supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) could reduce the environmental impact. This paper examines the carbon footprint of reinforced concrete columns. It focuses on the influence of increasing the steel cross-section and reducing the clinker factor by replacing Portland cement with SCM. Methods: Eighteen concrete mixtures were selected and classified according to the specified compressive strength at 28 days of curing using binary and ternary blended cements. Columns were designed consisting of such concretes and employing different reinforcing steel cross-sections. The life cycle assessment was conducted on ISO 14040 standard. The embodied carbon dioxide (ECO2) of the reinforced concrete columns was determined. Results: The results show that the higher the compressive strength of concrete, the lower the carbon footprint of the columns. Concretes with a high volume of SCM replacement and low compressive strength at 28 days do not show the lowest carbon footprint since it requires a greater volume of material to withstand the bearing capacity. The carbon footprint of the columns increases as the steel section increases. Furthermore, increasing the compressive strength of concrete is less beneficial for reducing the carbon footprint of the column when the steel cross-section is increased. Conclusions: Portland cement is the component material of concrete that contributes the most to the concrete carbon footprint, and steel has the highest ECO2/tonne. Replacing Portland cement with SCM reduces ECO2 at one point of the life cycle and may increase the material volume and ECO2 at another. The lowest carbon footprint of compressed reinforced concrete elements is achieved for the higher-strength concretes and the minimum steel cross-section. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
1197,Low-carbon footprint approach to produce recycled compacted concrete,Article,Mostazid M.I.; Sakai Y.,Ceramics International,49.0,2023,22219,22231,10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.04.052,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152587859&doi=10.1016%2fj.ceramint.2023.04.052&partnerID=40&md5=63865a493f446637feb76808034ceba7,02728842,Scopus,Autoclaving; Carbon footprint; Compressive strength; Concrete debris; Heat treatment; Production pressure,"Achieving a closed-loop recycling process with low CO2 emissions remains a challenge for the concrete industry. To improve the recycling of concrete debris, a powder compaction process for concrete waste was designed to obtain recycled compacted concrete (hereinafter referred to as compact) and thermal treatment was proposed to be utilized to improve its strength. However, non-specific investigations of treatment parameters, like-treatment temperature, and duration, do still exist, and the required high production pressure (100 MPa) is impracticable. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of two novel treatments on compact in improving its strength and reducing its carbon footprint. First, the heat treatment process used in a previous study [1] was expanded by varying immersion durations and treatment temperatures. Second, autoclaving was employed to obtain a stronger compact with different treatment settings. Additionally, in both treatment processes, the efficacy of low production pressure (<100 MPa) was evaluated. For this, eighteen different concrete wastes, having different industrial wastes, like-fly ash, slag, were collected, crushed, and powdered to produce compacts. The treated compacts were characterized based on both compressive strength and carbon footprint to compare the environmental performance of a compact prepared via thermal treatments in the production phase. The test results revealed that increasing water immersion duration (to 48 h) during the heat treatment process improved the compact strength to up to 48 MPa, and autoclaving at higher temperatures (at 220 °C) resulted in a compact strength of up to 98 MPa. Additionally, a strength of 30 MPa was attained even at a low production pressure (10 MPa) after autoclaving. The estimated CO2 emissions of the compact production process developed in this study were as low as 70.6 kg/m3 of compact. At the present stage of the study, it can be deduced that the compact manufactured possesses potential for implementation in various non-structural applications, including the production of pavement blocks and bricks, with lower CO2 emissions. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l."

In this study, the life cycle assessment (LCA) of the existing concrete gravity Pine Flat dam in the stages of construction to destruction, disposal, and recycling is investigated through ReCiPe 2016 methodology and the effect of two approaches of seismic retrofitting and non-retrofitting in the life cycle of the dam is studied. For a comprehensive understanding of the sustainability of the dam's life cycle, carbon footprint analysis (CFA) and life cycle costing (LCC) are also conducted to identify the main sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and evaluate the economic performance. These demands begin by assessing the dam's life cycle across three distinct stages, namely, initial construction, seismic retrofitting, and decommissioning, assuming recycling 20% of demolished concrete for the last stage. The outcomes of the evaluation are then presented for four different life cycle scenarios. The findings have underscored the importance of reducing air pollution and emphasize that human health is the most significant environmental concern as compared to the ecosystem and resource indicators. The concrete recycling considered during the decommissioning stage led to a 32% reduction in pollution caused by the dam disposal process. Additionally, the effect of retrofitting dams in decreasing environmental impact indicators such as carbon footprint and human health has been considered when compared to dam disposal. The economic and environmental costs of retrofitting Pine Flat dam were obtained about half of the equivalent expenses for its disposal and recycling stage. © 2023 Institution of Structural Engineers"

Thus, it can be assumed that India is committed to improving its atmospheric health over the next couple of decades. Thus, strategizing plans for limiting carbon emission-related environmental pollution has gone on to become a critically important objective of the Indian government. Against this backdrop, this current study aims to examine the factors influencing atmospheric quality in India. As opposed to the previously adopted approaches in the existing studies, a composite atmospheric quality index is estimated using data concerning different carbon dioxide emission-related atmospheric quality indicators (total carbon dioxide emissions, carbon footprints, and carbon intensity levels). Furthermore, the analysis of the possible non-linear association between renewable energy use and atmospheric pollution makes an additional contribution to the environmental literature. Using quarterly frequency data from 1990q1 to 2018q4 and employing advanced econometric techniques suitable for handling structural break issues, the empirical results reveal that globalization through economic and social channels, agricultural output expansion, and greater population density trigger atmospheric pollution in the long run. Besides, the relationship between renewable energy consumption and atmospheric quality is found to exhibit an inverted U-shape. In this regard, the threshold share of renewable energy in the total final energy consumption level of India is predicted at around 45.75% which is comparatively higher than India's current renewable energy consumption share. Furthermore, urbanization is evidenced to stimulate the deterioration of India's atmospheric quality, both in the short- and long-run. In line with these major findings, some policy-oriented recommendations are made. © 2023 International Association for Gondwana Research"
1200,Carbon footprint of a news broadcasting organisation,Article,Fouladvand J.; Oudendijk R.; Hooimeijer M.; Derks R.; Berndsen S.,Sustainable Production and Consumption,39.0,2023,257,268,10.1016/j.spc.2023.05.004,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85160003579&doi=10.1016%2fj.spc.2023.05.004&partnerID=40&md5=c074f7fb8f1621a23d4c9e3308c170d9,23525509,Scopus,Broadcast media industry; CO<sub>2</sub> emission; Emission reduction; Environmental assessment; Greenhouse gas emissions; Sustainable organisation,"Carbon footprint analysis has been used as a well-known indicator to study the carbon dioxide emissions of organisations and productions. Although various studies and approaches are developed, none focus on news broadcasting organisations. Therefore, the carbon footprint of such organisations and carbon emission reduction strategies are not well understood. This lack of knowledge potentially undermines such organisations' sustainability and blocks their contribution to the higher level sustainability goals. To address this gap, for the first time, this study aims to explore and quantify the carbon footprint of news broadcasting organisations. The current study took Nieuwsuur, a Dutch news broadcasting organisation, as a case study. The results demonstrated that the news broadcasting organisation emits 235.28 t of CO2eq yearly. The study categorised the CO2 emissions into five main categories, namely: (i) travel and transport, (ii) office and studio, (iii) accommodation, (iv) materials, and (v) waste, which for each of them sub-categories have been defined and studied. Travel and transport contributed the most to the carbon footprint of such organisations. Within this category, air travel has the most significant share (27 % of total emissions), which cannot be mitigated due to the nature of news broadcasting organisations. In contrast, commuter travel and outsourced travel (together with 37.6 % of total emissions) have considerable potential for reducing carbon emissions. The following categories are office and studio, with 20.7 % of total emissions and materials, with 4.9 % of total emissions. The study recommended that working from home and outsourcing from sustainable companies are the easiest and most effective carbon reduction strategies. Other emissions reduction strategies are discussed for each category, and recommendations are provided. © 2023 The Authors"

Telemedicine has the potential to decrease health care’s carbon footprint by reducing patient travel and clinic-related emissions. At our institution, telemedicine visits for evaluation of benign foregut disease were implemented for patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to estimate the environmental impact of telemedicine usage for these clinic encounters. Methods: We used life cycle assessment (LCA) to compare greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for an in-person and a telemedicine visit. For in-person visits, travel distances to clinic were retrospectively assessed from 2020 visits as a representative sample, and prospective data were gathered on materials and processes related to in-person clinic visits. Prospective data on the length of telemedicine encounters were collected and environmental impact was calculated for equipment and internet usage. Upper and lower bounds scenarios for emissions were generated for each type of visit. Results: For in-person visits, 145 patient travel distances were recorded with a median [IQR] distance travel distance of 29.5 [13.7, 85.1] miles resulting in 38.22–39.61 carbon dioxide equivalents (kgCO2-eq) emitted. For telemedicine visits, the mean (SD) visit time was 40.6 (17.1) min. Telemedicine GHG emissions ranged from 2.26 to 2.99 kgCO2-eq depending on the device used. An in-person visit resulted in 25 times more GHG emissions compared to a telemedicine visit (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Telemedicine has the potential to decrease health care’s carbon footprint. Policy changes to facilitate telemedicine use are needed, as well as increased awareness of potential disparities of and barriers to telemedicine use. Moving toward telemedicine preoperative evaluations in appropriate surgical populations is a purposeful step toward actively addressing our role in health care’s large carbon footprint. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

However, the heat required for the reaction is obtained by combustion of fossil fuels, so CO2 footprint of the process is significant. Another problematic aspect of the process concerns the heat transfer to the catalytic volume: for allowing the catalytic bed to reach and maintain the reaction temperature, the heating medium outside the tubes containing the catalyst must have a temperature higher than 1000 °C. A process intensification could be performed by combining two innovative technologies: (i) the use of electrification for the energy supply (microwave heating and direct electrification) and (ii) the adoption of structured catalysts with high thermal conductivity. This work proposed the study of electrified DRM process using two Ni-based structured catalysts prepared starting by different carriers, a Silicon carbide (SiC) honeycomb monolith and a Si–SiC open-cell foam. The electrification of the DRM process has been realized by using either microwave heating or electrification through Joule (or ohmic) heating, and the experimental tests have been performed at different space velocity values. The configuration of the carriers has been carefully chosen in order to enhance the heat and mass transport phenomena, allowing to assure a flat temperature profile along the entire catalytic bed. The results have shown that the SiC monolith is more suitable than the Si–SiC foam for a microwave-assisted catalytic test. In fact, the higher fraction of void in the foam determines a lower heat absorption, and a consequently higher energy consumption (8.29 kWh/Nm3 H2 and 4.2 kWh/Nm3 H2, for the foam and the monolith respectively). Moreover, the monolith-based catalyst approached the thermodynamic equilibrium values in terms of CH4 conversion in all the investigated temperature range, while in the same tests the foam-based catalyst reached these values only at the higher temperatures. Conversely, the foam-based catalyst has shown the best performance in the electrification tests through Joule heating: the CH4 conversion approached the equilibrium values in the investigated temperature range and, more important, the energy consumption value was of 2.6 kWh/Nm3 H2, very close to the theoretical one (1.90 kWh/Nm3 H2) and equal to about ¼ of that obtained with microwaves. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

In this study, real-time data from a specialty papermaking enterprise were collected to analyze the life-cycle carbon footprint of fine-grained grammage paper products, and pathways for economic carbon mitigation in papermaking enterprises were proposed. The results showed that the carbon footprint of the products ranged from 0.95 to 1.83 tCO2e/t paper. Low-grammage products have a high life-cycle carbon footprint and manufacturing emissions owing to their high raw materials and energy consumption. Conversely, high-grammage products have a low lifecycle carbon footprint but high manufacturing emissions owing to their low energy consumption and high raw material consumption. Various scenarios have shown that purchasing green electricity and implementing rooftop photovoltaics are the most cost-effective measures for enterprises to substantially reduce their carbon footprint. In addition, using information technology and intelligence to optimize and control papermaking systems can provide a more efficient and economical approach for mitigating carbon emissions without relying on external changes in energy structures. This study offers valuable insights for papermaking enterprises to reduce their carbon footprint and adhere to China's carbon emission regulations. © 2023"

While originally developed through a nutritional lens, food security is also increasingly incorporating the environmental quality of diets. This study develops a Structural Equation Model to examine how consumers concerns over food insecurity – in terms of its impact on health and poverty – and environmental beliefs influence the carbon footprint of diets. Using data from a survey representative of the Italian population, this study shows that health-related food insecurity concerns increase the use of health motives when shopping for food, in turn reducing the carbon footprint of the diet. Conversely, poverty-related food insecurity concerns are associated to diets higher in carbon footprint, as they reduce health motives, and increase private shopping motives (e.g., taste, low price). Overall, the study highlights how shifts to more sustainable food systems require a better understanding of what motivate consumers to make more sustainable food choices. © 2023 The Authors"

The direct impact of climate change on healthcare has been associated with extreme weather events, resulting in a higher demand for disaster management resources and reduced healthcare access. Moreover, the increase of zoonotic spillover effects has increased the risk of transmission of different diseases, including COVID-19. The healthcare industry alone is responsible for 4.4% of greenhouse gas global emissions. The surgical theatre is a resource-intense healthcare activity and a major carbon emitter, thus surgical processes require rethinking. This article proposes the introduction of environmental-related outcome measures in clinical trials, which will associate highest clinical standards to a reduced impact of care on climate change. Breast cancer care may represent a model disease for the implementation of evidence-based protocols, such as Green Breast Surgery, aiming to optimize the carbon footprint of care without affecting oncological and non-oncological outcomes.

A number of measures need to be taken to reduce the effects of waste materials such as rice husks, glass, plastic, and other types of materials on the environment. A significant reduction in environmental pollution can be achieved by utilizing these waste materials in construction. The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of rice husk ash (RHA) as a pozzolanic material to partially replace cement in a previously optimized mixture of recycled-glass-based Ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC). Furthermore, this study included commercial mineral admixtures such as silica fume and limestone powder along with these components. Based on the results of the study, it can be concluded that the use of RHA in the optimized recycled glass UHPC renders the concrete much less workable and also leads to a marginal decrease in its compressive strength (by about 7%). Additionally, the study demonstrates a significant interaction between RHA and water content, attributed to the water-absorbing capacity of RHA particles, which also provides an internal curing effect. Ultimately, incorporating RHA as a partial replacement for cement in the optimized recycled-glass-based UHPC enables a substantial decrease in the concrete's carbon footprint, without causing significant harm to its performance, thereby promoting an environmentally friendly approach to concrete production. © 2023 The Author(s)"

This study aimed to estimate the land footprint (LF) associated with FL worldwide. It also estimated the GHG emissions from crop residues and their burning, and their relationship with food loss for the main crops worldwide. The study analyzed data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) regarding land use, FL, and global GHG emissions from crop residues. RESULTS: The findings suggest that the average LF associated with FL worldwide is about 69 million ha per year, and the main food items responsible for most of the LF associated with FL are maize, wheat, and rice. The annual average emissions derived from burning crop residues of FL are 48.8 kilotons year−1 of CH4 and 1.26 kilotons year−1 of N2O, and the emission of N2O derived from crop residues of FL is about 24.1 kilotons year−1, considering the three crops. CONCLUSION: Food loss implies high levels of LF and GHG emissions, reinforcing the need for proper public and private initiatives worldwide to reduce FL and waste (FLW). Organizations such as the FAO and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) should incorporate indicators regarding FLW reduction to evaluate and monitor countries’ performance. An international agreement also needs to be addressed to engage the world's nations in the reduction of FLW levels. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry."

China is one of the largest manufacturers and traders of OSB in the world. However, little data are available concerning the GHG footprint of Chinese OSB production. The purpose of this study is to quantify and compare the GHG footprints of three types of OSB produced in China. Cradle-to-gate GHG footprints assessment models were built for OSB according to PAS 2050 guidelines. The results showed that the cradle-to-gate GHG footprints of OSB/2, OSB/3, and OSB/4 were 142.7 kg CO2 e/m3, 173.2 kg CO2 e/m3, and 374.2 kg CO2 e/m3, respectively. Raw material acquisition was the largest contributor to GHG footprint for three types of OSB (52.6~57.6%), followed by the production process of OSB (25.6~27.3%) and transportation (15.3~20.1%). The consumption of wood, MDI, electricity, and the transportation of wood were main emission hotspots in Chinese OSB production. Ultimately, four feasible GHG emission reduction measures were put forward from the perspective of reducing the usage of wood and MDI adhesive, decreasing the electricity consumption, and shortening the transport distance of wood. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

After an initial description of the manufacturing process of the new material, its carbon footprint and embodied energy have been calculated by means of the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology according to the ISO 14044 and the ISO 14067 guidelines adapted to the analyzed context. In particular, the inventory analysis is based on data collected from the production of samples of the new material at the laboratory scale. Results and discussion: The results of the LCA indicate that, when the biogenic carbon fixed in the UA wastes is considered, a negative carbon footprint of − 0.2 kg CO2 eq. per kg of material can be obtained. Hence, it can be assumed that from a life cycle perspective the material is able to fix carbon emissions instead of emitting them. Specifically, for the considered scenario, approximately 0.42 kg CO2 eq./m2 per year could be sequestered. However, the crop area required to produce enough waste to manufacture a unit of material is quite high. Therefore, future studies should focus on individuate solutions to reduce the density of the new component, and also different urban crops with higher waste production rates. Conclusions: The outcomes of the study put in evidence the potential of the new proposed infill wall component in fixing carbon emissions from UA, allowing to also compensate those relating to the production and transportation stages of the component life cycle. Moreover, producing by-products with UA wastes, hence temporally storing the carbon fixed by crops, may contribute to reduce the carbon cycles speed conversely to traditional waste management solutions, other than lower new raw materials depletion. © 2023, The Author(s)."

The purpose of this research is to determine the proportional impacts of domestic and foreign capital to environmental degradation in newly industrialized nations (NICs). For this reason, panel data methodology is used to evaluate, for the years 1991 to 2018, how the ecological footprint is affected by stock market capitalization, foreign direct investment, economic growth, urbanization, and energy intensity. Using the squared terms of stock market capitalization and foreign direct investment, respectively, it is also looked at whether domestic and foreign capital may have non-linear effects on the environment. According to the empirical findings, whereas local capital growth worsens the environment, increasing international capital prevents environmental degradation. There is an inverted U-shaped link between domestic capital and environmental degradation in the event of non-linearity, but foreign capital has a monotonically declining effect on environmental degradation. The study outcomes are utilized to design a policy framework to address the objectives of SDG 7, SDG 11, and SDG 13. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

All these shortcomings create a non-sustainability in the environment, which is of great concern. In order to overcome such issues, a hybrid system is designed that is composed of various components or sources like wind energy, solar photovoltaic energy, thermal energy, and battery energy storage with the purpose of providing an environmentally friendly, economically viable, sustainable, and reliable solution. The objective is to reduce the carbon capture, carbon utilization, and carbon footprint. The carbon footprint is measured as the optimal difference between carbon capture (CC) and its utilization (CU), and carbon emission is represented as loss of carbon emission (LCE). Another objective is to reduce the optimal size of components, the distortion level, and the optimal cost in terms of loss of cost of energy (LCOE) for the various values of loss of power supply probability (LPSP). All the above objectives are accomplished by designing a nonlinear multi-objective problem. The designed nonlinear multi-objective function is based on a hybrid hysteresis fuzzy algorithm. The proposed algorithm is a combination of both fuzzy logic controllers and the hysteresis band method. The effectiveness of the proposed topology is tested on an IEEE standard 9 bus system. It is observed that a nonlinear hybrid hysteresis fuzzy algorithm provides a reliable and sustainable solution for optimal cost with a reduced effective carbon footprint and minimal distortion by maintaining the proper balance between carbon capturing and carbon utilization. The average values of LCOE,LCE, CU, and CC with the proposed method for various LPSP are found to be 0.5926 /KWh, 70.64 g CO2/kWh, 89 g CO2/kWh, and 159 g CO2/kWh, which are the least among all methods. © 2016 IEEE."

Although environmental advantages can be expected for such systems, several aspects should be considered when evaluating its environmental suitability. In this sense, while a complete life-cycle assessment of photocatalytic systems typically involves concerns linked to the low maturity of these technologies and its associated lack of data, this article proposes a novel methodological approach, in the form of a scoring dashboard, to environmentally benchmark technical aspects in photocatalytic hydrogen production. It is based on the identification and quantification of technical and environmental hotspots and thresholds for photocatalytic technologies targeted at producing green hydrogen. In order to illustrate the proposed approach, a case study with alternative process configurations is implemented in the methodological framework. Through this case study, the proposed configurations are assessed in terms of carbon footprint by focusing on three key aspects: sacrificial agent, power consumption, and direct CO2 emissions. In particular, two options for methanol as the sacrificial agent and two options for electricity as energy required for pumping and hydrogen compression are explored. The results show a relevant influence of the sacrificial agent source on the carbon footprint of the produced hydrogen, for which its bio-based origin would be key for the produced hydrogen to be deemed green. The proposed methodological approach is concluded to be a practical solution to benchmark photocatalytic hydrogen production systems, representing a straightforward way to define technical objectives and guide research efforts. © 2023 The Authors"

There is an immediate need of decarbonisation and a push for a smooth transition to a world with no net carbon emissions. To achieve sustainability, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) firms are increasing their efforts to reduce their carbon footprint across their supply chains. The firms and government undertake several initiatives towards achieving the zero carbon mission. Hence, there is a need to identify the prominent enablers that may enhance the decarbonisation in the FMCG sector and contribute towards a net-zero carbon economy. The current study has identified and assessed the enablers (6 main criteria, 19 sub-criteria), including green innovation, green supply chain, sustainable decision-making, organisation decisions and government control from environment, social and governance (ESG) perspective. Eco-friendly manufacturing techniques and eco-friendly goods may give businesses a competitive edge and sustainability. The six primary factors that can help to reduce decarbonisation are evaluated using the stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) technique. The criteria and sub-criteria are assessed by SWARA method. A total of 32 experts from the FMCG industry are undertaken to validate and assess the enablers. This study identified and evaluated the ESG-based decarbonisation enablers in FMCG. The study shows that green innovations are ranked first, followed by organisational decisions and government control. This is likely the first study to examine how the FMCG industry’s enablers for decreasing carbon footprints connect. The study is helpful to the supply chain managers and the other decision makers to implement well-designed processes for creating new products and a supply chain from the point of purchase to the place of supply, all backed by advanced technology and the appropriate regulatory adjustments. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

The structural and optical properties of AC derived from Quercus Alba using four chemical activation agents, namely H3PO4, KOH, FeCl3, and ZnCl2, were examined. The carbon content of Quercus Alba highly increased up to 73% when KOH was used as an activator. The results showed that among the ACs examined in this study, the one activated by H3PO4 had the highest surface area. The LCA method is designed to estimate certain major environmental consequences that occur during the activation phase. SimaPro 8.2 LCA software was used and the CML 2 baseline 2000 approach was used for environmental impact assessment. The use of power in laboratory steps was the most damaging to the environment. Moreover, the AC sample produced using KOH had the biggest ecological footprint in most effect categories. Further, the most relevant environmental effect category was marine aquatic ecotoxicity and terrestrial acidification. Global warming potential had also a high impact which was 3.12 kg CO2 eq for AC by ZnCl2. The chemical activation agents played a substantial role in the environmental implications of activated carbon production. By combining the laboratory-scale production of AC from Quercus Alba with a direct assessment of its environmental impact, it could be concluded that Quercus Alba could be a viable material for AC from an economic and environmental perspective by using a suitable activation agent. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Iranian Society of Environmentalists (IRSEN) and Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University."

Synthesis of polymeric materials from biobased resources also solves the problem of polymer waste recycling. This chapter covers a basic background on the origin and importance of biobased polyamides, different synthetic routes of their starting monomeric materials obtained from biomass feedstocks, and a brief summary of the physical and chemical properties and applications of some common aliphatic, semiaromatic and fully aromatic polyamides.

Land use optimization and land parcel allocation are essential areas of agriculture research that currently represent relevant challenges and are classified as combinatorial optimization problems. In this context, the Selection and Allocation of Land Parcels Problem (SA-LPP) is proposed; its goal is to optimize the selection and allocation of land parcels with rectangular shapes in small areas available for food production. We propose a reformulation of the SA-LPP as a variant of the two-dimensional orthogonal packing problem (2OPP), called Group-2OPP. This problem was solved through a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model, but due to the model complexity, we also propose a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure metaheuristic approach. Some sensitivity analyses were performed as well to evaluate the impact of parameters on the solutions. Computational results show that the proposed metaheuristic outperforms the MILP model in terms of solution quality and computational times. © 2022 The Authors.

Prior literature suggests that the introduction of up to 0.5 wt % chlorella biological matter (biomatter) in ordinary Portland cement induces a retardation of the composite cement’s strength evolution while enabling a long-term compressive strength comparable to pure cement at a lower carbon footprint. In this work, we provide insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing this retardation effect and reveal a concentration threshold above which the presence of biomatter completely hinders the hydration reactions. We incorporate Chlorella or Spirulina, two algal species with different morphology and composition, in ordinary Portland cement at concentrations ranging between 0.5 and 15 wt % and study the evolution of mechanical properties of the resulting biocomposites over a period of 91 days. The compressive strength in both sets of biocomposites exhibits a concentration-dependent long-term drastic reduction, which plateaus at 5 wt % biomatter content. At and above 5 wt %, all biocomposites show a strength reduction of more than 80% after 91 days of curing compared to pure cement, indicating a permanent hindrance effect on hardening. Characterization of the hydration kinetics and the cured materials shows that both algal biomatters hinder the hydration reactions of calcium silicates, preventing the formation of calcium hydroxide and calcium silicate hydrate, while the secondary reactions of tricalcium aluminate that form ettringite are not affected. We propose that the alkaline conditions during cement hydration lead to the formation of charged glucose-based carbohydrates, which subsequently create a hydrogen bonding network that ultimately encapsulates calcium silicates. This encapsulation prevents the formation of primary hydrate products and thus blocks the hardening of cement. Furthermore, we observe new hydration products with composition and micromorphology deviating from the expected hardened cement compounds. Our analysis provides fundamental insights into the mechanisms that govern the introduction of two carbon-negative algal species as fillers in cement, which are crucial for enabling strategies to overcome the detrimental effects that those fillers have on the mechanical properties of cement. © 2023 American Chemical Society."

By designing modern automation techniques, smart buildings can significantly reduce energy consumption, protect the environment, and consequently improve quality of life. This article focuses on the automation of elevator scheduling, which is an NP-Hard problem, to reduce energy usage in smart buildings and improve users' quality of experience. We propose an optimal mathematical model for the elevator scheduling problem using integer programming. We then propose a novel game-theoretic approach that captures interactions within the elevator system to reduce energy consumption and enhance user experience. We propose a request coalition formation game, where nonoverlapping coalitions of user requests are served by elevators to minimize their movements and energy consumption while reducing service time and stops for users. We analyze the performance of our proposed approach using the optimal solution as a benchmark and Nearest Car and Fixed Sectoring algorithms as rivals. The experiments show that our approach is significantly efficient in terms of energy consumption and service time, making it suitable for smart buildings.  © 2013 IEEE."

It requires a fundamental understanding of the choices available to urban dwellers and of the equity and justice implications of green mobility solutions. In this study, we quantified personal mobility-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) and their associations with various land use, built environment, and socioeconomic factors. Our study captured personal, household, and neighborhood-level characteristics that are related to high emissions and disparities in emissions across the study region. We observed that the top 30% of emitters generated 70% of all transportation GHG emissions. Household income, family size, and vehicle ownership were associated with increased mobility emissions, while increased population density was associated with lower emissions. The percentage of visible minorities in a neighborhood was associated with lower emissions, but this effect was small. We further contrasted the spatial distribution of traffic-related air pollution with mobility GHG emissions. The results suggest that individuals who emit less GHG live in areas with higher air pollution. A computer vision-based model was used to predict GHG emissions from aerial images of neighborhoods, demonstrating that areas with high land use mixture were linked to a lower generation of mobility-based GHG emissions. © 2023 American Chemical Society."

Objective: The aim was to provide the first rigorous life cycle assessment of reusable and disposable flexible cystoscopes. Design, setting, and participants: We performed a life cycle assessment of reusable flexible cystoscopes and the aS4C single-use cystoscope (aScope; Ambu, Ballerup, Denmark). For the aScope, the complete lifespan of the scope was evaluated, including raw material extraction, material formulation, component production, product assembly, distribution, transportation after use, and final disposal. For reusable cystoscopes, we limited our analysis to their reprocessing, using a model consisting of standard high-level disinfection with peracetic acid. The environmental impact was evaluated by an independent third-party consulting company APESA (Technopole Hélioparc, Pau, France) dedicated to such risk assessments. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: The environmental footprint of both cystoscopes was assessed using five environmental impact categories, namely, climate change, mineral resource depletion, ecotoxicity, acidification, and eutrophication. To perform the life cycle assessment, Simapro v9.3.3 software was used and the Ecoinvent v3.5 database was employed as the primary life cycle inventory database. A Monte Carlo analysis was used to account for the inherent uncertainty in life cycle inventory data and the variability in material and energy consumption for each type of flexible cystoscope. Results and limitations: By only comparing the disinfection reprocessing of reusable cystoscopes with the complete lifespan of the single-use cystoscope, the use of the aScope would allow a reduction of at least 33% in the climate change category, 50% in the mineral resources’ depletion category, 51% in the ecotoxicity category, 71% in the acidification category, and 49% in the eutrophication category. Our results cannot be generalized to all health care facilities as we studied only one type of reprocessing method and one disposable flexible cystoscope. Conclusions: Disinfection reprocessing of reusable cystoscopes was found to have a significantly larger environmental footprint and impact than the whole lifespan of the single-use cystoscope aScope. Patient summary: Using a cradle-to-grave life cycle analysis, we showed that the environmental footprint of a flexible cystoscopy procedure can be reduced by using a disposable cystoscope instead of a reusable cystoscope. © 2022 European Association of Urology"

The sizing and operation of such systems have to take into account the aging of the fuel cell. This paper focuses on the study of a potential impact of high frequency current ripples (HFCR) on the degradation of a high-temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (HT-PEMFC). A 2600 h long endurance test was carried out on 4 HT-PEMFC single cells with and without HFCR. The degradation of two cells operated with a triangular current waveform of frequency 20 kHz and amplitude 20 %pp of the mean current density (0.2 A/cm2) is compared to the degradation of two cells operated at the same constant mean current density. In addition to endurance phase, several characterization phases (polarization curves, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry) are used to analyse the impact of the current harmonics. The obtained results show that the high frequency current ripples do not seem to accelerate the degradation of the HT-PEMFC single cells. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC"

Decarbonization of electricity production is key to reach climate goals, influencing all sectors including construction The objective of this paper is to study the sensitivity of the environmentally optimum building design solution to a changing electricity mix to assist decision-making. Methods: In this paper, multi-objective optimization was applied to minimize the life cycle global warming potential and life cycle costs of a building at the same time, using dynamic energy simulation and LCA. The variables include building envelope parameters such as window ratio, insulation type and thickness in a typical new multi-family apartment building heated with a heat pump. A static, largely fossil-based electricity mix and a dynamic, gradually decarbonizing alternative are considered, as well as two electricity price increase scenarios. New metrics have been introduced to explore the results and describe the Pareto-optimal solutions, for example the improvement potential to contextualize the achievements through the optimization. Results and discussion: The results show that, with the current electricity mix, building envelope optimization can improve the design by 18% on average in terms of the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to typical new designs and by 10% with a dynamic mix in Hungary. With today’s static electricity mix, the optimization proved that the minimum energy efficiency requirements in force are close to cost optimality. However, from an environmental point of view, much higher insulation thicknesses have been shown as justified (U-values of less than 0.1 W/m2K). Conclusions: Optimization of building design based on LCA is still not widely applied and the effect of a decarbonizing electricity mix on the optimum has not been studied before. The results of the paper demonstrate the importance of this question. Optimal solutions are different depending on the applied mix but an energy-efficient building envelope remains important: today’s cost-optimal building envelope proves to be both cost- and environmentally optimal in the long run. © 2022, The Author(s)."

The proposed approach encrypts private information by adding a noise term and a secret function to the information exchange process. The convergence, optimality, and privacy of the proposed privacy-preserving distributed approach are rigorously analyzed using a theoretical approach and verified by various case studies on IEEE distribution systems.  © 1969-2012 IEEE."

Evidence from China,Article,Khalid T.; Wen J.; Khalid M.; Khalid S.; Zakaria M.; Mahmood H.,Engineering Economics,34.0,2023,323,334,10.5755/j01.ee.34.3.32818,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163690948&doi=10.5755%2fj01.ee.34.3.32818&partnerID=40&md5=c5b45626e3af4af0769df583676c86b2,13922785,Scopus,ARDL; China; Ecological Footprint; Environmental degradation; Technological Innovation,"Developed and developing countries are trying to achieve sustainable growth in the present era. Unfortunately, despite being the world’s largest developing country, China is among those countries that have a high ecological footprint as it emits 27 % of global carbon emissions in 2021. However, the encouraging fact is that China has become an emerging economy due to technological advancement. Many existing studies have suggested that technological innovation can overcome environmental degradation. Therefore, this study examines whether technological innovation has reduced environmental degradation in China from 1985 to 2018. This study uses the ecological footprint to measure environmental degradation in China. Furthermore, this study also explores the role of economic growth, trade openness, and population on environment. To estimate the models, ARDL cointegration technique is applied, and the findings are further validated using CCR, DOLS, FMOLS, and Granger causality techniques. Overall, empirical results indicate that technological advancement negatively impacts China’s short-and long-term ecological footprint. This is understandable because more innovation leads to better technology that consumes fewer resources and has lower ecological footprints. However, environmental degradation is exacerbated by economic growth and population growth, whereas trade openness helps to mitigate environmental degradation in China. The diagnostic analysis of the study confirms the absence of heteroscedasticity, multicollinearity, and model instability. The study recommends using eco-friendly technologies that can reduce the usage of harmful alternative energy sources. Furthermore, carbon emissions need to be taxed, and environment friendly technologies need to be supported to promote long-term economic growth. © 2023, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

Flame detection techniques, such as ion sensing and optical diagnostics, have been reported for diagnosing combustion status. In this paper, a flame front detection technique based on active plasma probing is introduced and analyzed. Unlike the conventional ion sensing used in internal combustion engines, a separate electrode gap is used to detect the flame front arrival. Further, the voltage potential across the electrodes of the spark plug probe is modulated actively to be slightly below the breakdown threshold prior to flame arrival. At the arrival of the flame front, the ions in the flame tend to decrease the breakdown voltage threshold and trigger a breakdown event. An optically accessible constant volume combustion vessel is employed to investigate the efficacy of such active plasma probing for the detection of the flame front under quiescent and flow conditions. Three types of fuels are used in the tests, including methane, propane, and DME, with an air fuel ratio sweep (from stoichiometric to extremely lean) for each fuel. Efforts are made to characterize the probing criteria of minimum, yet adequate voltage to succeed in the detection of the arrival and departure of the flame front most sensitively and reliably, for all three types of fuels under various mixture strengths. For comparison, conventional ion current measurements are conducted under identical background conditions to benchmark the efficacy of flame detection. Results show that the active plasma probing can promptly detect the arrival and departure of the flame front, robustly regardless of the fuel type and excess air ratios. The precise control of the detecting voltage is key for reliable flame detection with high sensitivity. © IMechE 2022."

This study seeks to establish the feasibility of harvesting winter pruned vineyard biomass (PVB) for potential use in carbon footprint reduction as a renewable biofuel for energy production. Of particular interest is the role PVB plays as a carbon source in vineyard soils and what effect annual removal might have on soil carbon. An investigation was carried out in the Coombe vineyard, Waite Campus (University of Adelaide), Australia. Vines are grown in a Vertic clay loam soil with well-managed mid-row swards in a temperate zone. A comparison was undertaken of two mid-row treatments after 13 years of consistent management: 1) the deliberate exclusion of PVB from every third row, and 2) in the remaining rows PVB was incorporated at an average of 3.4 and 5.5 t/ha in two 0.25 ha blocks containing Shiraz and Semillon respectively. In both 0-10 cm and 10-30 cm soil core sample depths, combined soil carbon % values in the desired range of 1.80 to 3.50 were not significantly different between treatments or cultivars and yielded an estimated 42 t/ha of soil carbon. Other key physical and chemical values were likewise not significantly different between treatments. Results suggest that in a temperate zone vineyard, managed such as the one used in this study, there is no long-term negative impact on soil carbon sequestration through removing PVB. This implies that growers could confidently harvest PVB for use in biofuel production. © 2023, International Viticulture and Enology Society. All rights reserved."

The study uses annual data for real GDP, real trade, energy intensity, urbanization, foreign direct investment, ecological footprints, and wind and solar energy production. For econometric analysis, common correlated mean group (CCE-MG), cross-section-distributive lag (CS-DL), and cross-section autoregressive-distributive lag (CS-ARDL) approaches are employed. The outcomes show that real GDP has a significantly positive influence on ecological footprint. At the same time, wind and solar energy negatively and significantly influence ecological footprint. It is argued that a 1 % increase in wind and solar energy reduces ecological footprint by 3.1 % and 2.9 %, respectively. For policy recommendations, the study recommended that wind and solar energy resources may become more noticeable for electricity purposes despite rising investments in these energy resources. Indeed, the share of wind and solar energy production is limited and dominated by non-renewable energy resources, so low-carbon energy resources might be encouraged. © 2023 International Association for Gondwana Research"

However, as a novel crop, the cost-effectiveness and environmental feasibility of carinata feedstock are unknown, and there are questions about the optimal supply chain configuration for carinata-based SAF production. This study aims to design a supply chain model for carinata-based SAF production by optimizing the location of farms and facilities (e.g. storage units, crushing mills, biorefineries) for a minimum transportation cost under a set of supply and demand conditions. An integrated mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model was combined with geographical information system (GIS) analysis to design a spatially explicit supply chain configuration. The GIS-based network analysis considered all of the counties in Georgia to set the candidate locations of carinata farms and facilities, and determined minimum cost and emission routes between those counties and the airport using existing transportation networks and modes (e.g. road, rail and pipeline). The MILP model determined the final selection of the farms and the number of facilities and their locations over those minimum-cost routes. With this supply chain configuration, the minimum price of SAF was $0.92 L−1, which is $0.44 higher than conventional aviation fuel (CAF). The associated carbon intensity of SAF was estimated at 940.7 g CO2e L−1, a reduction of 66% relative to the carbon intensity of equivalent CAF. The study found that a carbon tax (or subsidy) of $230.48 t CO2e−1 would be needed to overcome the cost differential with CAF and promote carinata-based SAF in Georgia. Published 2023.

However, minimal research explores the WEC and value-added nexus efficiency of the Yellow Basin River (YRB) with a comprehensive framework. Thus, this study built a nexus framework based on a multiregional input-output model (MRIO) to analyze embodied WEC and value-added flows in the nine provinces of the YRB and all 31 provinces of China, primarily in 2017 compared to 2012 and 2015. Three dimensions (space, sectors, and environmental and economic factors) depict the WEC and value-added nexus patterns. The results from these three dimensions uncovered that the YRB benefits from regional trade but suffers environmental losses, and the development imbalance among the provinces of the basin is exacerbated. The proposed integrated framework can be generalized to water-energy extended nexus analysis in other regions to portray a more complex human-environment system nexus pattern. The new knowledge of how embodied WEC interacts with concomitant economic activities within and beyond the YRB can benefit multiresource-integrated management in the YRB and coordinated regional development in China. © 2023 American Chemical Society."

Therefore, the development of projects with a low carbon footprint is of crucial importance. Although several active and passive solutions as well as design strategies have been developed, identifying critical levers to minimise GHG emissions and the cost of future building projects is still a problem faced every day by designers. Methods: Motivated by this knowledge gap in this study, we conducted a life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) of a residential building situated in Austria. To identify the critical levers for reducing impacts and cost, 37 scenarios with three different advanced energetic standards are created. The scenarios with the various standards are developed through the combination of different construction materials, insulation materials and technical building equipment. In the eco-efficiency assessment (LCA and LCCA), a reference study period of 50 years is assumed. The life cycle of the building scenarios was analysed according to the European standard EN-15978. Results: Results show that improving the energetic standard does not yield an overall cost savings potential. The additional construction cost (23%) for energy efficiency measures, including thermal insulation and change of technical building equipment, is higher than the reduction potential in operating cost over 50 years. On the other hand, the improvement of energetic standards allows a reduction of the environmental impacts by 25%. Conclusions: To ensure a cost-optimal environmental improvement of buildings, it is crucial to conduct an eco-efficiency assessment during the design process of energy-efficient buildings. This study shows how improving the energetic standard of buildings can reduce environmental impacts with slightly increased life cycle cost. © 2022, The Author(s)."

The Canary Islands have high level of tourism, with tourists who generally travel in rented vehicles on arrival in the archipelago. In addition, mobility of the local population in the islands is also always growing. Thus, transport is one of the sectors that emits the greatest amount of greenhouse gases. In this sense, the net carbon balance becomes a pioneering study in the framework of management of high-capacity road transport routes and will help plan new strategies, which pursue the neutrality and climate resilience of the road network. It will therefore be possible to design different future scenarios, according to traffic intensities detected, to mitigate their local effects by increasing green areas, which will contribute to greater absorption. This study calculated the carbon footprint linked to vehicles on the three high-capacity roads on the island of Tenerife, as well as the carbon footprint of the public lighting attached to these roads. The absorption of carbon by vegetation planted by the Road Service and the soil located on the margins of the road have also been calculated to explore the possibility of modifying the vegetation, using other types of local shrubs and trees that have a higher absorption factor. The results demonstrate that conifers have the highest absorption factor, the Canary Island pine being the best option in this case. However, it is not always possible to place trees on the roadside, and it is necessary to resort to smaller species. This study concludes that better mobility planning, an increase in electric vehicles, improved energy production from renewable sources, and the promotion and enhancement of absorption capacity of carbon sinks are key in the face of climate change.

Photocatalytic water splitting using solar radiation is a promising H2 technology. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) and carbon nitride (g–C3N4)–based photocatalysts are the most widely used photocatalytic materials because of their activity and abundance. Several attempts have been made to improve the photocatalytic performance of these materials in terms of their activity level, life span, response to visible radiation, and stability. However, the environmental impacts of these modifications are often not included in existing studies. This research, therefore, develops a cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment (LCA) framework to evaluate and compare the GHG footprints of four alternative pathways: TiO2 nanorods and fluorine-doped carbon nitride quantum dots embedded with TiO2 (CNF: TNR/TiO2), g-C3N4, and g-C3N4/BiOI composite. Unlike most studies that focus only on certain stages such as laboratory-scale photocatalytic fabrication, this study includes utility-scale cell production, assembly, operation, and end of life to give a more accurate and precise environmental performance estimation. The results show that g-C3N4/BiOI has the lowest GHG footprint (0.38 kg CO2 eq per kg of H2) and CNF: TNR/TiO2 has the lowest energy payback time (0.4 years). In every pathway, energy use in material extraction processes makes up the largest GHG contribution, between 83% and 89%. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses were conducted under the impact of various input parameters on the life cycle GHG emissions of hydrogen production.

Methods This was a retrospective observational study of colorectal polyps resected during 2019, within the Imperial College Healthcare Trust. The numbers of pots for polypectomy specimens were calculated and corresponding histology results were extracted. We modelled the potential reduction in carbon footprint if all less than 10 mm polyps were sent together and the number of advanced lesions we would not be able to locate if we adopted this strategy. Carbon footprint was estimated based on previous study using a life-cycle assessment, at 0.28 kgCO 2 e per pot. Results A total of 11 781 lower gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed. There were 5125 polyps removed and 4192 pots used, equating to a carbon footprint of 1174 kgCO 2 e. There were 4563 (89%) polyps measuring 0-10 mm. 6 (0.1%) of these polyps were cancers, while 12 (0.2%) demonstrated high-grade dysplasia. If we combined all small polyps in a single pot, total pot usage could be reduced by one-third (n=2779). Conclusion A change in practice by placing small polyps collectively in one pot would have resulted in reduction in carbon footprint equivalent to 396 kgCO 2 e (emissions from 982 miles driven by an average passenger car). The reduction in carbon footprint from judicious use of specimen pots would be amplified with a change in practice on a national level. © 2023 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved."

However, they are inefficient in converting light to electricity due to poor hole extraction at perovskite/carbon interface. Here we enable an efficient hole extraction in C-IPSCs with the aid of inorganic p-type nickel oxide nanoparticles (NiOx-NPs) at the interface and in carbon. By tailoring the work function (WF) of carbon, and reducing the energy-level misalignment at the perovskite/carbon interface, NiOx-NPs enable efficient hole transfer, reduce charge recombination and minimize energy loss. As a result, we report 15.01% and 11.02% efficiencies for CsPbI2Br and CsPbIBr2 C-IPSCs, respectively, with a high open-circuit voltage of ∼1.3 V. Unencapsulated interface-modified CsPbI2Br devices maintained 92.8% of their initial efficiency at ambient conditions after nearly 2,000 h; and 94.6% after heating at 60 °C for 170 h. This strategy to tailor carbon interface with perovskite offers an important knob in improving C-IPSCs performance. © 2023 Elsevier Inc."

However, its environmental impacts, especially those associated with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in different cropping seasons, remain unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the carbon dioxide equivalences (CO2-eq) occurring during various weather seasons (early rainy, late rainy, and dry seasons) of maize production. Life cycle costing (LCC) associated with grain production were also evaluated. Methods: A total of 131 plantation land plots in dominant areas of maize plantation in Chiang Rai, Nan, Tak, Phetchabun, and Loei Provinces were selected for data collection. The system boundaries included the cultivation, grain drying, and transportation of grain to feed mills. A carbon movement categorization method was employed to determine CO2 equivalences including carbon emissions, fixation, and reduction. The functional unit used for CO2 equivalences evaluation was either kg CO2-eq/ha or kg CO2-eq/ton grain. LCC was used as analytical tool to examine the total cost and net profit of maize production among different cropping seasons. Results and discussion: Total GHG emissions from maize production were found to be an average of 429 ± 27 kg CO2-eq/ton grain. The highest emissions among different seasons of maize production were during the dry season which were 2970 ± 792 kg CO2-eq/ha. However, no significant difference was observed between total emissions per unit of grain produced in the different seasons. The results of LCC of maize grain production revealed that the net economic benefits per carbon emitted during the early rainy, late rainy, and dry seasons were 0.44, 0.49, and 0.50 USD/kg CO2-eq, respectively. These confirmed that the dry season exhibited greater economic benefits compared with rainy seasons. Moreover, the carbon fixation efficiency was computed to be 79.0–80.2%, indicating that maize production still emits carbon to the atmosphere. Conclusions and recommendations: This study evaluated CO2 emissions from different cropping seasons of maize production to identify the most suitable cropping season in terms of lower CO2 emissions and higher net economic benefit. These findings may be used to effect better government policy on reducing GHG emissions and managing land use for maize cultivation in Thailand. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
1238,Analysis of carbon footprint and energy performance of biohydrogen production through gasification of different waste agricultural biomass from the Philippines,Article,Reaño R.L.; Halog A.,Biomass Conversion and Biorefinery,13.0,2023,8685,8699,10.1007/s13399-020-01151-9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096321869&doi=10.1007%2fs13399-020-01151-9&partnerID=40&md5=7b5ecc58fdaf93eb908dc3b757b4f268,21906815,Scopus,Biohydrogen; Biophysical allocation; Carbon footprint; Gasification; Sensitivity analysis,"Agricultural crop residues are available in abundance in Asian countries such as the Philippines. These residues have high potential as feedstock to produce clean and high-value energy products, to mitigate global warming and reduce dependence on fossil fuels. This study investigated the carbon footprint and energy performance of biohydrogen production system through gasification of different waste agricultural biomass. The proposed system includes biomass transport and pre-processing, gasification process, and biohydrogen enrichment and purification technologies. Calculation of the syngas composition was performed using a stoichiometric-thermodynamic equilibrium model using python script. Generation of energy from fossil fuel to support the system operations produced the highest greenhouse gas emission. The production system using sugarcane leaves as feedstocks exhibited the lowest carbon footprint, highest gasification efficiency, and best energy performance based on the computed energy ratio. Biophysical allocation was used to determine the burden associated with the biomass during its growth phase. Incorporation of the carbon uptake during biomass growth phase reduced the carbon footprint of the system. Sensitivity analysis showed that increasing C/O and H/O ratio improves the quality of the syngas produced, while increasing C/H ratio results to lower biohydrogen yield. In selection of feedstock mix, it is preferred to maximize C/O and H/O ratio while reducing C/H ratio of the feedstock composition. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

After agrochemicals (71.7% CE), residue burning (16.4% CE) was recorded to be the largest contributor of CE in the state, followed by irrigation (6.9% CE). Among the three major zones, CE was recorded to be 13.4%, 58.5% and 28.1% in the North-West, Central and South-West zone, respectively, with being highest and lowest in Central and North-West zone, respectively. The average annual CF (t CO2 eq/t) was recorded to be 1.11 ± 0.23, 0.94 ± 0.05 and 0.99 ± 0.06 t CO2 eq/t for North-West, Central and South-West zones, respectively, with a total value of 3.04 ± 0.34 t CO2 eq/t at state level. On average, CF of the state indicated an increasing trend from 0.96 t CO2 eq/t in 2017–2018 to 1.09 t CO2 eq/t in 2019–2020. The higher CF values indicated higher GHGS emission in relation to groundwater pumping, fertilizer and pesticide applications, mechanical operations and post-harvest residue burning. Although rice production is very much needed for food security of the region, however, the quantitative and qualitative depletions of available resources (water, soil fertility, air quality, etc.) have started imposing negative impacts on agricultural production and environment. Thus, there is a need to take immediate remedial measures and reduce the over-exploitation of groundwater, over-use of fertilizers and pesticides, and burning of post-harvest paddy residue in the state. © 2023, The International Society of Paddy and Water Environment Engineering."

Yet, PPC suffers from unsatisfactory thermal and mechanical properties, and its blends with other synthetic polymers as the second component typically exhibit poor compatibility. Herein, novel furan-based non-isocyanate polyurethanes (NIPUs) with high molecular weights and narrow distributions have been synthesized starting from 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) via a four-step procedure including reduction, glycidylation, carbonation of CO2 and step-growth polymerization with diamines. Owing to the structural similarity and intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions, furan-based NIPUs display good compatibility with PPC. A sea-island morphology can be observed in SEM images of PPC/NIPU blends, where the NIPU phases are randomly dispersed in the PPC matrix. Moreover, the blends exhibit only one Tg (higher than both that of PPC and the corresponding NIPU) on the DSC curves, which first increase and then decrease when increasing the content of NIPUs from 0 wt% to 15 wt%. Notably, the physical crosslinking formed by hydrogen bonding interactions, coupled with the rigidity of furan rings, confer simultaneous improvements of elongation at the break and tensile strength, affording high-performance CO2-based biodegradable polymeric materials with low carbon footprint, good sustainability, and ideal biocompatibility. © 2023, Chinese Chemical Society Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences."

Herein, an efficient MoC-Mo2C electrode synthesized in molten salt was reported for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in a simulated chlor-alkali cell. The MoC-Mo2C electrode displays a low overpotential of 179 mV at 500 mA cm-2, which is much lower than that of a low-carbon steel electrode (η500 = 436 mV) for the HER in chlor-alkali conditions (i.e., 3 M NaOH + 3 M NaCl at 85 °C), and it exhibited high stability within 100 h. Furthermore, the effects of NaOH and NaCl concentrations and operating temperatures on its performance for the HER were systematically investigated. The honeycomb-like porous morphology, good hydrophilicity, and unique electronic structure of the electrode are the reasons for its excellent HER activity and durability. This work extends a novel excellent and cost-affordable self-standing MoC-Mo2C HER electrode for application in the chlor-alkali industry, which would greatly reduce the energy consumption of the process. © 2023 American Chemical Society"

The research includes the fabrication of nine GEWC circular compression elements with different reinforcement ratios and a 3-D nonlinear finite element model using ABAQUS. The study involves a detailed parametric analysis to examine the impact of various parameters on the behavior of GEWC compression elements. The results indicate that reducing the vertical distance of glass-FRP ties improves the ductility of GEWC compression elements, and those with eight longitudinal rebars have higher axial load-carrying capacities. The finite element predictions were in good agreement with the testing results, and the put forwarded empirical model shows higher accuracy than previous models by involving the confinement effect of lateral glass-FRP ties on the axial strength of GEWC compression elements.

Yet, few tourism scholars have studied the meaning of the pace at which cycle tourists move. This study seeks to shed some light on cycle tourists' relationship to time and pace. For that purpose, mobile ethnography through participant observation and interviews was employed to explore how western tourists experience a package cycling holiday in Vietnam. The cyclists' notion of subjective pace was found to be unconnected from actual velocity or form of travel. Some of the tourists sought speed and closely monitored time as ways to achieve their cycling performance goals. None of the cyclists expressed concerns with the high carbon footprint of their air travel to Vietnam. Furthermore, contrary to the slow travel literature, the cycle tourists did not prioritise social encounters. The findings of this study, therefore, question whether package cycle tourists can be considered to be slow travellers. We thus suggest that the experience of pace as controlled by the traveller her or himself is central to being a slow traveller. © The Author(s) 2022."

In this paper, coal mining to oil production is taken as a life cycle to evaluate the carbon footprint and levelized costs of direct-coal-to-liquid and indirect-coal-to-liquid coupled with the carbon capture utilization and storage technology under three scenarios: non capture, process capture, process and public capture throughout the life cycle. The results show that, first, the coupling carbon capture utilization and storage technology can reduce CO2 footprint by 28%–57% from 5.91 t CO2/t oil of direct-coal-to-liquid and 24%–49% from 7.10 t CO2/t oil of indirect-coal-to-liquid. Next, the levelized cost of direct-coal-to-liquid is 648–1027 $/t of oil, whereas that of indirect-coal-to-liquid is 653–1065 $/t of oil. When coupled with the carbon capture utilization and storage technology, the levelized cost of direct-coal-to-liquid is 285–1364 $/t of oil, compared to 1101–9793 $/t of oil for indirect-coal-to-liquid. Finally, sensitivity analysis shows that CO2 transportation distance has the greatest impact on carbon footprint, while coal price and initial investment cost significantly affect the levelized cost of coal-to-liquid. © 2023, Higher Education Press."

Cement additives tailor short- and long-term cement properties for various well conditions to ensure well integrity. Although various additives exist, the current trend in reducing the carbon footprint motivates the developing ""greener” additives that are environmentally friendly and made from renewable and sustainable sources such as cellulose nanocrystals (CNC). CNCs exhibit superior properties and have shown significant impact on cement slurry, including increased degree of hydration, strength, and altered properties. However, most studies on CNCs are intended for construction industry rather than hydrocarbon and geothermal well cementing. Investigating the use of CNCs as high-performance cement additives is therefore of interest due to their potential benefits. This study aims to determine the effect of CNC on vital well cement properties. The effects of CNC were determined using standard American Petroleum Institute (API) test procedures and equipment in an experimental approach. The experimental findings indicate that the addition of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) at a concentration of 2 vol% resulted in a notable increase of 7% in viscosity, a significant decrease of 50% in free water, a remarkable reduction of 78% in cement shrinkage, and no discernible effect on slurry thickening time. Furthermore, the inclusion of a 0.2 vol% of CNC yielded a significant surge of 56% in compressive strength after 21 days and accelerated 500 psi strength development by 9%. However, the investigation revealed that a concentration of 1.5 vol% of CNC represents a threshold concentration or the turning point, beyond which the addition of CNC can negatively impact the studied cement properties. © 2023 Sichuan Petroleum Administration"

In the preparation of concrete, recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) are encouraged instead of natural aggregates (NA), as they can help reduce the consumption of virgin materials, the extraction and transportation of which can be costly and environmentally damaging. In this context, we conducted an experimental study on various concrete mixes to evaluate the effect of using RCA instead of NA on the physical and mechanical properties of fresh and hardened concrete. The main novelty of our study lies in meeting one of the principles of circular economy, i.e., reducing the carbon footprint, by recycling concrete waste collected locally. We prepared and investigated test specimens containing 0%, 20%, 40%, and 60% of fine and coarse recycled concrete aggregates. Results for fresh concrete were determined for temperature, consistency, air content, and density, while on the other side, in hardened concrete, results were determined for compressive strength, tensile splitting strength, and density. All results were determined experimentally and then compared. Our results showed that, with the use of RCA in the concrete mix, construction companies can significantly reduce their carbon footprints and help conserve natural resources. RCA can help create a more sustainable and affordable construction industry and is better suited to meet future challenges. Our study can serve as a basis for advancing the application of RCA in the preparation of concrete for sustainable construction. © Authors retain all copyrights."

Among the solutions that have been proven to be effective in reducing the energy consumption of wireless networks is the use of machine learning algorithms in cell traffic management. However, despite promising results, it should be noted that the computations required by machine learning algorithms have increased at an exponential rate. Massive computing has a surprisingly large carbon footprint, which could affect its real-world deployment. Thus, additional attention needs to be paid to the design and parameterization of these algorithms applied in order to reduce the energy consumption of wireless networks. In this article, we analyze the impact of hyperparameters on the energy consumption and performance of machine learning algorithms used for cell traffic prediction. For each hyperparameter (number of layers, number of neurons per layer, optimizer algorithm, batch size, and dropout) we identified a set of feasible values. Then, for each combination of hyperparameters, we trained our model and analyzed energy consumption and the resulting performance. The results from this study reveal a great correlation between hyperparameters and energy consumption, confirming the paramount importance of selecting optimal hyperparameters. A tradeoff between the minimization of energy consumption and the maximization of machine learning performance is suggested. © 2023 by the authors."

The analysis describes concepts of the methodology and demonstrates its functionality in the context of carbon footprint assessment of methanol production.; Methods: The methodology proposed assumed unit operations are composed of macroscopic components, six structural including steel, concrete, insulation (glass wool), aluminum, powering, and electronic, and one functional, catalyst. Unit operations included heat exchangers (shell-and-tube and air-cooled systems), separation units (flash tanks and distillation column), and a methanol reactor. Sets of equations were provided to estimate the lifecycle inventory (LCI), while relying on scaling parameters as reported in techno-economic assessment techniques (i.e., surface area to estimate heat exchangers costs). A Power-to-X case study (system boundary) was selected to demonstrate the methodology functionality to build the equipment LCI to estimate the CO2 equivalent emissions to produce 1.0 kg of methanol at 25 °C and 1 atm (functional unit).; Conclusion: This study described a novel methodology to estimate the LCI and subsequent CF of capital goods. This new methodology has been used in a specific case study for methanol production using PtX. Ultimately, the authors of this study seek to create the basis of a simple but comprehensive methodology to reduce data gaps associated to lifecycle inventory and assessment of industrial equipment in literature.; Results and discussion: The case study showed emissions associated to capital goods amounted to 4146 tonnes of CO2 equivalent, with the methanol reactor having the largest share (67.9%), followed by heat exchangers (23.5%) and separation units (8.6%). Regarding components, steel and concrete comprised the largest contribution for most unit operations (> 53.8% of emissions) excluding the methanol reactor (9.9%). The share of powering and electronics was relevant in the carbon footprint (CF) exercise due to the components intrinsic CF (5.74 and 36.25 kg-CO2 eq./kg-component, respectively) when compared to other major components (i.e., steel, 0.58 kg-CO2eq./kg-component). The component catalyst had a significant impact on the reactor emissions (80.7%) which originated from the need of being renewed every 2.5-year period.

With growing social demands for environmental practices, evaluating the feasibility and environmental impact of low-cost treatment systems for small residential areas is essential. Methods: To address this challenge, this study was conducted to evaluate 10 NWTSs seasonally in rural areas of Bursa, Turkey. Authorities over the facilities permitted the examination of workable, low-cost effluent management options. Also, using Open-LCA software based on ReCiPe MidPoint (H) version 1.67, these plants’ effects on global warming, Phosphorus-depletion, human toxicity, marine eutrophication, and freshwater eutrophication were examined. Results: According to the LCA findings, Deydinler NWTS had a greater impact across all three effect areas (freshwater eutrophication, marine eutrophication, and human toxicity), ranging from 11 to 41%. Pinar and Yenice facilities, however, had 26% and 27% larger impacts in the same two impacts (marine eutrophication and human toxicity). These systems performed on average at 67%, 50%, and 58% chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) elimination, respectively. Conclusion: According to the findings, 10 NWTSs have a treatment efficiency of about 70%. NWTSs are possibilities for decentralized wastewater treatment in small residential areas that are both cost-effective and environmentally favorable. By treating organic pollution naturally, without chemicals, and with minimal energy use, they lessen their negative environmental effects. The main findings of this study will be useful for academics in determining future research areas and identifying whom they might consult to help design carbon footprint of NWTS and future carbon reduction objectives. © 2023 The Author(s).

However, the energy consumption of HVACs contributes significantly towards overall energy usage of a building and carbon footprint. To address this challenge, this research proposes the development of a predictive model for HVAC temperature forecasting using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to optimize energy efficiency while maintaining thermal comfort in buildings. The study focuses on comparing the performance of Transformer Neural Networks and CNN-LSTM, a seq2seq model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) on multiple forecasting horizons using data obtained from multiple devices deployed in a room verified by feedback survey forms filled by occupants. The transformer model outperformed, achieving an R2 score of 0.936 at a 1-minute forecasting horizon, surpassing the performance of CNN-LSTM model at all tested forecasting horizons. The transformer model yielded significant energy savings thereby reducing energy consumption by almost 50 % compared to the non-AI conventional methods, particularly at forecasting horizons of 1 min and 60 min, while the occupant survey also favoured a 60-minute forecasting horizon. The performance of transformer model particularly with a 60-minute forecasting horizon underscores its potential to optimize energy efficiency while ensuring thermal comfort in building energy management systems. © 2023 International Energy Initiative"

Reducing the carbon footprint (CF) and water footprint (WF) of crop production can help to mitigate the environmental hazards that stem from GHG emissions and water scarcity. The CFs and WFs of three major cereal crops, rice, wheat, and maize, were estimated for the year 2014 under the environmental conditions in India, based on national statistics and other data sources. Total CFs (TCFs) of rice, wheat, and maize in India were estimated to be 2.44, 1.27, and 0.80 t CO2 equivalent ha−1, respectively, and product WFs for rice, wheat, and maize in India were 3.52, 1.59, and 2.06 m3 kg−1, respectively. Blue WF was found to be the highest in West India for rice and in South India for both wheat and maize, with the highest irrigation water use in these regions. There was a positive correlation between TCF and total WF, and hence mitigation of both was possibly simultaneous in various regions in India. Potential measures for mitigating GHG emissions and optimizing water use for rice, wheat, and maize production in India are recommended in this paper. © 2023 Soil Science Society of China"

At the same time, the healthcare sector contributes to carbon emissions. In Australia, healthcare contributes 7% of the country’s carbon footprint. Research into the environmental impact and mitigation of carbon emissions in primary care is an emerging area. Objective: To explore staff perspectives on facilitators and barriers to environmental sustainability in 3 Australian general practices seeking to reduce their environmental impact. Methods: We used a qualitative, case-study approach, conducting 23 semistructured interviews with staff across the 3 practices including nurses, administrative staff, and doctors. Observation of systems and staff behaviour relating to environmental sustainability was undertaken at 1 practice. Thematic analysis was conducted to determine themes relating to factors influencing the implementation of environmentally sustainable initiatives within practice settings. Results: Climate mitigation efforts raised by participants were largely focussed on energy and waste reduction, rather than prescribing pharmaceuticals and staff and patient transport. Three main factors influencing change towards sustainable practice were identified: “Leadership,” “Staff Engagement and Workplace Culture,” and “Concomitant Benefits.” A leadership team and workplace culture that valued environmental sustainability were found to be important facilitators, as were concomitant benefits, in particular financial savings. Barriers included what interviewees described as a lack of knowledge about initiatives with the highest impact, lack of understanding described by staff of the evidence behind particular initiatives, waning staff engagement and infection control concerns. Conclusions: Our research highlights several important factors that contribute to the implementation of intended environmentally sustainable initiatives in these 3 practices. Further education, research and high-level policy guidance on the potential environmental impact of prescribing pharmaceuticals, staff and patient transport and unnecessary tests and treatments are recommended to further promote environmental sustainability in primary care. © The Author(s) 2023.

However, the advent of industrialization has fundamentally transformed the reality of society, leading to a significant shift towards the mechanization of processes. Despite this, animal traction continues to play an important role as a workforce in many developing countries and developed nations, where there is a renewed interest in the use of animal traction, particularly for tasks intended to have a reduced environmental impact and a smaller carbon footprint. The present study conducted a SWOT analysis to examine the potential of animal traction as an alternative for the recovery processes of forest residual woody biomass, particularly when the use of mechanical equipment is not feasible. This can contribute to the creation of value chains for residual products, which can be harnessed for energy recovery. The utilization of modern animal traction can promote the sustainable development of projects at the local and regional level, with efficient utilization of endogenous resources and the creation of value for residual forest woody biomass. This approach can thus facilitate the optimization of supply chains, from biomass to energy. © 2023 by the authors."

The carbon emissions associated with CS have not been previously quantified. Objective: To estimate the annual carbon emissions generated by travel to CS Testing Centers (CSTCs) and to explore differences across geographic regions. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional, observational study by geocoding medical schools and CSTCs to calculate the distance between them. We obtained data from the 2017 matriculant databases of the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM). The independent variable was the location as defined by USMLE geographic regions. The dependent variables were distance traveled to CSTCs and estimated carbon emissions in metric tons CO2 (mtCO2) calculated using three models. In model 1 all students used single occupancy vehicles; in model 2, all carpooled; and in model 3, half traveled by train and half by single occupancy vehicle. Results: Our analysis included 197 medical schools. The mean out-of-town travel distance was 280.67 miles (IQR: 97.49-383.42). The mtCO2 associated with travel was 2,807.46 for model 1; 3,135.55 for model 2; and 635.34 for model 3. The Western region traveled the farthest, while the Northeast traveled significantly less than other regions. Conclusion: The annual estimated carbon emissions from travel to CSTCs was approximately 3,000 mtCO2. Northeastern students traveled the shortest distances; the average US medical student expended 0.13 mtCO2.

The solar models are investigated using local meteorological data, including direct, diffused and global irradiance. The meteorological data are obtained using local typical meteorological data set collected from a ground weather station. The PVsyst simulation tool is used to model a grid-connected solar PV system utilizing three photovoltaic (PV) technologies: thin-film, monocrystalline, and polycrystalline. Three scenarios were considered: restricted area, daily water production and design capacity. The optimum configuration for the restricted area scenario at the seawater DP location considered is an on-grid thin-film module (170 W) with a tilt angle of 20° and an inverter unit of 2000 kW. The solution module area is 15,248 m2. The annual electricity production will be approximately 4251.1 MWh/y, which represents only 3.1% of the DP demand. Thin-films produce higher annual electricity than monocrystalline and polycrystalline silicon by 8.3% and 5.9%, respectively, but require 15.9% and 5.7% more space than monocrystalline and polycrystalline silicon, respectively. For Shuwaikh DP, a 30 MIGD DP will require a PV system with a capacity of 120 MWp at 30° tilt angles and 60 inverters. The design environmental impact was assessed using life cycle assessment (LCA). The carbon footprint will decrease from 7.3 x10-5 to 1.8 x10-5 (kg CO2 equivalent), for the 30 MIGD production. The fossil fuel depletion will decrease by approximately 80%. However, the large number of solar panels and the significant total ground area required for the 30 MIGD. The solar array of 1,531,054 m2 will adversely affect the urban land occupation impact category by 84% and will increase metal depletion by 37%.

It requires stabilization to enhance its engineering properties before it is transformed into a viable construction material. The use of geopolymers as stabilizer materials for weak soils has been on the rise recently due to their low carbon footprint compared to the use of conventional stabilizer materials like cement. Geopolymerization occurs as a result of the alkali activation of aluminosilicate materials. In this study, peat soil and the aluminosilicate materials Palm Oil Fuel Ash (POFA) and Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBFS) are characterized to assess their suitability as geopolymer precursor materials. A series of laboratory studies were carried out to determine the physicochemical properties of the materials, such as particle size distribution, moisture and organic content, specific gravity, pH, and electrical conductivity. Furthermore, the XRD, XRF, and FESEM tests were carried out to ascertain the mineral characteristics, elemental chemical composition, and morphological characteristics of these materials, respectively. The peat soil is classified as hemic peat with sufficient aluminosilicate content (Si/Al ratio of 2.11). The POFA is identified as Class F pozzolan with adequate Si+Al+Fe oxide content (67.9%), as stipulated by ASTM C618. The GGBFS material was found to be appropriate for geopolymer production, with a Si/Al ratio of 2.17, a hydration modulus of 2.38 (good hydration), and a basicity coefficient of 1.32 (alkaline material favorable for geopolymerization). Based on the geopolymer precursor material suitability assessment criteria, all the materials assessed were deemed suitable for geopolymerization, and the effectiveness of POFA-GGBFS geopolymer to improve peat soil properties should be studied in depth. At present, there are limited studies pertaining to the use of alkali-activated POFA-GGBFS blends to improve peat soil properties. As a result of this material characterization phase, planned works involving the compressive strength testing program on alkali-activated POFA-GGBFS-peat soil blends at ambient temperature will be carried out in the near future. The eventual aim of this research is to remediate the peat soil to be repurposed as road subgrade material. © Authors retain all copyrights."

Currently, countries around the world are setting emission reduction targets or are already involved in carbon–neutral actions, with technological innovation becoming the key to global emission reduction. Therefore, a systematic review of the literature related to technology innovation and emission reduction in response to carbon–neutral actions for climate change is conducted. A global bibliometric visualization analysis is presented using CiteSpace and VOSviewer software. This study visualizes the basic relationship between global emission reduction and technology-related literature under the carbon neutrality target and analyzes and discusses the spatial distribution and hotspot trends of the co-author network and knowledge base. The results show that (1) the trend of the number of relevant studies can be divided into two phases before and after, and starts to increase gradually after 2020. (2) The structural relationship of the author- and institution-based cooperative networks is relatively loose, and the main cooperative networks, mainly by countries, are initially formed by the key contributions of developed and emerging economies. (3) Relevant research hotspots are reflected in multiple perspectives such as investment, management, and policy, in addition to emission reduction targets and technological innovation itself. The causal relationship between relevant research and economic and political dimensions has become an important driving factor for research development. Especially in the paradigm shift phase, there are research characteristics of human intervention and specific actions. (4) In terms of future trends, research involving policy management, methodological efficiency, and systemic models will become important research paths in the future by matching the supply of actions to real needs. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

The main source of fuel was sunflower husk, which can be used in pellet production by the following means: the firing and utilization of fume laden gas as a heat carrier during drying of blend materials and the gasification and utilization of syngas as the fuel in order to heat the indurating machines while thermally treating the pellets. Mathematical simulation was adopted as the research methodology. The results reveal that using biofuel to heat indurating machines during the pelletizing process is technologically feasible. However, there are numerous constraints that are mainly related to environmental issues and logistics. In the course of firing, husk generates additional solid waste and sulfur oxide, although, from the perspective of ESG statistics, it leads to a reduction in the carbon footprint of the end products. Issues related to the handling and storage of biofuel are caused by its aggregate state (solid), low bulk weight, and relatively low calorific value.

However, significant challenges exist in assessment of CO2 footprint and water-rock interactions, due to complex geochemical processes. Herein this study conducts a three-dimensional, multicomponent reactive transport model (RTM) of a field-scale CO2 and O2 ISL process at a typical sandstone-hosted uranium deposit in Songliao Basin, China. Numerical simulations are performed to provide new insight into quantitative interpretation of the greenhouse gas (CO2) footprint and environmental impact (SO42–) of the CO2 and O2 ISL, considering the potential chemical reaction network for uranium recovery at the field scale. RTM results demonstrate that the fate of the CO2 could be summarized as injected CO2 dissolution, dissolved CO2 mineralization and storage of CO2 as a gas phase during the CO2 and O2 ISL process. Furthermore, compared to acid ISL, CO2 and O2 ISL has a potentially smaller environmental footprint, with 20% of SO42– concentration in the aquifer. The findings improve our fundamental understanding of carbon utilization in a long-term CO2 and O2 ISL system and provide important environmental implications when considering complex geochemical processes. © 2023 Geological Society of China."

The combination of dynamic covalent bonds and widely available, biodegradable, and biobased raw materials enables new polymers with an excellent carbon footprint, mechanical properties, and outstanding features in terms of multiple recycling methods, e.g., thermomechanical, chemical, and biological reprocessing/reusability. Natural corn starch granules have been surface-modified by an acetoacetylation reaction without using any additional solvent and maintaining the inner semicrystalline structure, giving a polyfunctional cross-linker for starch-reinforced vitrimer composites. Vinylogous urethane vitrimer matrices were synthesized by the condensation reaction of fully acetoacetylated glycerol and different diamines, while glycerol and the diamines were deliberately selected as potentially biobased raw materials. Seven different matrix vitrimers were synthesized with a content of 0-70 wt % of modified starch and investigated in terms of their thermal and mechanical properties. In total, 20 elastomeric and thermosetting materials have been prepared, exhibiting high elastic moduli of 2 GPa with short stress relaxation times and a high content of modified starch up to 70 wt %. The composites show low swelling ratios, suppressing the natural gelatinization of starch in water. Moreover, suitable thermomechanical, chemical, and enzymatic recycling methods for closed-loop cycles, remolding, reusability, and biodegradability were developed. © 2023 The Authors.

However, the integrated optimization of the blending process involving different coal ranks and biomass synergizing has yet to be achieved in order to meet the quality requirements of a number of CFPPs. This study offers an optimization approach for synergizing blending biomass in several coal-fired power plants (CFPPs). The objective is to reduce fuel costs and carbon dioxide emissions by taking into account CFPP's fuel quality requirements as well as constraints on CFPP demand, source supply capacity, and transportation alternatives. The optimization model used is mixed integer linear programming (MILP), which leverages OR-Tools in Google Colab to provide optimal solutions for the allocation of coal and biomass, whereas in the mathematical model, the amount of biomass that can be mixed into coal is limited in the range of 5% to 10%. Case studies conducted on 17 sources of coal, 1 biomass production facility, 3 alternative transportation capacities, and 4 CFPPs show that blending biomass with coal can reduce fuel costs by 2.77% and carbon dioxide emissions by 9.99% when compared to business as usual. This model offers a practical solution to reduce costs while simultaneously tackling climate change in accordance with the objectives outlined in the Paris Agreement. © 2023 Qazvin Islamic Azad University.

As lifestyles improve and the world population grows, so does the amount of transportation necessary to support this lifestyle. Despite our noble quest to adopt more sustainable transportation, and despite countless innovations and improvements, the results are inadequate; carbon reduction is insufficient to curtail our growth trajectory, much less achieve the aggressive zero emission targets set by companies and governments. To examine this problem, we revisit transportation as a derived demand, a principle which has been accepted for decades, but largely forgotten in sustainable transportation research. In fact, transportation has evolved so much that some scholars are debating the significance of this age-old assumption. This suggests that transportation researchers take a fresh look at the nature, changes, and evolving trends of transportation demand and possibly focus less on sustainable transport and more on adjusting the demand for sustainable transportation. © 2023 American Society of Transportation and Logistics, Inc..

The assessment and proper use of energy in agricultural systems is important to achieve economic benefits and overall sustainability. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the energy balance of crop and livestock production, net energy ratio (NER), and water use efficiency (WUE) of crops of a selected farm in Sri Lanka using the life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. In order to assess the diversification, 18 crops and 5 livestock types were used. The data were obtained from farm records, personal contacts, and previously published literature. Accordingly, the energy balance in crop production and livestock production was −316.87 GJ ha−1 Year−1 and 758.73 GJ Year−1, respectively. The energy related WUE of crop production was 31.35 MJ m−3. The total energy balance of the farm was 736.2 GJ Year−1. The results show a negative energy balance in crop production indicating an efficient production system, while a comparatively higher energy loss was shown from the livestock sector. The procedure followed in this study can be used to assess the energy balance of diversified agricultural systems, which is important for agricultural sustainability. This can be further developed to assess the carbon footprint in agricultural systems. © 2023 by the authors."

For this purpose, annual data of 10 countries with the highest ecological footprint (China, the USA, India, Japan, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Korea, Turkey, and the UK) for the period 1992–2017 is used. The Westerlund and Edgerton (2007) Panel LM bootstrap test results reveal that there is cointegration between the variables. Additionally, the results obtained from the Common Correlated Effects (CCE) coefficient estimator show that financial development, economic growth, and non-renewable energy consumption negatively affect environmental quality by increasing ecological footprint. On other hand, the effect of trade openness on ecological footprint is found to be statistically insignificant. In addition, according to the panel causality test results, a unidirectional causality from financial development to ecological footprint is found while bidirectional causality between economic growth and ecological footprint exists. Therefore, it would be beneficial for policymakers in such countries to direct financial resources to green energy production and consumption and to encourage projects and practices. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

The model aims to support policymakers in estimating the potential impact of various decisions regarding transportation technology and infrastructure. It accounts for energy demand, technological advancements, and infrastructure upgrades as they relate to each transportation market: passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles, aircraft, watercraft, and trains. A technology roadmap underlies this model, outlining anticipated advancements in batteries, hydrogen storage, biofuels, renewable grid electricity, and carbon capture and sequestration. By estimating the demand and the technologies that comprise each transportation market, the model estimates carbon emissions. Results indicate that based on the technology roadmap, carbon neutrality can be achieved by 2070 for the transportation sector. Furthermore, the model found that carbon neutrality can still be achieved with slippage in the technology development schedule; however, delays in infrastructure updates will delay carbon neutrality, while resulting in a substantial increase in the cumulative carbon footprint of the transportation sector. © 2023 by the authors."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the carbon footprint of products used within five common operations, and to identify the biggest contributors (hotspots). Design: A predominantly process-based carbon footprint analysis was conducted for products used in the five highest volume surgical operations performed in the National Health System in England. Setting: The carbon footprint inventory was based on direct observation of 6–10 operations/type, conducted across three sites within one NHS Foundation Trust in England. Participants: Patients undergoing primary elective carpal tunnel decompression, inguinal hernia repair, knee arthroplasty, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, tonsillectomy (March 2019 – January 2020). Main outcome measures: We determined the carbon footprint of the products used in each of the five operations, alongside greatest contributors through analysis of individual products and of underpinning processes. Results: The mean average carbon footprint of products used for carpal tunnel decompression was 12.0 kg CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalents); 11.7 kg CO2e for inguinal hernia repair; 85.5 kg CO2e for knee arthroplasty; 20.3 kg CO2e for laparoscopic cholecystectomy; and 7.5 kg CO2e for tonsillectomy. Across the five operations, 23% of product types were responsible for ≥80% of the operation carbon footprint. Products with greatest carbon contribution for each operation type were the single-use hand drape (carpal tunnel decompression), single-use surgical gown (inguinal hernia repair), bone cement mix (knee arthroplasty), single-use clip applier (laparoscopic cholecystectomy) and single-use table drape (tonsillectomy). Mean average contribution from production of single-use items was 54%, decontamination of reusables 20%, waste disposal of single-use items 8%, production of packaging for single-use items 6% and linen laundering 6%. Conclusions: Change in practice and policy should be targeted towards those products making greatest contribution, and should include reducing single-use items and switching to reusables, alongside optimising processes for decontamination and waste disposal, modelled to reduce carbon footprint of these operations by 23%–42%. © 2023, The Royal Society of Medicine."

The switch to bio-oils enabled by MGTs reduces not only carbon footprints but also operating expenses due to high transportation costs of fossil fuels. However, MGT efficiencies are greatly reduced at partial loads. This work investigates the feasibility of addressing MGT efficiency drops at partial loads by incorporating MGT with a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) to form a hybrid system so that the MGT can be operated at near full power at all times for better efficiencies. In this study, a daily power demand profile of a typical Canadian household is adopted for optimizing battery size and MGT operating strategies. By optimizing MGT daily start time and the engine's threshold partial load factor, the specific fuel consumption and battery size can be minimized for a specific number of households on a micro-grid supported by the MGT-based hybrid power system. © The Author(s) 2022."

For the Materials pillar, two scores were computed from a streamlined calculation of resource (CEENE) and carbon footprints (IPCC) while for the Functionality and Post-Usage pillars, scores were computed from Yes/No answers provided by the users. A fourth pillar considers the potential risk of long-term environmental pollution. Then, the packaging options for the same food are ranked according to the Borda voting rule, considering the individual rankings obtained for the various pillars. The proposed methodology was applied to three commercial (milk and sugar) and non-commercial (strawberry) packaging case studies. The obtained ranking is discussed with respect to current knowledge in the field. The provided methodology is easy to understand, science based, and combines quantitative and qualitative assessments. The developed tool could be handled by non-experts in environmental sciences such as food manufacturers, packaging converters and policy makers. The resulting indicators provide answers to user concerns regarding the environmental impacts of food packaging and guide their choice of the most sustainable option. The proposed scoring method considers the functionality of the packaging with respect to preserving food and reducing food waste, which is rarely considered in packaging environmental assessments. © 2023 The Authors.

The system, defined as Dovetail with SPrings (Dove-SP), utilizes the attractive properties of timber to store CO2, thus reducing the carbon footprint of the existing energy dissipation systems: It comprises two timber slabs that are designed to slide against each other in a motion that is restrained by a dovetail sliding joint. Two sliding interfaces that allow this sliding motion at an attractively low friction coefficient are experimentally investigated: A PVC sand-wich (PVC-s) sliding interface, comprising a thin layer of sand that is sand-wiched between two PVC layers and a timber sand-wich sliding interface consisting of a thin layer of sand encapsulated between two beech timber surfaces. A set of low-cost steel springs is designed and installed on both sides of the dovetail joint to recenter the structure back to its original position after the end of an earthquake ground motion excitation. A novel, low-cost and deformable wood material fabricated from delignified balsa wood is used to reduce the pounding effects before the activation of the steel springs. The seismic behavior and the recentering ability of the novel timber-based energy dissipation system subjected to an ensemble of recorded earthquake ground motion excitations was experimentally investigated through a large-scale shaking table investigation at ETH Zurich. © 2022, The Author(s)."
1283,Impact of partial encapsulation on the fire dynamics of an open-plan compartment with exposed timber ceiling and columns: CodeRed #04,Article,Kotsovinos P.; Christensen E.G.; Glew A.; O'Loughlin E.; Mitchell H.; Amin R.; Robert F.; Heidari M.; Barber D.; Rein G.; Schulz J.,Fire and Materials,47.0,2023,597,626,10.1002/fam.3112,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146919833&doi=10.1002%2ffam.3112&partnerID=40&md5=814d453a5e4530d8af4783a9e3b6b10c,03080501,Scopus,CLT ceiling; encapsulation; fire dynamics; mass timber,"The use of mass timber in construction is becoming a compelling option when faced with the high carbon footprint of traditional concrete and steel production. However, fire safety standards are yet to evolve to support these designs. Encapsulation is commonly used to protect all, or some, of the timber surfaces and reduce the risks introduced. This paper presents the results from CodeRed #04, the final experiment of the CodeRed experimental campaign. This experiment was carried out inside a purpose-built facility to capture fire dynamics in large compartments with exposed timber. CodeRed #04 had identical characteristics to CodeRed #01 with the exception that ~50% of the cross-laminated timber (CLT) ceiling was encapsulated. The experiments were intentionally similar to the traveling fire experiments, x-ONE and x-TWO, which had a non-combustible ceiling to enable a direct comparison. The overall fire dynamics experienced in CodeRed #04, intersect the characteristics observed in CodeRed #01 and x-ONE and x-TWO.1. In CodeRed #04, there was a delay in the ignition of the CLT ceiling as the CLT directly above the crib was encapsulated. Once the CLT ceiling ignited, the fire spread rapidly throughout the compartment. The peak heat release rate (HRR) was estimated to be approximately 100 MW, a 17% decrease from CodeRed #01. Following CLT ignition the resulting fire duration, maximum temperatures, and heat fluxes were broadly similar to CodeRed #01. Flame heights of approximately 1.5 m were observed from the windows while flame heights of 2.5–3 m were observed in CodeRed #01. Therefore, flame heights were found to be comparable to x-TWO.1, though over a greater number of windows, reflecting the greater extent of simultaneous burning within the compartment. The average charring depth of the exposed CLT panels was ~25 mm, which is similar to that measured in CodeRed #01-suggesting that the fire severity near the ceiling was not strongly impacted by the 50% encapsulation of timber. No charring was observed where the ceiling was encapsulated and loaded service fixings installed through the encapsulation were found to be less likely to fail than when attached directly to the exposed timber. Smoldering was observed after the cessation of flaming and, in a few locations, was observed to progress through the thickness of the CLT panel and continue behind the encapsulation. This illustrates that, while encapsulation can succcessfully prevent flaming, it cannot be completely relied on to avoid smouldering. The findings from CodeRed #04 contribute to the development of evidence-based fire safety design methodologies for exposed mass timber buildings. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

In this context, and based on the use of modern technologies, an enormous volume of highway data is generated daily. These data can be utilized to extract and evaluate indicators to analyze highway green performance. Feedback from indicators allows to grasp the sustainable practices and implement corrective actions. Dashboards have become popular in recent years as uniquely powerful tools for communicating important information. This research adopted the approach of centralized data provider to develop a web-based visualization dashboard, as a technique to reinforce decisions in the highway sector. The dashboard will be employed to gain information about highway green performance with the goal of enhancing decisions. In this dashboard, data integration of MyGHI and CFC has been used in illustrating the visualization. The development utilized a web-based system, using HTML and CSS to build up basic static UI; use JavaScript to archive the processing data dynamically; use PHP to control models’ logical function and MySQL database. The quantitative and qualitative measures were used to validate the dashboard. Findings demonstrated an increase in accuracy of data monitoring and quicker decision-making using the Dashboard. © 2023 University of Kuwait. All rights reserved."

Meanwhile, the transport sector has emerged as one of the most emissions-intensive industrial sectors. Thus, this study is the first to investigate how Pakistan’s transport infrastructure across four modes—roads, trains, ports, and airways—affects industrial value addition and carbon footprints in the country. By making use of the theoretical and empirical literature, the study builds carbon emission and economic output models to determine the economic and environmental sustainability of transport infrastructure development in the country. The empirical findings conclude long-term environmental sustainability issues in transportation infrastructure development. All means of transport infrastructure development have a significant positive impact on carbon dioxide emissions in the country. Only ports and highways, however, provide a positive contribution to industrial output. Additionally, population growth, capital, labor, and urbanization are positively linked with the industrial output and carbon dioxide emission in the country, whereas trade openness helps to offset the emission intensity to some extent. Given this evidence, we provide detailed policy implications by highlighting the significance of greener technologies under new transport-related infrastructure investment that addresses SDG-9. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

It is necessary to establish the life cycle assessment (LCA) to assess the environmental impacts of various treatment technologies comprehensively, thus provide support for sorting, recycling, treatment and disposal strategies of FW. In this study, a local FW treatment plant in Shanghai, using typically aerobic anaerobic combination treatment technology was selected to analyze the environmental impacts with LCA. The process mainly included pretreatment, power, aerobic composting, anaerobic digestion, and further process systems. LCA results showed that the environmental impacts mainly came from the power and aerobic composting systems on the fine particulate matter formation and eutrophication, and freshwater ecotoxicity and terrestrial acidification, respectively. Considering the carbon footprint, the aerobic composting system contributed 3.61E + 02 kg CO2 eq and represented the largest source of carbon emission. The soil conditioner yielded both environmental benefits on eutrophication and terrestrial ecotoxicity, and ecological benefits of 75.33 million CNY per year being the major revenue for the treatment plant. It also suggested that the biogas generation capacity of anaerobic digestion could be increased to achieve electricity self-sufficiency, thus save about 7.12 million CNY per year in electricity costs, and avoid corresponding environmental impacts caused by coal-fired. In summary, the aerobic anaerobic combination treatment could be further optimized and applied in FW treatment to reduce the environmental impacts, and enhance resource recovery and secondary pollution control. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

The environmental impact of this transition in gastroenterology (GI) combined with user experience has not been studied. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent telemedicine visits (telephone and video) at a GI clinic at West Virginia University. Distance of patients' residence from clinic × 2 was calculated, and Environmental Protection Agency calculators utilized to calculate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that were avoided from tele-visits. Patients were reached by telephone and were asked questions to fill in a validated Telehealth Usability Questionnaire with Likert scales (1–7). Variables were also collected via chart review. Results: A total of 81 video and 89 telephone visits were conducted for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) between March 2020 and March 2021. A total of 111 patients were enrolled, with a response rate of 65.29%. Mean age was lower in the video visit cohort compared with the telephone visit cohort (43.45 ± 14.32 years vs 52.34 ± 17.46 years). Most patients had medications prescribed during the visit (79.3%), and a majority had laboratory testing orders placed (57.7%). We calculated a total distance of 8732 miles that the patients would have traveled if they were to present for in-person visits (including return trips). A total of 393.3 gallons of gasoline would have been required to transport these patients to and from the healthcare facility to their residence. A total of 3.5 metric tons of GHG's were saved by avoiding 393.3 gallons of gasoline for travel. In relatable terms, this is equivalent to burning more than 3500 pounds of coal. This averages to 31.5-kg GHG emissions and 3.54 gallons of gasoline saved per patient. Conclusion: Telemedicine for GERD resulted in significant environmental savings and was rated highly for access, satisfaction, and usability by patients. Telemedicine for GERD can be an excellent alternative to in-person visits. © 2023 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd."

We contribute to the incomplete understanding of tourism emissions pandemic impact and in different post-covid recovery scenarios. Using official data on tourists' consumption, we calculate the carbon footprint of tourism in Spain in 2019 and 2020 under different recovery pathways, including changes in consumption patterns and emissions efficiency, using a multiregional input-output model. Results show that the carbon footprint of tourism in Spain fell by 63% in 2020 compared to pre-pandemic levels, which would be aligned with the current sectoral decarbonisation target. However, the new tourists’ consumption patterns resulting from the pandemic are insufficient to increase tourism sustainability if they imply pre-pandemic consumption levels. The results provide empirical ground for the binary debate on “recovery or reform”. © 2023"

However, it has also raised concerns about its effect on the environment. This study explores the impact of productive capacities and green investment in mitigating the ecological footprint of BRI countries. The role of productive capacities on ecological footprint is very little discussed in earlier studies. This study investigates the effect of productive capacities index and green investment on ecological footprint for 42 BRI participating countries covering the time span of 2000-2018. Different methods are applied to tackle the problem of dependence of cross sections; then Lagrange multiplier bootstrap method is applied to find co-integration. The long run relationship is uncovered by “augmented mean group” (AMG) and “common correlated effects mean group” (CCEMG). The findings of the study show that both productive capacities and green investment have a significant negative impact on ecological footprint, depicting that promoting sustainable development and environmental protection is feasible through increasing productive capacities and investing in green technologies. The findings of this study have important implications for policymakers, who should focus on promoting sustainable environment by prioritizing productive capacities and green technologies. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

This study explored suitable locations for onshore wind turbines, and estimated the wind power potential in Fujian Province, China. We also analyzed the resource occupancy of 100 years of potential wind turbine operation in terms of the materials, CO2 emissions, land, and labor. This was done using the sustainability indicator – resources time footprint (RTF). RTF measures the ratio of the occupancy of the resource within a period of time to the total capacity to provide a product or service. This is done using a time dimension (years). A higher RTF value indicates a larger environmental and social impact. Fujian Province has an annual wind power potential of 50,638 GWh, which is mainly clustered around its coastal regions. The RTF of steel is the largest in the material aspect, which is 1.2 times that of copper and 23.9 times that of aluminum. Negative values of the RTF of CO2 and land show that wind power is conducive to CO2 emission reduction and the prevention of future land occupancy. Furthermore, the construction and operation of wind turbines will not impose a burden on the labor force. The RTF values of the wind turbines decreased with an increase in the annual average wind speed. By modifying the parameters, this methodology can be applied to determine ideal locations in other regions, which present the highest environmental benefits, for future wind turbine installations. © 2023 The Author(s)"

Systems thinking competency also enables us to focus more on large-scale climate change mitigation actions. Previous surveys indicated that Finns have changed their behavior for mitigating climate change, but this has been not reflected in decreased consumption-based calculated carbon footprints because large-scale mitigation measures have not materialized. The present study assessed Finns' systems thinking competency (n = 2006) and knowledge of how to reduce their household carbon footprint. The survey data collected were analyzed using explorative factor analysis, hierarchical regression analysis, t-test, and analysis of variance. The results indicate that Finns view their own systems thinking competency related to climate change as not very high, and heir assessments vary widely. Moreover, their knowledge of how to reduce their household carbon footprint is somewhat low and is geared toward small-scale mitigation actions. The results can be used to inform environmental policy and sustainability education priorities. © 2022 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Increasing use of day-case surgery pathways may help in meeting this target. Objective: To investigate the estimated difference in carbon footprint between day-case and inpatient transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT) surgery in England. Design, setting, and participants: This was a retrospective analysis of administrative data extracted from the Hospital Episode Statistics database for all TURBT procedures conducted in England from April 1, 2013 to March 31, 2022. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Day-case and inpatient TURBT procedures were identified and the carbon footprint for key elements of the surgical pathway was estimated using data from Greener NHS and the Sustainable Healthcare Coalition. Results and limitations: Of 209 269 TURBT procedures identified, 41 583 (20%) were classified as day-case surgery. The day-case rate increased from 13% in 2013–2014 to 31% in 2021–2022. The move from inpatient stays to day-case surgery between 2013–2014 and 2021–2022 demonstrates a trend toward a lower-carbon pathway, with an estimated saving of 2.9 million kg CO2 equivalents (equivalent to powering 2716 homes for 1 yr) in comparison to no change in practice. We calculated that potential carbon savings for the financial year 2021–2022 would be 217 599 kg CO2 equivalents (equivalent to powering 198 homes for 1 yr) if all hospitals in England not already in the upper quartile were able to achieve the current upper-quartile day-case rate. Our study is limited in that estimates are based on carbon factors for generic surgical pathways. Conclusions: Our study highlights potential NHS carbon savings that could be achieved by moving from inpatient stays to day-case surgery. Reducing variation in care across the NHS and encouraging all hospitals to adopt day-case surgeries, where clinically appropriate, would lead to further carbon savings. Patient summary: In this study we estimated the potential for carbon savings if patient undergoing bladder tumour surgery were admitted and discharged on the same day. We estimate that increasing use of day-case surgery between 2013–2014 and 2021–2022 has saved 2.9 million kg CO2 equivalents. If all hospitals were to achieve day case-rates comparable to those in the highest quarter of hospitals in England in 2021–2022, then the carbon equivalent to powering 198 homes for 1 year could have been saved. © 2023 The Authors"

This empirical study has looked at one approach through which environment-friendly production and consumption can be encouraged. The developed model has studied the relationship between retailers’ access to green finance and consumer purchase intention of green products by incorporating the role of environmental, status, and future consciousness. Theoretical foundations for this model have been taken from the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and theory of reasoned action (TRA), which have extensively discussed the role of consciousness and societal norms while making purchase intentions. To gain insights about the purchasing behaviour of consumers, this study collected data from the Jiangsu province of China, where a non-probability convenience sampling technique was used to distribute a questionnaire to 400 respondents between February 2022 and August 2022. The collected data was analysed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) in SmartPLS in order to study the relationship between independent and dependent variables. Results of this study show that retailers’ access to green finance positively impacts consumer purchase intention towards green products, and adding a consciousness perspective in the model strengthens this relationship. Moreover, the theory of planned behaviour and the theory of reasoned action were validated through this study, providing insights for policymakers on the importance of promoting green finance to influence green product purchase intention. Overall, this study shows that policymakers should give green financing to retailers and environmental and future awareness to consumers to encourage environment-friendly behaviour. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

The water (H2O) evaporates and electron- dissociates into OH· radicals. OH· recombines with alkyl radicals, produced via electron dissociation of ethane, to generate the oxygenates that absorb into H2O. A plasma-assisted path, reminiscent of the low-temperature thermocatalytic ethane steam reforming, leads to significant H2coproduction. The gaseous stream also comprises CO2and C2H4. Up to 1.3 and 1 μmol min-1of liquid C2H5OH and CH3OH are attained, respectively. Compared to CO2-assisted ethane plasma conversion, which produces many oxygenates with low selectivity, the carbon selectivity can range from >70% C2H5OH, CH3OH, and CH3COOH to 60% C2H4.

1295,Life cycle assessment of different strawberry production methods in Germany with a particular focus on plastic emissions,Article,Galafton C.; Maga D.; Sonnemann G.; Thonemann N.,International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment,28.0,2023,611,625,10.1007/s11367-023-02167-9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85154581569&doi=10.1007%2fs11367-023-02167-9&partnerID=40&md5=afc18a789ac7642122c1479ed5d914f6,09483349,Scopus,Agriculture; Carbon footprint; Environmental footprint; Greenhouse; Mulching; PEF; Plastic pollution; Plasticulture; Tunnel,"Purpose: Using plastic for strawberry cultivation (so-called plasticulture) is widespread to extend cultivation, reduce weed stress and water and nutrient demand, and protect plants. We assess the environmental impacts of different plasticulture methods, including possible impacts caused by the (accidental) emission of plastics. The goals are to help farmers determine the most environmentally friendly cultivation technique and to test the inclusion of plastic pollution in life cycle assessment (LCA). Methods: An LCA is conducted for a baseline scenario without plasticulture and 11 plasticulture scenarios. The scenarios are modeled using the regionalized ecoinvent 3.8 cut-off database. The functional unit is 1 kg of strawberries of marketable quality at the farm gate produced in the year 2021. The amounts of fertilizer, irrigation, and strawberry output of the scenarios are adapted depending on the plasticulture method based on an extensive literature review. The environmental impacts are assessed using the life cycle impact assessment methods of the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) recommended by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, which is extended to account for plastic-related impacts. The impacts are normalized, weighted, and aggregated, resulting in one single impact score per scenario. Results and discussion: The scenarios using either a combination of conventional mulch film and row cover or biodegradable mulch film have the lowest total impacts; a macro tunnel or greenhouse causes the highest impacts. There seems to be no trade-off between maximizing productivity and lowering environmental impacts: the scenario with the highest yield also has one of the lowest overall impacts. Only direct emissions are considered regarding plastic pollution. Besides, the plastic pollution impact category is currently limited to the persistence of plastic in the environment and is extendable to but is not yet accounting for exposure and effect of plastic emission on humans and ecosystems. Conclusion: Plasticulture can increase the yield and reduce environmental impacts for strawberry cultivation compared to open field cultivation. With the used normalization and weighting factors, plastic pollution makes up a considerable share of the overall environmental impact of strawberry cultivation, supporting the recent efforts of different research groups to include plastic emissions in LCA by developing suitable characterization factors. © 2023, The Author(s)."

The effects of various injection and reactivity phasing strategies on a diesel engine’s combustion characteristics has been evaluated here. However, effect of this combustion characteristics on the corresponding performance and emission has also been evaluated here. This study revealed the ignition delay (ID) and combustion duration (CD) trade-off for almost every combustion phase achieved here during the testing. This analysis also incorporates the widespread effect of combustion characteristics on the performance and emission behavior of the diesel engine for both types of fuel combinations, that is, CNG + BD and Et + BD operation. For example, the lowest ID for CNG enriched combustion was 26.62% greater than ethanol enriched combustion, signifying that the ethanol delayed the start of ignition at polit-main angle of 35°-05° CA. Hence, NHC, PM, and CO2 emissions registered a lower footprint for CNG-BD operation, while ethanol-BD mode reported lower CO emission. However, ethanol-enriched combustion registered a 31.25% higher maximum CD than CNG-coupled operation, signifying a more extended period of energy release. CNG-BD operation also observed lower NHC, CO, and CO2 footprint corresponding to maximum combustion duration, and ethanol-BD mode reported lower PM emission. © IMechE 2022."

Our clinical trials programme, which relied on in-person visits for training, monitoring and capacity building across nine low- and middle-income countries, had to adapt to those unprecedented operational challenges. We report the adaptation of our working model with a focus on the operational areas of training, monitoring and cross-site collaboration. The new working model: Adaptations include changing training strategies from in-person site visits with three or four team members to a multi-pronged virtual approach, with generic online training for good clinical practice, the development of a library of study-specific training videos, and interactive virtual training sessions, including practical laboratory-focused training sessions. We also report changes from in-person monitoring to remote monitoring as well as the development of a more localized network of clinical trial monitors to support hybrid models with in-person and remote monitoring depending on identified risks at each site. We established a virtual network across different trial and study sites with the objective to further build capacity for good clinical practice–compliant antimalarial trials and foster cross-country and cross-study site collaboration. Conclusion: The forced adaptation of these new strategies has come with advantages that we did not envisage initially. This includes improved, more frequent engagement through the established network with opportunities for increased south-to-south support and a substantially reduced carbon footprint and budget savings. Our new approach is challenging for study sites with limited prior experience but this can be overcome with hybrid models. Capacity building for laboratory-based work remains difficult using a virtual environment. The changes to our working model are likely to last, even after the end of the pandemic, providing a more sustainable and equitable approach to our research. © The Author(s) 2023."

It is critical to maintain the services, i.e., data intensive computing, while preserving the greenness in the data center management. However, the more data centers required data replicated in, the faster exponential increase in the services’ carbon footprint. What is worse, the carbon coefficient of the data center is time-dependent as the power source varies from local renewable farms to power grids, making the problem dynamic. To address the challenges above, in this paper, we consider the temporal and spatial characteristics of cross-region data replication and propose a data replication framework (Carbon Aware Geo-diverse DAta Replication) CAGDAR to reduce carbon footprint and maximize service coverage simultaneously. CAGDAR balances the carbon footprint of data centers, i.e., sites, while respecting storage capacity, taking into account the coverage of data copies and the locations. We evaluate CAGDAR with real carbon traces and show that CAGDAR can rationally allocate data replicas in the temporal-spatio domain, reducing the services’ carbon footprint by 26% and improving the service coverage by 33.5%. © 2023 Elsevier B.V."

The SDGs include many broad environmental goals, such as pollution of air, water, and soil, and the protection of natural resources to combat this pollution. To achieve these goals, carbon emissions and ecological footprint analyzes provide some guidance, but neglect the supply side of nature. The load capacity factor makes it possible to analyze biocapacity (the supply side of nature) and ecological footprint simultaneously to assess whether countries are exceeding the sustainability limit and what factors are influencing that limit. To address this issue and provide a comprehensive environmental assessment of OECD countries, this study examines the influence of human capital, income, natural resources, urbanization, and renewable energy on the load capacity factor for 26 OECD countries over the period 1980–2018. For this purpose, the study uses the newly developed quantile common correlated effects mean group (QMG) estimator and investigates the load capacity curve (LCC) hypothesis. Our results suggest that there is a U-shaped link between income and environmental quality and the LCC hypothesis is valid. The QMG estimator results show that human capital, resource rent, and renewable energy improve the load capacity factor, but urbanization adversely affects environmental quality. The overall results highlight the ecological role of renewable energy, resource rent, and human capital in achieving the SDGs of OECD countries, such as transitioning to a low-carbon economy and reducing water pollution. © 2023 International Association for Gondwana Research"

The geometry of the rock-pit has been simplified into a shape that can be extended for any seasonal storage system with a three-dimensional conical geometry. The computational domain has been solved using both linear thermal equilibrium (LTE) and linear thermal non-equilibrium (LTNE) models, and the former has been found to be computationally quick and accurate. The model has predicted a 95% energy saving at the highest flow conditions required in the mine. Further analysis has suggested that the increase in storage capacity by decreasing the porosity of rocks in the rock-pit is insignificant compared to the corresponding increase in fan power. Furthermore, the investigation done on natural rocks has indicated an increased ability to store heat in the rock-pit when rocks with higher thermal mass have been used. The use of RPES has shown a significant potential to reduce the carbon footprint. Finally, an economic analysis done on the system has shown a return on investment of just under 12 years. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC."

As an emerging nanomaterial for environmental applications, its competitive performance and environmentally responsible synthesis are critical to its success. A powerful tool for informing material development with reduced environmental impacts is life cycle assessment (LCA). In this study, LCA is used to evaluate the environmental impacts of g-C3N4 nanosheet produced via eight existing synthesis routes. The results reveal electricity as the main contributor to the cumulative impacts of all eight g-C3N4 syntheses. There are opportunities to reduce energy demand, and consequently the synthesis impacts, by revising synthesis procedures (i.e., removing or reducing time of use of a piece of equipment), optimizing the calcination step (i.e., faster heating rate, lower heating time, lower temperature), and moving to cleaner electricity sources. Further, benchmarking the environmental impacts of g-C3N4 nanosheets to a well-established metal-based photocatalyst, titanium dioxide nanoparticles (nano-TiO2), reveals mixed comparative results. The synthesis method substantially influences the comparative impacts. Considering use-phase benefits of activating g-C3N4 with visible wavelength light emitting diodes compared to ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths for nano-TiO2 results in a 52% energy demand reduction (in kWh). Performance of g-C3N4 compared to a high-energy disinfection approach (i.e., conventional UV) reveals an inability to meet drinking water disinfection standards for viral load reduction (4-log reduction) with any mass of g-C3N4, given its high embodied resource footprint. This work establishes a foundation to inform and direct g-C3N4 nanosheets toward improved sustainable development. © 2023 by the International Society for Industrial Ecology."

This work evaluated the effects of methane and producer gas blends on the performance of a SI engine. The additions of methane were 10%, 25% and 50% on a molar basis. The results demonstrated that adding 25% methane to producer gas is enough to sustain the combustion reaction with good stability and a power derating of 10.8%. The addition of 50% methane to producer gas attains efficiency and combustion characteristics remarkably similar to pure natural gas with a power de-rating of 5.4%. Emissions indicated that carbon monoxide (CO) has decreased with the addition of methane to producer gas from 85 to 3.43 g/kWh, while nitrogen oxides ((Formula presented.)) emissions have increased from 0 to 8.85 g/kWh. In the case of unburned hydrocarbons (UHC), emissions did not considerably change before adding 25% methane to producer gas and stayed constant at approximately 10 g/kWh.

It will also result in increased emissions if proper resource planning is not implemented and unconventional water and energy resources are not exploited. There is a need to assess the potential of these unconventional resources, such as wastewater and sludge in alleviating carbon emissions and water stress. This study aims to do so by assessing the use of treated wastewater and sludge for food production and optimizing their planning using a multi-objective optimization model embedded within an energy-water-food-waste nexus approach applied to a case study on the agricultural sector in the state of Qatar. It is demonstrated that the use of treated sewage effluent as a water resource can supply the fodder farms in Qatar with all their nitrogen fertilization requirements almost throughout the year. Furthermore, the use of both treated sewage effluent and sludge as a source of energy has the potential to reduce the carbon footprint and water stress level by 62 % and 57 %, respectively. It is thus recommended to include treated sewage effluent in the agricultural water budget and to suspend outdoor farming not only during the summer but also in the hot month of March, as the latter can result in an additional 7 % and 30 % reduction of carbon footprint compared to the base-scenario when the water stress level is set to 0 % and 75 %, respectively. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

Under the optimum process conditions, Ni–Cr sinter indices were substantially improved in the pellet-sintering process. Tumble index and productivity were improved by 33.57% and 27.84%, respectively, and solid fuel rate was reduced by 16.02% compared with the base case. CO2 emissions can be annually reduced by 112.62 thousand tons in sinter production for a major Chinese stainless steel enterprise. This was due to that the better heat and mass transfer conditions during pellet-sintering was beneficial to the reduction of sinter porosity and the formation of silico-ferrite of calcium and alumina, which consequently contributed to the generation of Ni–Cr sinter with more compact microstructure at lower solid fuel consumption. Its reduction characteristics were similar to the base case whereas the softening-melting properties were even better. In addition, Fe–Cr–Ni crude alloy formed in the determination process of softening-melting properties possessed the appropriate melting point, which was suitable for blast furnace production. The high-quality Ni–Cr sinter obtained from the low-carbon pellet-sintering process can be used as the qualified burden for Fe–Cr–Ni alloy smelting at lower cost.

This study aims to compare the sevoflurane consumption of 22 anaesthesiologists in a medium sized hospital 4 years after flow-i workstations (Getinge, Sweden) entered into service, in three airway approaches: intubated patients, laryngeal mask ventilation, and mask anaesthesia. Typical sevoflurane consumption for each anaesthesiologist was defined as the mean cumulative consumption in the chronologically first 50 cases meeting the inclusion criteria for each airway group in 2019. The potential savings, if everyone were to adopt the approach of the more economical anaesthesiologists (15th percentile), was calculated. The CO2 equivalent emissions were calculated using a GWP20 of 702 and a GWP100 of 195. The median [range] consumption after 45 min was 10.9 [7.5–18.4] ml in intubated patients and 9.0 [7.4–15.3] ml in patients with laryngeal mask, and 9.9 [3.4–20.9] ml after 8 min with mask ventilation. This corresponds to a double to six fold consumption between the least and most wasteful approach. The typical CO2 equivalent emissions (GWP20) per anaesthesiologist varied between 8.0 and 19.6 kg/45 min in intubated airways, between 7.9 and 16.3 kg/45 min in LMA, and between 3.6 and 22.3 kg/8 min in mask ventilation. Despite using the same workstations in the same hospital, the typical sevoflurane consumption differed dramatically between 22 anaesthesiologists. In addition to providing advanced workstations, proper education is required to achieve the behavior change needed to reduce the pollution and financial waste associated with volatile anaesthetics. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."

Accordingly, alternative blade waste management techniques are being investigated to optimize material recovery. This study evaluates the correlation between the circular economy performance and the carbon footprint of seven end-of-life management solutions for wind turbine blades: repurposing, grinding, solvolysis, pyrolysis, co-processing in cement kilns, incineration with energy recovery and landfilling. The circular economy performance is analyzed through the calculation of the product circularity indicator, while the carbon footprint is determined through life cycle assessment, using the global warming indicator and considering the management of three blades from cradle-to-gate as functional unit. As the performance of solvolysis and pyrolysis recycling is expected to change in the future, a sensitivity analysis is also carried out to evaluate the variability of the results by changing their process efficiency and the quality of the recovered materials. The results indicate that blade recycling through solvolysis is the most circular (0.47–0.77) and low-carbon (225–503 CO2 eq.) solution overall. Blade repurposing, grinding and cement co-processing have a similar circularity (0.52–0.55) and a global warming impact ranging from 499 t CO2 eq. to 615 t CO2 eq. Although the circularity of pyrolysis is 59% (0.35) to 118% (0.48) greater than the circularity of incineration and landfilling (0.22), its carbon footprint can range from 566 t CO2 eq. to 744 t CO2 eq, which could be up to 19% higher than the carbon footprint of these linear EoL management alternatives (623 t CO2). Based on these findings, proposals for sustainable industrial innovation and methodological recommendations for the development of integrated circularity and sustainability studies are proposed. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

Methods that quantify flows of compound and minor element mixtures, rather than non-mixed elemental flows, are needed to prospectively analyze and predict inventory and performance for complex technology life cycles. This study utilizes process simulation to resolve the mass and energy balances needed to rigorously analyze these complexities in circular systems. Using physics-based prospective inventory data, we simultaneously assess the environmental and techno-economic performance of three photovoltaic life cycles and predict the effects of circularity on resource efficiency, carbon footprint, and levelized cost of electricity. One inventory dataset is generated per life cycle to ensure alignment between assessments and to identify trade-offs between environmental and techno-economic performance with respect to circularity, so linking circularity and sustainability. The linked material and energy resource and techno-economic models allow for the impacts of carbon taxation and the moderating effects of circularity to be explored. In addition to the clear environmental benefits of increased circularity, we find that it could dampen the cost impact of taxation. While confirming that perovskite-based modules, single junction or in tandem with silicon, clearly outperform the silicon market standard both techno-economically and environmentally, we show that maximum circularity does not automatically deliver the most sustainable outcome. The approach enables assessment of the combined impacts of specific technological, commercial, and policy choices made by different actors along the photovoltaic value chain.

However, serious issues rooted in large volume change (80%), poor intrinsic conductivity, “shuttle effect” of S cathode, and limited mass loading of traditional electrode still make it a big challenge to achieve high energy density LSBs in a limited footprint. Herein, an innovative carbon dioxide (CO2) assisted three-dimensional (3D) printing strategy is proposed to fabricate three-dimensional lattice structured CO2 activated single-walled carbon nanotubes/S composite thick electrode (3DP S@CNTs-CO2) for high areal capacity LSBs. The 3D lattice structure formed by interwoven CNTs and printed regular macropores can not only act as fast electron transfer networks, ensuring good electronic conductivity of thick electrode, but is beneficial to electrolyte infiltration, effectively boosting ion diffusion kinetics even under a high-mass loading. In addition, the subsequent high-temperature CO2in-situ etching can induce abundant nanopores on the wall of CNTs, which significantly promotes the sulfur loading as well as its full utilization as a result of shortened ion diffusion paths. Owing to these merits, the 3DP S@CNTs-CO2 electrode delivers an impressive mass loading of 10 mg·cm−2. More importantly, a desired attribute of linearly scale up in areal capacitance with increased layers is observed, up to an outstanding value of 5.74 mAh·cm−2, outperforming most reported LSBs that adopt strategies that physically inhibit polysulfides. This work provides a thrilling drive that stimulates the application of LSBs in new generation miniaturized electronic devices.

1309,The impact of natural resource abundance on ecological footprint: evidence from Algeria,Article,Chekouri S.M.; Chibi A.; Benbouziane M.,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,30.0,2023,69289,69306,10.1007/s11356-023-26720-z,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85156107132&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-023-26720-z&partnerID=40&md5=8b164261c3a9794dfd027c98532a9229,09441344,Scopus,Algeria; ARDL; Ecological footprint; Natural resources rents; Quantile-on-quantile regression,"The relationship between natural resources and the ecological footprint is a debate issue and shows inconclusive results. Therefore, the present study attempts to examine the role of natural resource abundance in shaping Algeria’s ecological footprint over the period 1970–2018 using autoregressive distributed lags (ARDL) and quantile-on-quantile regression (QQR). Empirical findings from the ARDL technique suggest that natural resource rents, GDP per capita, gross fixed capital formation, and urbanization increase ecological footprint. The QQR methodology, however, provided more insightful and in-depth findings compared to those of the ARDL. Interestingly, the findings of the QQR uncovered that while the impact of natural resources on ecological footprint is positive and substantial at the middle and upper quantiles, it gets weaker at the lower quantiles. This further implies that the over-extraction of natural resources would generate impacts on environmental degradation, while lesser natural resource extraction appears to be less detrimental to the environment. The QQR also reveals that economic growth, gross fixed capital formation, and urbanization have a positive effect on the ecological footprint in the majority of quantiles, with the exception of the lower quantiles of urbanization, where the effect is negative, indicating that the lowest degree of urbanization improved environmental quality in Algeria. Policymakers in Algeria are urged to pay critical attention to the management of the country’s natural resources, promote renewable energy sources, and develop public awareness to secure environmental sustainability. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

This study calculated the total carbon footprint of the ACT in 2018, including Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and modelled scenarios to reduce all emissions in line with a 1.5 °C target approach. This is the first time a multi-scale analysis of local, sub-national and international supply chains has been undertaken for a city, using a nested and trade-adjusted global multi-region input-output model. This allowed for the quantification of global origins and destinations of emissions, which showed that the 2018 carbon footprint for the ACT was approximately 34.7 t CO2-eq/cap, with 83% attributed to Scope 3. Main contributions came from transport, electricity, manufacturing and public administration and safety, with emissions generated primarily in Australian States and Territories. Modelling in accordance with a 1.5 °C warming scenario showed a plausible reduction to 5.2 t CO2-eq/cap by 2045 (excluding offsets or carbon dioxide removal technologies), with remaining emissions predominantly embodied in international supply chains. This study demonstrates the radical changes required by a wealthy Australian city to achieve 1.5 °C compliance and identifies sectors and supply chains for prioritising policies to best achieve this outcome. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

To address these circumstances, this paper applies a non-cooperative game model to describe the electricity resource distribution and product production process under enterprises’ competitive state, proposing an optimal electricity distribution analysis framework for manufacturing enterprises. The results of optimal electricity distribution for six subindustries in the ‘three innovations’ manufacturing industries (referring to a collection of economic activities to establish new industries, new formats and new business models) are analysed to examine the difference in electricity consumption efficiency among industries. The electricity quota of each industrial chain significantly differs before and after redistribution;therefore, the industrial differences of optimal electricity distribution are further explored from the perspective of industrial chains, revealing the supply–demand relationship of upstream, middle and downstream enterprises. Finally, corresponding policy suggestions and directions for further research are presented. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

This work addresses for the first time the techno-environmental assessment of a CCS process based on the ionic liquid [Bmim][Acetate] for H2 production by steam methane reforming (SMR) and the comparison to conventional amine-based systems. Two different SMR plants using MDEA or [Bmim][Acetate] for CO2 capture were rigorously modelled using Aspen Plus to compute material and energy needs and emissions. Literature and simulation results were then used to perform a life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) of these processes based on the ReCiPe model. Solvent synthesis, CCS process and hydrogen production stages were considered for the cradle-to-gate analysis. Results showed that although [Bmim][Acetate] is a priori more harmful to the environment than amines (in a kg-to-kg comparison), LCIAs carried out for both CCS processes showed from 5 to 17 % lower environmental impacts values for all estimated categories when using [Bmim][Acetate] due to a 9.4 % more energy-efficient performance than MDEA, which also reduced a 17.4 % the total utility cost. Indeed, if a typical amine loss rate of 1.6 kg/tCO2 is assumed, the values of the environmental impacts increase up to 14 % for the IL-based CCS plant, but still maintaining its favorable results over MDEA. As consequence, the SMR plant with the IL-based CCS system exhibited 3–20 % lower values for most of the studied impact categories. These results contribute to shed some light on evaluating the sustainability of ILs with respect to conventional solvents for CO2 capture and to guide the synthesis of new more sustainable ILs but also, they would be used to compare the environmental burdens from the synthesis and process performance of other promising ILs for CO2 capture that are not environmentally assed yet. © 2023 The Author(s)"

Numerous cutting-edge, low-carbon-footprint innovations have recently been demonstrated to assist resolve this issue, including passive radiative cooling and sun heating. Their accessibility is nevertheless constrained to particular seasons or climate zones by the steady and one-sided control of temperature. Here, taking advantage of recent breakthroughs in photonic manipulation and radiative heat transfer technology, we propose phase-transition metamaterials with dynamically passive and radiative thermal regulation capability for temperature control that can be scaled up for application in buildings. At a critical temperature, the sun absorptance of this metafilm can self-modulate from 0.9 to 0.18 as a result of temperature changes. This metafilm is made of reflective silver (Ag) thin film on top of polyethylene (PE) film with vanadium dioxide (VO2) nanoparticles embedded in it. By varying the volume percentages of the VO2 nanoparticles and the PE matrix thickness, this metafilm's optical performance can be tailored. We model the inactive dynamic thermal regulator's equilibrium temperature response to diurnal temperature swings. The industrial film extrusion approach has the potential to produce the nanoparticles embedded into the polymer structure, and the physical vapor deposition method can deposit the Ag thin film scalably, both of which are encouraging for scale-up deployment. This passive radiative heat thermal management technology can be potentially applied to regions with extreme annual temperature fluctuations. © 2023"

This paper presents a comprehensive model to show the interaction between the networking and energy features of the problem and study the economical and technical viability of green networking. Solar equipment, cell zooming, energy management and dynamic user allocation are considered in the upgrading network planning process. We propose a mixed-integer optimization model to minimize long-term capital costs and operational energy expenditures in a heterogeneous on-grid cellular network with different types of base station, including solar. Based on eight scenarios where realistic costs of solar panels, batteries, and inverters were considered, we first found that solar base stations are currently not economically interesting for cellular operators. We next studied the impact of a significant and progressive carbon tax on reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). We found that, at current energy and equipment prices, a carbon tax ten-fold the current value is the only element that could make green base stations economically viable. © 2017 IEEE."

However, the evolution of the absolute RAN energy consumption with 5G deployment is not clear. Moreover, existing BS power models are mostly derived from legacy equipment. Therefore, this work presents a method to evaluate and to project the total energy consumption of broadband RANs. We use on-site up-to-date measurements to determine power models of 4G BSs, showing a linear relationship between power consumption and data traffic with a static traffic-independent power component. We then build a prospective power model of 5G BSs by scaling 4G models with respect to bandwidth, number of data streams, and expected technological improvements. We apply this method to the RANs in Belgium over the 2020–2025 period for six scenarios of 5G deployment. Results show that the static energy consumption accounts for a major part of the total RAN energy consumption, which implies that concurrently operating 4G and 5G RANs consumes more energy than using only one generation. The sleep mode feature of 5G technology can reduce its RAN static energy consumption, improving energy efficiency by 10 times compared to 4G. Finally, we estimate the absolute carbon footprint of 4G and 5G RANs by considering embodied and operating greenhouse gas emissions. They follow a clear upward trend for scenarios with extensive 5G deployment. © 2022, Institut Mines-Télécom and Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

In countries like Brazil, with a four-decade long experience with ethanol, the use of fossil fuels, although widespread, is being put under intense scrutiny. Governmental programs like ROTA 2030 stimulate engine research and development focused on environment-friendly fuels such as bioethanol-gasoline blends. Brazilian gasoline has about a quarter of ethanol, reducing the carbon footprint while maintaining suitable energy density. Regardless of the fuel, the load control method in part load operation of spark ignition engine causes a considerable penalty in fuel conversion efficiency. For these reasons, ozone addition was tested as an ignition enhancer that would allow higher de-throttling to reduce part-load pumping losses. The residual gas was used to dilute the mixture due to the possibility of keeping the three-way catalyst working properly with the stoichiometric mixture. An experimental investigation on efficiency, emissions and combustion related parameters was carried out in a downsized 1.0 l turbocharged direct-injected engine. Experimental tests were performed at 3 bar of indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP), 1500 rpm and stoichiometric air-fuel ratio. Spark timing (ST) was adjusted to achieve maximum indicated efficiency and the fuel used was Brazilian gasoline. Different ozone concentrations were used as a mixture with the intake air to overcome unstable engine operation by enhancing ignition. The results showed that it is possible to increase the gas exchange efficiency with ozone addition by promoting de-throttling operation with residual gases. Furthermore, the ozone addition exhibits the potential to promote autoignition of the end gas with spark assistance, even with a low compression ratio and residual gas fraction higher than 30%. However, the combustion efficiency is impaired by the higher residual gas fraction in some operation points that leave room for improvements. © IMechE 2022."

Traditional dairy systems depended on China's grasslands, but modern industrial systems using feed from croplands increase rapidly. The question is whether China can fulfill future milk demand using its natural resources and remain within greenhouse gas emission boundaries. To determine this, this study combines three footprint analyses - water footprint (WF), land footprint (LF) and carbon footprint (CF) - estimated via production chain approach. It compares WFs, LFs and CFs of milk, meat, and manure from six dairy systems in three categories: traditional grazing, traditional mixed, and modern industrial systems. It estimates future footprints for five production scenarios for low and high milk demand. Between 2000 and 2020, industrial systems increased, accounting for 79 % of production in 2020, while traditional production decreased. Traditional grazing systems have large green WFs per kg (17.2 m3), negligible blue WFs and large LFs (46 m2 low quality grassland). Traditional mixed systems have large CFs per kg (2.93 kg CO2) due to low efficiency. Modern industrial systems rely partly on irrigated croplands and have small green WFs, but large blue WFs per kg (0.54 m3), grey WFs (0.24 m3) and small LFs (1.80 m2 cropland). The findings indicate that with dominating industrial systems, milk production relies more on irrigation and limited croplands. In a realistic low demand situation, milk consumption stabilizes. However, consumption triples if the Chinese follow nutritional advice, resulting in 4 to 6 times larger WFs, LFs and CFs in 2035 depending on production scenarios. In 2035, population is largest, from 2035 to 2050 footprints decrease again. However, China cannot produce the milk for a high consumption situation limited by grassland and cropland availability. Alternatively, China could import feed or milk. However, it is questionable whether these huge quantities are available on the global market. © 2023 The Authors"

The U.S economy has been integrated into a multi-region input-output (MRIO) life cycle assessment framework where total of 40 major economies, including the USA, China, Russia, and others, plus the rest of the world (ROW) were modelled to assess global energy and carbon footprint impacts. Each country's economy is assumed to compromise 35 major industries based on the WIOD database classification. A total of 1435 (41 × 35 = 1435) industries has therefore been taken to represent the global structure of the world economy. The novelty of the approach is that the MRIO model has been developed in a stochastic fashion, plus global trade-linked uncertainties have also been taken into consideration. Top carbon emitting and energy consumer industries and countries have been analysed using data analytics and statistical modelling methods. The results show that the USA is the largest contributor to the total carbon footprint (CFP) and the total energy footprint (EFP) with 81.73% and 84%, respectively. Moreover, the agriculture/hunting forestry/fishing sector and the electricity/gas/water supply sectors dominate the overall U.S. carbon footprint, contributing 22% and 21.28%, respectively.

In this study, the AD of açaí seeds was evaluated under mesophilic temperature and dry regime. The stirred-tank reactor, composed of açaí seeds (25%), inoculum (45%), and water (30%), was started up and operated in batch mode for 40 days. The results demonstrate that the total solids’ biodegradation reached 59.38%, and the accumulated biogas produced was higher than 6 L. A stable methane content was obtained after 22 days of digestion, with a composition of around 60%. The experimental methane yield (156.65 mL CH4 g−1 TS) was higher than the theoretical methane yield (116.36 mL CH4 g−1 TS), demonstrating that the dry AD process was favorable to methane production. From the biogas combustion in a heat and power unit, 21.88 kWh of electricity and 98.48 MJ of heat could be produced from 1 ton of açaí seeds submitted to dry AD, mitigating a total of 7.15 × 10−3 tCO2eq. From the proposed industrial process intensification, the adoption of dry AD could supply 43.19% of the energy required by the açaí processing industry. Hence, the AD can be a technological route for bioenergy recovery, contributing for reducing the açaí industry’s carbon footprint while promoting environmental, social, and economic benefits for the local sustainable development.

In this work, commercial single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were activated with nitric acid and urea under ultrasonication and hydrothermal methods, respectively, to prepare N-doped CNTs with the functional group of −COOH, which possesses both basic and acid functionalities. The chemically modified CNTs with a concentration of 300 ppm universally catalyze both CO2 sorption and desorption of the CO2 capture process. The increases in the desorption rate achieved with the chemically modified CNTs can reach as high as 503% compared to that of the sorbent without the catalyst.

One tonne of cement produced emits approximately one tonne of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. To reduce the use of cement, new-generation concretes such as Alkali Activated Concrete, also known as geopolymer concrete (GPC), have been developed. Geopolymer is a novel material with the potential to replace conventional Portland cement. It is an inorganic material with an amorphous to semi-crystalline polymeric structure that is manufactured by alkali activation of amorphous aluminosilicates at ambient or slightly higher temperatures. In this study, geopolymer concrete was made with low-calcium fly ash. The geopolymer was created by combining sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide solutions with flyash. Other materials used for GPC include locally obtainable coarse aggregate and fine sand that is surface dried. Mettur Thermal Power Plant's low-calcium, Class F fly ash was used to make geopolymer concrete. Alkaline solution to fly ash ratio was varied from 0.3 to 0.45. The sodium hydroxide solution concentration was kept constant at 12M (Molars). After being cast in moulds; the specimens were placed in a 60°C oven for 24 hours before being allowed to air dry at room temperature. The compressive strength of geopolymer concrete was tested at 7 and 28 days of age. The test results show that compressive strength increases with an increase in alkali ratio and alkali-to-fly-ash ratio. The slump value for GPC is very less compared with conventional concrete. © 2006-2023 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN). All rights reserved."

Experiments were performed to obtain a minimum 28 days compressive strength of 15 MPa modified foamed concretes by using palm oil fuel ash (POFA) and fly ash (FA) as partial cement replacement and unprocessed rush husk ash (RHA) as partial fine aggregate replacement. Carbon footprint analysis was carried out by determining the CO2 emission for each constituent materials in the modified foamed concrete mixes. Although incorporation of POFA in the foamed concrete containing RHA fine aggregate gained lower mechanical strengths compared to the use of FA, the minimum compressive strength is still can be attained. In terms of the sustainability, modified foamed concrete with 30% POFA or 30% FA was found an encouraging reduction of carbon foot print up to about 30% compared to the control foamed concrete. Based on eco-strength indicator, the optimum foamed concrete mix with POFA was found to be at 22.5% cement replacement level. The eco-modified foamed concrete has good potential in civil engineering construction and environmentally friendly. © Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia Publisher’s Office."

In fact, effective assimilation of these attributes onto a single material with advance performance characteristics is practically imperative in view of renewable energy application and carbon-footprint reduction. Herein, we developed a three-fold interpenetrated robust Co(II) framework that embraces both redox-active and hydrogen-bond donor moieties inside the microporous channel. The activated MOF demonstrates notable OER catalysis in alkaline medium via quasi-reversible Co2+/Co3+couple and unveils low overpotential with impressive 53.5 mV/dec Tafel slope that overpowers some benchmark, commercial, as well as contemporary materials. In particular, significantly increased turnover frequency (3.313 s-1at 400 mV) and fairly low charge-transfer resistance (3.02 ω) compared to Co3O4, NiO, and majority of redox-active MOFs together with 91% Faradaic efficiency and notable framework durability after multiple OER cycles endorse high-performance water oxidation. Pore-wall decked urea groups benefit appreciable CO2adsorption even at elevated temperatures with considerable MOF-CO2interactions and exhibit recurrent capture-release cycles at diverse temperatures. Interestingly, CO2selectivity displays radical upsurge with temperature rise, affording 40% improved CO2/N2value of 200 at 313 K, which outperforms many porous adsorbents and delineates real-time CO2scavenging potential. The guest-free MOF effectively catalyzes solvent-free CO2cycloaddition with broad substrate tolerance and satisfactory reusability under relatively mild condition. Opposed to the common Lewis acid-mediated reaction, two-point hydrogen-bonding activates the substrate, as supported from controlled experiments, juxtaposing the performance of an un-functionalized MOF and fluorescence modification-derived framework-epoxide interaction, providing valuable insights on unconventional cycloaddition route in the MOF. © 2023 American Chemical Society.

As energy demands continue to rise, the urgent need for sustainable energy sources and effective carbon emissions reduction strategies becomes evident. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of energy consumption and carbon footprint (CF) in an electrical tramline, showcasing the potential of renewable energy sources in significantly reducing carbon emissions. The novelty of this research lies in the development of a quantitative model for estimating potential regenerative braking energy (RBE), as well as the integration of renewable energy sources to curb CF in the transportation sector. The paper proposes a quantitative model to estimate the speed profile of the tramline based on the vehicle's dynamic data and line geometry parameters. The mathematical model is successfully simulated as an m-file using the MATLAB® program. The findings indicate that a remarkable 27.60% of the yearly consumed energy can be potentially regenerated, resulting in a carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction of 278.5 tons for a full cycle trip. Moreover, by complementing the tramline with station rooftop solar power plants, the energy savings can be amplified to 58%, leading to a relative enhancement in the reduction of the carbon footprint. This article emphasizes the key advantages of harnessing regenerative braking energy and integrating renewable energy sources in the context of electrical railways.

This paper aims to find the superiority of aircraft design technology which triggers the reduction in specific fuel consumption (SFC) and economic competitiveness. Design/methodology/approach: The real case study is performed with 22 middle-of-the-market (MoM) aircraft. This paper develops a fuel burn mathematical model for mid-size transport aircraft by a multi-linear regression approach. In addition, sensitivity analysis is performed to establish the authentication of the fuel burn model. Findings: The study reveals that the MoM aircraft would be the future aircraft design in terms of better fuel economy and carbon footprint. From the multi-regression analysis, it is observed that the logarithmic regression model is the best fit for estimating the SFC. Moreover, fineness ratio, aspect ratio, gross weight, payload weight fraction, empty weight fraction), fuel weight fraction, payload, wing loading, thrust loading, range, take-off distance, cruise speed and rate of climb are observed as the suitable parameters which provide the best fitness value as 0.9804. Originality/value: Several existing literature reveals that a few research has been performed on the MoM aircraft with wide-body configuration. Moreover, mathematical modelling on the fuel consumption was insignificantly found. This study examines several parameters which affect the fuel consumption of a wide-body aircraft. A real-case study for design configurations, propulsive systems, performance characteristics and structural integrity parameters of 22 different MoM aircraft are performed.

However, the effect of RP on magnesium potassium phosphate cement (MKPC) has not been sufficiently studied. In this study, MKPC pastes were prepared by replacing different contents of MgO with RP, and the evolution of the structural behavior was explained from nanoscale to microscale. The results show that incorporating an appropriate amount of RP can increase the fluidity and setting time of the MKPC mixture and improve its mechanical properties. The drying shrinkage and water resistance of MKPC specimens also improve with the increasing RP content. Incorporating an appropriate amount of RP can refine the pore structure of MKPC samples, while the generation of gel-like products can compensate for the adverse effects of reduced struvite-K content. The nanoscale characteristics of the MKPC samples also indicate that incorporating RP results in a decrease in the residual MgO and pore phase content, an increase in the content of the hydrated phase, and a decrease in the loss of the hydrated phase volume fraction due to water soaking. Upon optimizing the RP content, the MKPC mixture exhibits a lower cost and carbon footprint, with the 28-d compressive strength of the sample mixed with 10% RP increased by 7.36% relative to the plain sample, indicating that recycling RP is feasible in an eco-friendly MKPC system. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l."

We are only able to maintain the high quality obtained by proper cultivation and growing techniques. Unfortunately, we lose a significant part of produced horticultural crops including ornamental products after harvest. The lost product has a huge carbon footprint. The most important postharvest factor in maintaining quality and preventing losses of ornamentals is temperature. The cut flowers that are not sensitive to chilling injury should be stored close to 0°C. This, however, requires more energy for cooling and thus needs the use and development of sustainable cooling principles. One obvious solution for storage facilities is the use of solar power. Various systems have been developed to store surplus energy during the daytime in the form of an ice buffer that can be used during the night to keep the product cool. Other smart cooling principles such as the Quest technology developed at Wageningen Food and Biobased Research, runs on reefer containers. These aid in saving energy and lowering the carbon footprint during refrigerated transport. Cut flowers should be transported at low temperatures to keep them fresh from grower to consumer. However, refrigerated trucks use about 25% more fuel than non-refrigerated ones. Shipping containers by sea is a more sustainable alternative to conventional airfreight and overland transport with significantly smaller CO2 emissions per ton per kilometer carried. Eco-friendly treatments such as spray, pulsing, and vase solutions are another important issue in sustainability of flower industry. After harvest, cut flowers are commonly treated with a range of compounds with the aim to improve the storage performance and to prolong the vase life. Eco-friendly and sustainable pulsing and vase solutions such as natural extracts from medicinal plants should be preferred as a biocide in pulsing or vase solutions to maintain the postharvest quality of cut flowers and greens. Plastics are being replaced by biodegradable packaging, ecofriendly renewable and recyclable materials, new heat-sealable, fiber-based materials from sustainably managed or certified forests, and other sustainable coatings. Novel procedures based on temperature treatments under controlled atmospheres (CATT) can replace the use of harmful chemicals in insect disinfection. Finally, advanced control of the distribution chain from grower till consumer can ensure that product losses are minimized, contributing to the sustainability of the value chain. © 2023 International Society for Horticultural Science.

AIPH anticipates that the global market for flower and ornamental plants will grow by 6.3% over the next five years, fuelled in part by an increasing population, but more so by greater urbanisation. With more people residing in cities, the demand for central recreation districts and green infrastructure is expanding. In their daily life, consumers today are adopting a more holistic approach to health and wellness, placing greater value on the benefits ornamental plants provide to both interior and exterior landscapes. With a greater focus on ethical living, consumers are investing more in themselves and their homes, choosing local plants that are less resource demanding and which simultaneously deliver benefits to wildlife and the household. Digitalisation, through social media, is changing the way in which consumers connect, share their experiences and how consumers purchase plants. The more widespread adoption of blockchain technology is expected to result in greater transparency providing consumers with more information about the carbon footprint and the social and environmental management systems plant producers have employed. To remain competitive, plant producers will need to engage in relentless innovation. Automated plant production systems, controlled environments, robotics and genomics will be utilized to deliver the novel, unique colors and forms at the desired time and place more cost effectively. © 2023 International Society for Horticultural Science.

A key assumption is that DR reactors could operate with increasingly hydrogen enriched reducing gas. In addition, prior to using green hydrogen, they would be able to use blue hydrogen produced from steam methane reforming with carbon capture and storage, the so-called blue hydrogen. This assumption is supported by the allegation that blue hydrogen is a lower CO2eq emitter than the natural gas used to produce the reducing gas in the DR processes. However, life cycle assessments of blue hydrogen production have shown that the carbon footprint associated with the use of such gas is only about 10% less intense than the carbon footprint associated with the use of natural gas, due to the inefficiencies of carbon capture systems, and upstream and downstream methane emissions associated with the blue hydrogen production. In this paper, the GHG footprints of different decarbonization alternatives for the steel industry are evaluated. In fact, the reduction claim of 43% in CO2eq emission from the migration of BF-BOF route to natural gas-based DR-EAF (NG-DRI-EAF) may be reduced to only 22%, when methane emissions are considered. Hence, only DR-EAF with green hydrogen and renewable energy supply could lead to the production of truly low GHG footprint steel, with less than 600 kg of CO2eq emission per ton of crude steel. © 2023 The Author(s)"

1337,Techno-economic analysis of fixed versus sun-tracking solar panels,Article,Gol A.E.; Ščasný M.,International Journal of Renewable Energy Development,12.0,2023,615,626,10.14710/ijred.2023.50165,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85162876731&doi=10.14710%2fijred.2023.50165&partnerID=40&md5=9148b6bedf352ea348221a39435e644d,22524940,Scopus,financial analysis; GHG emission; LCOE; photovoltaic; solar energy; tracking system,"The potential output of photovoltaic (PV) panels is influenced by several factors, including the direction of solar radiation from the sun toward the panel’s surface. The maximum output of the panels is obtained when the panels are vertical to the sun's rays. In this study, a techno-economic analysis is conducted to examine whether an automatic one-axis sun tracker system is an economically feasible option for installing a large-scale PV park in the Nicosia district in the central part of Cyprus. The performance of a one-axis sun tracker with an installed capacity of 781 kWp is compared to a PV system with a fixed flat structure having the same capacity and larger capacity at 1034 kWp. Output generated by the three PV system options is simulated by three alternative simulation software (SolarGIS, PVSyst, and PVGIS). Financial analysis is performed utilizing simulated PV power output, accounting for electricity feed-in tariff and overall cost of the project. The cash-flow model is run for several scenarios defined by different leverage ratios, including no leverage. Considering the technical parameters of a PV system and solar panel characteristics, such as the degradation effect on solar panel efficiency and solar radiation, we estimate the solar tracking system produces about 20%-30% more energy compared to a fixed structure. We find both technologies are economically viable options, however, a one-axis tracker system performs better financially. LCOE in all scenarios is below the highest acceptable level for solar PV projects in Cyprus which is 103 EUR per MWh. LCOE for a solar tracker PV is 39 EUR per MWh with a 30% leverage ratio and up to 79 EUR per MWh with 85% leverage. LCOE for a sun-tracker is ~20% lower than LCOE for a PV with a fixed axis of comparable size. Despite higher investment costs, the solar tracking PV system performs with a 12% higher equity internal rate of return, and a 9% shorter loan payback period compared to the same installed power of a fixed structure. The Financial analysis is complemented by quantified benefits due to avoided carbon emissions. Accounting for carbon benefits makes a sun-tracker PV system economically a better option over the fixed tracker PV system, resulting in 228,000 EUR more benefits. Overall, the present value of net benefits of a solar-tracker PV amounts to 1.39 mil. EUR and due to high irradiation in Cyprus, the carbon footprint of PV power output represents only 6% of the footprint of generating electricity in thermal power plants. When these benefits are accounted for the sum of NPV and social benefits will turn out to be higher for a one-axis tracker compared to the total social benefits of a fixed tracker of the same size. © 2023.The Author(s)."
1338,Performance enhancement and emissions reduction in a diesel engine using oleander and croton biodiesel doped with graphene nanoparticles,Article,Wambui T.; Hawi M.; Njoka F.; Kamau J.,International Journal of Renewable Energy Development,12.0,2023,635,647,10.14710/ijred.2023.51785,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85162869528&doi=10.14710%2fijred.2023.51785&partnerID=40&md5=65a855d1b5d2479b1c4f3a48f0e048c9,22524940,Scopus,Biodiesel; Compression ignition engine; Emission; Engine Performance; Nano additives,"Biodiesel is considered a suitable substitute for petroleum diesel because it is renewable, environment-friendly, and has a low carbon footprint. However, its high density, high viscosity and low heating value prevents it from replacing petroleum diesel completely. This study investigates the performance and emission characteristics of a compression ignition engine operating on oleander and croton biodiesel doped with graphene nanoparticles. Five fuel samples are used, including diesel (D100), diesel-80% blended with oleander and croton biodiesel-20% (OCB20) and OCB20 dosed with graphene nanoparticles at mass fractions of 50 ppm (mg/L), 75 ppm (mg/L) and 100 ppm (mg/L), respectively. The chemical composition of biodiesel and graphene nanoparticles is analyzed using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy while the morphology of the nanoparticles is analyzed using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Engine tests reveal a significant improvement in brake thermal efficiency, especially at 75 ppm concentration which is 2.76% and 18.93% higher than diesel and OCB20, respectively, and a reduction in brake specific fuel consumption by 2.44% and 16.67% compared to diesel and OCB20, respectively. Carbon monoxide (CO) and unburnt hydrocarbon emissions (UHC) decreases for the 50 ppm sample, recording 8.58% and 21.65% reduction in CO and 52.2% and 50% in UHC compared to the diesel and OCB20, respectively. However, Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) emissions increase. The results indicate that graphene nanoparticle-enhanced biodiesel can adequately substitute petroleum diesel, albeit with NOx reduction techniques. © 2023.The Author(s)."

We have shown that for a specific spectral efficiency a wireless system using the proposed virtual antenna array consumes significantly less energy per bit (∼3 dB) than a wireless system using a conventional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) array. This means the adoption of the proposed VAA technology in smartphones, iPad, Tablets and even base-stations should significantly reduce the carbon footprint of wireless systems. The proposed VAA is realized by employing a pair of linear antenna arrays that are placed in an orthogonal configuration relative to each other. This orthogonal arrangement ensures the radiation is circularly polarized. The size of the standard radiating elements constituting the VAA were miniaturized using the topology optimization method. The design of the VAA incorporates substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) and metasurface technologies. The function of SIW in the design was twofold, namely, to reduce energy loss in the substrate on which the VAA is implemented, and secondly to mitigate unwanted electromagnetic interactions between the neighboring radiating elements and thereby enhancing isolation which otherwise would degrade the radiation characteristics of the array. Metasurface technology served to effectively increase the effective aperture of the array with no impact on the footprint of the array. The consequence of SIW and metasurface technologies was improvement in the gain and radiation efficiency of the array. The proposed four orthogonal 4-element VAA covers the entire sub-5 GHz frequency range, and it radiates bidirectional in the azimuth plane and omni-directional in the elevation plane. Moreover, it is relatively easy to design and fabricate. The proposed VAA has dimensions of 0.96λ0 × 0.96λ0 × 0.0016λ0 at mid-band frequency of 3 GHz. VAA has a measured gain of 25 dBi and radiates with 90% efficiency. The average isolation between the linear arrays constituting the virtual array is better than 27 dB. © 2023 Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University"

It analyzes the historical evidence from 1995 to 2018 using new metal production, energy use, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission extensions made for the multiregional input-output model EXIOBASE. A combination of established input-output methods (index decomposition analysis, hypothetical extraction method, and footprint analysis) is used to dissect the drivers of the change in the upstream emissions occurring due to the production of metals demanded by other (downstream) economic activities. On a global level, GHG emissions from metal production have increased at a similar pace as the GDP but have decreased in high-income countries in the most recent 6 year period studied. This absolute decoupling in industrialized countries is mainly driven by reduced metal consumption intensity and improved energy efficiency. However, in emerging economies increasing metal consumption intensity and affluency have driven up emissions, more than offsetting any reductions due to improved energy efficiency. © 2023 The Authors.

In this work, we present miniaturized GaN-on-Si voltage sensors based on a back-gate topology: high-voltage signals VIN applied on the substrate, and low-voltage OU or low-current IOUT output signals determined from the varying resistance of the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the device channel. The device presented high sensitivity of 5.97 0.16S , high input resistance RIN up to 1.3 T, and a low input capacitance of 1.6 nF/cm2. Excellent linearity and repeatability were demonstrated in both static and dynamic tests despite the trapping effects caused by carbon doping, thanks to an increased buffer thickness TBUF. The rise and fall times tR and tF are as short as 3.8 ± 0.22 and 3.2 0.13s, respectively, resulting in a large 3 dB bandwidth up to 180 kHz. In addition, the bipolar voltage sensing with high sensitivity and high linearity is also presented based on the p-GaN cap topology. The excellent performance and small footprint of the device, in addition to the low cost of the GaN-on-Si platform, render itself a promising candidate for future compact on-site DC voltage sensing applications.  © 2001-2012 IEEE."

It strengthens “social foundations” and creates sustainable values through its multiplier effects and interconnectedness with Sustainable Development Goals. Equally important are tourism’s environmental impacts, carbon footprints, and greenhouse gas emissions, which are likely to exacerbate by rising global tourism and unending demands for materials, resources, and products. Thus, the prevalent ‘business as usual’ production approach is widely questioned, and decoupling the socioeconomic development from environmental impacts is emphasized to lay down the basis of sustainable and smart green tourism by applying circular economy principles in tourism. The coronavirus, though it was an irreparable disaster for tourism, gave an opportunity to rebuild it on circular economy principles. This paper explored the interlinkages between the circular economy and the tourism industry from the perspective of building a circular ecosystem in tourism, given its interdependence and interconnectedness. The approach followed is qualitative and exploratory, and reviews the available literature, which is fragmented and scattered. It brings out that deep interlinkages exist between the circular economy and travel and tourism; and the circular economy principles’ application (6Rs-refuse, reduce, reuse, repair, refurbish, recycle) in tourism can contribute substantially towards resilient tourism ecosystem and social and economic progress through reduced consumption of primary energy sources and materials. The practical and theoretical implications are clearly visible to all stakeholders, including managers, policymakers, and organizations. Managers face a challenge to find ways and means to initiate a transition to a circular economy in tourism to bring down the circularity gap.

It can cultivate consumers' low-carbon consumption awareness and consumption habits, and also an important means to promote the green and low-carbon transformation of traditional high-carbon industrial chain. Based on the cold chain composed of upstream suppliers, distribution centers with logistics and product value-added services and downstream retailers, this paper considers the carbon emission reduction investment of distribution centers and implements carbon labeling system. The carbon footprint and sales price of fresh products are introduced to describe the demand of low-carbon preference consumer market, and the deterioration rate of fresh products is described by Weibull distribution function. The inventory optimization models of each participant in the cold chain of fresh products are constructed and simulated. Combined with the survey data, the genetic algorithm is used to search the optimal decision variables, and the sensitivity of the deterioration rate of fresh products and the carbon footprint sensitivity coefficient is analyzed. The research results show that the carbon label attached to the distribution center for carbon emission reduction can effectively reduce the carbon emission in the cold chain inventory link and optimize the inventory of each node in the supply chain. The established mathematical model and the research conclusions can provide a useful reference for the practice of energy conservation and emission reduction of the cold chain inventory optimization of fresh products. © 2023 Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Romania.

1345,Use of nested multi-regional input–output analysis for the evaluation of subnational emission reduction policies: A case of Japanese prefectures,Article,Sato I.; Narita D.,Sustainable Production and Consumption,37.0,2023,294,305,10.1016/j.spc.2023.03.003,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85150066562&doi=10.1016%2fj.spc.2023.03.003&partnerID=40&md5=bb224a770d1c016129db14ad246aa5da,23525509,Scopus,Carbon footprint; Consumption-based emission; Input–output analysis; Nested model; Renewable electricity; Subnational region,"Many subnational regions around the world, in their own capacity for policy formulation and implementation, have set targets for net-zero carbon dioxide or greenhouse gas emissions. However, most targets do not consider consumption-based emissions, which include emissions generated outside their borders to produce the products they consume. It is partly due to methodological difficulties and data gaps that subnational governments often face but this situation could misguide their efforts in the face of the goal of reducing global emissions. To facilitate an understanding of consumption-based subnational carbon emissions and informed subnational policymaking, this study proposes a relatively simple and less data-intensive methodology for subnational consumption-based emission analysis. It uses a nested multi-regional input–output approach by combining a publicly available global multi-regional input–output table and a subnational input–output table, whose computation is repeated for multiple regions for comparison. A case study of three Japanese prefectures with different levels of renewable electricity consumption was conducted using the 2015 datasets. The results showed that two prefectures with similar socioeconomic conditions, except for their totally different renewable electricity ratios (90 % and 4.6 %), exhibited a 25 % difference (4.4- and 6.0-ton CO2) in per capita household consumption-based carbon dioxide emissions in 2015. Counterfactual policy scenarios were analyzed using the constructed models. Application of an increased renewable electricity scenario indicated that an approximate 10 % increase in the prefectural renewable electricity ratio could reduce household per capita consumption-based emissions by 151–179 kg CO2 in those prefectures. Consumption-based emissions disaggregated by product category indicated that increasing the renewable electricity ratio had significant consumption-based emission reduction effects on not only electricity itself but also on services, particularly commerce, hotel, and restaurant services. The potential impacts of changing renewable electricity ratios on consumption-based emissions were found to be high for products whose share in household spending on local products and electricity cost in their production was large. A scenario analysis of home electrification, assuming the total replacement of household fuel gases and kerosene with electricity, resulted in a modest consumption-based emission reduction potential of less than 10 % for a prefecture with a high renewable electricity ratio and even showed a slight emission increase for a prefecture with a low renewable electricity ratio. In using commonly available datasets without the need to model trade flows between subnational regions, this study's method could realistically be applied by subnational governments to estimate consumption-based emissions of their jurisdiction, compared with other regions, and analyze the potential effects of emission reduction policy scenarios. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

At the Leaders' Climate Summit, the US president outlined specific targets to tackle climate change, including a 50 to 52 percent reduction in net CO2 emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. Therefore, it is critical to pinpoint the key factors succumbing to the heightened commitment to accomplishing the SDGs. The study explores the relationship between renewable energy, fossil fuel energy, natural resources depletion, and globalization on CO2 emissions in the United States from 1980 to 2018 by employing the novel dynamic Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) simulations and Kernel-based Regularized Least Squares (KRLS) machine learning approach. The findings indicated that renewable energy has a positive long-term impact, suggesting that the United States has not yet reached a point where renewable energy sources are sufficient to reduce CO2 emissions. However, shock in fossil fuel energy increases CO2 emissions in the long run. The empirical findings reveal that natural resource depletion stimulates CO2 emissions in the short- and long run. Finally, globalization found no evidence to affect environmental pollution. The KRLS approach has confirmed the hypothesis substantially. The results suggest the growth of renewable energy and diminishing dependency on fossil fuel use; also, the management of ecological footprint could play an imperative role in environmental sustainability. © 2023 International Association for Gondwana Research"

The latter has become very important due to the need to lower the carbon footprint of museums and historical houses. In order to address this need, we have developed numerical models based on finite element analysis to simulate the initiation of two types of potential damage in panel paintings, namely interfacial and channelling cracks in the oil paint layer, under cyclically varying relative humidity. These models are based on our case study at Knole House (National Trust), Kent. Using known data for the past environment in which the paintings within the Brown Gallery at Knole House have been exposed, the ambient RH variation was approximated by three cycles, i.e., annual, biannual, and monthly varying cycles. Four RH cases, one containing all three cycles and each of the other three cases containing just two of the three cycles, were applied as boundary conditions to simplified geometries of the panel paintings in an effort to investigate the effects of the frequency and the amplitude of the variation on the possibility of cracking in the painting. The models need several material parameters as input which are not all available. Therefore, the study also includes some parametric studies to determine possible variations in the crack initiation. According to the model predictions, the channelling crack initiates slightly earlier than the interfacial crack. The crack initiation time in an uncontrolled environment (containing all three RH cycles) predicted by the model is approximately 120 years which empirically is a realistic estimate. Furthermore, the annual RH cycle (high amplitude and low frequency) has the most significant effect on the crack initiation. By removing the annual variation from the RH cycle, the initiation of both channelling and interfacial cracks can be postponed significantly, from approximately 120 years to over 400 years. © 2023 The Authors"

The impact of emission transfer due to the separation between food production and consumption within the context of carbon neutrality remains unclear. In this study, we constructed an emission inventory for three types of grains at the production stage of their life cycle and then analysed the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of the grain supply and demand. With the use of a spatial equilibrium model, we simulated the spatial distribution flow of the different types of grains from 1990 to 2018 and calculated the resulting GHG emission transfer efficiency. The main results include the following: (1) The imbalance between the grain supply and demand intensified, which was mainly reflected in the distance between the geographic centre of the grain supply and consumption increasing 3.2 times, and thus, the self-sufficiency decreased. (2) The total emission transfer TET of rice and wheat decreased because of the increase in the intra-regional supply, while that of maize gradually increased due to the increase in the inter-regional supply. (3) Overall, grain trade improved the carbon efficiency of grain production in China. The trade efficiency of crops varied, with wheat and maize leading to overall effective carbon reductions, while the carbon transfer efficiency of rice from trade was relatively low. (4) The carbon footprint of grain production in China’s provinces exhibited a downward trend, but due to the intensified separation between the grain supply and demand, certain major grain-producing areas achieved inefficient carbon increases. Therefore, we suggest further optimization of the spatial structure of planting and breeding, strengthening of the grain supply in the region, and enhancement in the optimization of the low-carbon production structure and adjustment of cultivated land use combined with regional governance strategies. The application of these measures could contribute to achieving dual-carbon goals. © 2023, Science China Press."

We use a choice architecture taxonomy dividing the nudges into decision information, decision structure, and decision assistance. We find that most retailers use several types of climate nudges. Most of these are decision information type nudges, such as personalized carbon footprint apps and climate labels. Wide use of non-salient nudges, often presenting the climate impact after the customers have made their purchase, limits the potential impact of information on consumers' environmental footprints. Furthermore, the use of broad climate categories and aggregated CO2 measures reflect the challenges in calculating the footprints of individual products. The lack of industry-wide standards for emission data and climate labels makes the current situation challenging for customers wanting to compare emissions across stores. Our results also show that few stores have any form of decision structure or decision assistance nudges, even though these are often found to be the most effective types in the literature on nudges. We end with discussing promising digital climate nudging opportunities for retailers seeking to reduce the environmental footprint of their customers. © 2023 The Authors"

The current study performs a systematic review of firm-level carbon disclosure under carbon disclosure project (CDP) publications to articulate key research themes based on bibliographic coupling, citation mapping and content analysis. VOSViewer was used to analyze carbon disclosure literature to provide a comprehensive overview of research themes, most-contributing authors, research journals, and keywords. Our findings reveal that climate change strategies, carbon footprint and market response to climate change (cluster 1), carbon information, stock market & financial performance and impact of environmental penalties over the cost of capital (cluster 2), GHG disclosure, stakeholder relevance and BOD effectiveness in environmental strategies (cluster 3) and determinants for dissemination of environmental information, carbon mitigation, and carbon management systems (cluster 4) are the most significant research themes within the existing research. Based on our research analysis, we provide several key policy recommendations to use carbon disclosure practices as a benchmark in evaluating firms’ commitment to environmental sustainability. © 2023 International Association for Gondwana Research"
1351,Comparative Environmental Impact Assessment of Battery Electric Vehicles and Conventional Vehicles: A Case Study of India,Article,Bhosale A.P.; Mastud S.A.,"International Journal of Engineering, Transactions B: Applications",36.0,2023,965,978,10.5829/ije.2023.36.05b.13,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85158867095&doi=10.5829%2fije.2023.36.05b.13&partnerID=40&md5=8c2ef9ff8d0803341eb55db43cdc2a3b,1728144X,Scopus,Battery Electric Vehicles; Electric Vehicles; Environmental Analysis; Life Cycle Analysis,"The battery electric vehicle (BEV) adaptation is at an accelerated pace due to its zero tail-pipe emissions and estimated environmental benefits. However, when considering an electric vehicle's entire life cycle, the environmental benefit could be a deception. It should be reckoned whether electric vehicles are really environmentally friendly and if they are, then under which conditions? According to the literature, the carbon footprint of electric mobility varies by geographic location as well as by the regional energy mix and the environmental impacts might exacerbate by introducing a plethora of electric vehicle. Since very less research has been carried out in the Indian context; this paper contemplates the environmental impacts of BEV and compares it with conventional vehicles performing a life cycle assessment.The paramount purpose of the study is to unveil weather BEVs are low carbon transport mode in India and where do they stand compared globaly. The results reveal that out of 18 impact categories considered under mid-point analysis, BEV outperformed IC Engine vehicles for 10 categories. The green house gases emissions from a BEV is 242 g CO2eq/km at mid-point level and the single score at end-point level is 0.58 kpt compared to that of ICEV which has 2.1 kpt. Further, separate impacts from the production and the use-to-end life phase were derived to pinpoint the major emission contribution phase. At the ReCePi end-point analysis BEV favors being more environmentally friendly, however, switching to cleaner energy will further alleviate the environmental impacts. © 2023 Materials and Energy Research Center.

1352,Diverting residual biomass to energy use: Quantifying the global warming potential of biogenic CO2 (GWPbCO2),Article,Adetona A.B.; Layzell D.B.,GCB Bioenergy,15.0,2023,697,709,10.1111/gcbb.13048,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85150645671&doi=10.1111%2fgcbb.13048&partnerID=40&md5=0ed01be80d4fecde88994ece920d8a83,17571693,Scopus,biogenic CO<sub>2</sub>; climate change; energy; fossil fuel; global warming potential; residual biomass,"To calculate the global warming potential of biogenic carbon dioxide emissions (GWPbCO2) associated with diverting residual biomass to bioenergy use, the decay of annual biogenic carbon pulses into the atmosphere over 100 years was compared between biomass use for energy and its business-as-usual decomposition in agricultural, forestry, or landfill sites. Bioenergy use increased atmospheric CO2 load in all cases, resulting in a 100GWPbCO2 (units of g CO2e/g biomass CO2 released) of 0.003 for the fast-decomposing agricultural residues to 0.029 for the slow, 0.084–0.625 for forest residues, and 0.368–0.975 for landfill lignocellulosic biomass. In comparison, carbon emissions from fossil fuels have a 100GWP of 1.0 g (CO2e/g fossil CO2). The fast decomposition rate and the corresponding low 100GWPbCO2 values of agricultural residues make them a more climate-friendly feedstock for bioenergy production relative to forest residues and landfill lignocellulosic biomass. This study shows that CO2 released from the combustion of bioenergy or biofuels made from residual biomass has a greenhouse gas footprint that should be considered in assessing climate impacts. © 2023 The Authors.

As of today, there are no established sustainability reported results to inform consumers about the carbon footprint of hygiene tissue. To fill this gap, this study used Life Cycle Assessment to evaluate the environmental impacts across the supply chain (cradle to gate) to produce Premium and Ultra grades of bath tissue, including the production of feedstock, pulp production, and tissue production stages, with focus on Global Warming Potential (GWP). The results showed that one air-dried metric ton (ADmt) of BEK pulp had an associated GWP of 388 kgCO2eq, whereas one ADmt of NBSK pulp presented values ranging between 448 and 596 kgCO2eq, depending on the emissions allocation methodology used. It was estimated that the GWP of one finished metric ton of tissue weighted average could range from 1,392 to 3,075 kgCO2eq depending on mill location, electricity source, and machine technology. These results provide an understanding of the factors affecting the environmental impact of hygiene tissue products, which could guide manufacturers and consumers on decisions that impact their carbon footprint. © 2023, North Carolina State University.

In doing so, the current study empirically evaluates the role of green finance, eco-innovation, and environmental policy stringency on the ecological footprint in China. To meet the objectives, the novel quantile autoregressive distributed lag (QARDL) approach was employed from 2000 to 2017. The outcomes reveal heterogeneous associations between the proposed variables. Manifestly, the QARDL estimation results demonstrate a positive impact between eco-innovation, green finance, and environmental policy stringency with the ecological footprints of China; however, the extent of the relationship is quantile dependent. The outcomes are further validated through the Wald test of parameter constancy. The bi-direction causality is observed among all variables at several quantiles. The current study offers policymakers helpful suggestions on enhancing the positive effects of environmentally supported innovation, green finance, and stringent environmental policies on the ecosystem. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

1357,Regional and spatial impacts of external and internal conflicts on ecological footprint: the case of Middle East and Africa,Article,Khezri M.; Mamkhezri J.; Razzaghi S.,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,30.0,2023,63631,63646,10.1007/s11356-023-26692-0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152706908&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-023-26692-0&partnerID=40&md5=2aaeb65b7757dc4dd5209158fec71584,09441344,Scopus,Ecological footprint; External conflict; Internal conflict; Middle East and Africa; Spatial econometrics,"The economic and environmental structures of countries are greatly impacted by domestic and foreign conflicts. To promote sustainable development, it is crucial to understand the spatial impact of these conflicts on the ecological footprint of a region. With a focus on Middle Eastern and African countries, this paper investigates the impact of such conflicts on their environments, taking into consideration the unique spatial features of their ecological footprints. Using a spatial econometric model, the study assesses the contributions of ecological footprint determinants, particularly internal and external conflict indicators, across 46 Middle Eastern and African countries from 2001 to 2019. The results indicate that internal conflict can lead to increased pressure on natural resources and ecological systems in neighboring countries, while energy use and economic growth impose a significant ecological burden both domestically and abroad. While urbanization and resource rents were found to reduce the ecological footprint, trade openness was found to be nonsignificant. Conflicts such as war, foreign pressure, civil war, and civil disorder were found to have a significant negative impact on the environment, suggesting that reducing these conflicts would improve environmental circumstances. The findings highlight the need for conflict resolution measures to achieve a sustainable environment in the Middle Eastern and African regions and have implications for other countries facing similar issues. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

The analysis is performed for total natural resources and different types of natural resources, including oil, natural gas, and minerals. This research employs the dynamic Autoregressive Distributed Lag (DYNARDL) simulation approach. In addition to its statistical and computational superiority, the DYNARDL allows assessing the environmental repercussions of shocks that occurred on natural resources in both the short- and long-run. The findings suggest that total, oil, and natural gas rents have a positive symmetric association with the ecological footprint in the long run, while no significant impact is identified for mineral resources. When conducting the asymmetric analysis, the findings reveal that only increases in total, oil, and natural gas rents deteriorate the ecological footprint in the long run, while no effects are confirmed for decreases in natural resource rents. The shock analysis reveals that a 10% increase in total and oil rents leads to environmental degradation by 3% in the long run, while a similar upsurge in natural gas rents induces a 4% deterioration in environmental quality. These findings may help design effective resource-use policies to achieve environmental sustainability in Saudi Arabia. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

There is a requirement to capture and utilize maximum solar irradiance as an alternate energy source to reduce carbon footprints. Maximum solar insolation can be captured if solar photovoltaic (PV) panels are tilted at optimum tilt angles facing the Sun instead of placing horizontally. In this paper, optimum tilt angle of south facing solar panels is estimated using INSAT-3D-based global horizontal irradiance, direct normal irradiance and diffused horizontal irradiance products available at 4 km resolution using Liu and Jorden model over the Indian region. The optimization problem is solved using particle swarm optimization–nonlinear time varying evolution (PSO-NTVE). The estimated optimal solar tilt angles using INSAT-3D solar insolation products are bias-corrected with available in situ solar data of 20 cities of India and validated successfully with other independent research in this domain.

This study assesses the carbon footprint and life cycle environmental impacts of the production, usage, and disposal of low density polyethylene (LDPE) and two natural fibre carrier bags (jute and kenaf). Life cycle assessment study was conducted of all inputs and outputs, aggregated in the form of resources used and environmental emissions, extending from the production of raw materials to the final disposal of the product. The carbon footprint and GHG emissions of jute and kenaf carrier bags were estimated using the CO2, N2O, and CH4 emissions coefficients of inputs. Research literature from life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) results was used to determine the effects of LDPE polyethylene packaging material. It was observed that the global warming potential (GWP) for the production of 1 kg of LDPE (100 micron) carrier bag (39.4 kg CO2eq) is more than 490 times higher than jute and kenaf carrier bags. In general, LDPE materials have the greatest impact on the carbon footprint and resource depletion. The LDPE material also has the highest impacts on indicators of terrestrial ecotoxicity, photochemical oxidation, acidification, and eutrophication as compared to jute and kenaf fibres. Since jute and kenaf are natural fibres, they sequester a substantial quantity of carbon during their agricultural stages. As a result, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission emissions of jute and kenaf were found to be negative. Popularising the use of jute and kenaf products as alternatives to plastic in industrialised countries would benefit the reduction of plastic waste and its negative environmental effects. Additional production of jute and kenaf fibre, which are already available in major bast fibre producing countries like India and Bangladesh, could meet the demand for fibre-based carrier bags. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Exploiting the superior corrosion and strength-to-weight properties of structural aluminium, research on composite aluminium-concrete members has been reported. Aiming for an even more sustainable and durable structural member, this paper proposes combining structural aluminium alloys with low carbon geopolymer concrete (GC) to form a structural member with lower environmental footprint. To this end, an experimental programme on geopolymer concrete-filled aluminium alloy tubular (GCFAT) cross-sections is performed. A total of 24 tests on stub columns and 12 tests on beams were carried out. In particular, 4 square hollow sections infilled with one-part geopolymer concrete were tested under uniform compression and under uniaxial bending. The hollow sections were fabricated from 6082-T6 heat-treated aluminium alloy. The same cross-sections were also tested as bare and infilled with ordinary Portland cement (OPC) concrete for comparison purposes. It is shown that the strength of the composite sections is significantly increased compared to the bare ones. In particular, the average strength increase was in the range of 16.5%–93.3% and of 23%–93.1% for GC and OPC-aluminium stub columns, respectively. In beams, the strength increase was in the range of 14.1%–53.6% for GC-aluminium and of 10.2%–48.9% for OPC-aluminium specimens. In absence of codified design rules for geopolymer concrete-aluminium structures, design formulae based on the European standards for composite steel–concrete members, with the material properties of steel and concrete replaced by those of aluminium alloy and GC, respectively, are adopted. The obtained results demonstrated that the proposed design methodology is suitable for the design of GCFAT cross-sections and beams, providing reasonably accurate and consistent strength predictions. Overall, the potential of geopolymer concrete-filled aluminium tubular cross-sections as a novel cement-free, sustainable, and structurally efficient composite cross-section is demonstrated. © 2023 The Author(s)"

This study simulates the environmental future for attaining the targets of Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7) using the latest datasets. This study is one of the few that empirically explores how various explanatory variables affect CO2 and ecological footprint. The study employed the pool mean group autoregressive distributive lag (PMG-ARDL), fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS), and dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) techniques for the analysis. In the long-run, non-renewable energy and economic growth have a positive impact, whereas renewable energy and remittances have a negative impact on CO2 and ecological footprint. The impact of non-renewable energy on CO2 and ecological footprint is more significant than renewable energy in both the short- and long-run. Most of the variables have a bidirectional causality among each other. This highlights the need for a paradigm shift towards renewable energy in the top recipients specifically for developing countries. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

In this research strand, whether shocks to the time series variable are permanent or temporary is tested via the unit root tests. In this study, based on the theory and empirical works of stochastic convergence, we evaluate the convergence for the BASIC member countries, including Brazil, South Africa, India, and China. We use a variety of methodologies to see whether the convergence of ecological footprint holds for these countries or not. We first use the wavelet decomposition technique to decompose the series into the short run, middle run, and long run, and then we run several unit root tests to confirm the stationarity property of the series. The methodologies implemented in this study allow us to apply econometric tests to the original series as well as to the decomposed series. The results of panel CIPS test demonstrate that the null hypothesis of unit root could be rejected for the short run but not for the middle and long run, implying that long-lasting impact might prevail due to any shocks to the ecological footprint in the middle and long run.

The IBG-DME process was simulated in Aspen plus. Operating at selected condition, the IBG-DME was an exothermic process, whereas for 1 kg h−1 of oil palm trunk, bio-DME of 0.3456 kg h−1 and bio-methanol of 0.015 kg h−1 were produced as main product and by product, respectively, with energy efficiency at 59.5%. The energy consumption increased as gasifying temperature increased and reached thermal self-sufficient condition at approximately 890 °C but the CO2 emission showed opposite trend. LCA result indicated that the carbon footprint of each unit operation relied on the energy consumption. For biomass gasification section, the global warming potential (GWP) accounted for approximately 91% of the total impact. The DME production section highly contributed toward the ozone depletion potential (ODP), eco-toxicity (ET), and human toxicity-non-carcinogenics (HTNC) whereas the syngas cleaning and conditioning section highly contributed toward GWP, human toxicity potential by ingestion (HTPI), and aquatic toxicity potential (ATP). The endpoint impact on the ecosystem were higher than the human health for all process sections. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

Unwarranted clinical variation, i.e. variation in the utilization of health services unexplained by differences in patient illness or preferences, may be an avoidable source of CO2 when related to overuse. Our objective was to evaluate the CO2 emissions attributable to unwarranted variation in the use of MRI and CT scans among countries of the G20-area. Methods: We selected seven countries of the G20-area with available data on the use of CT and MRI scans from the organization for Economic Co-operation and Development repository. Each nation's annual electric energy expenditure per 1000 inhabitants for such exams (T-Enex-1000) was calculated and compared with the median and lowest value. Based on such differences we estimated the national energy and corresponding tons of CO2 that could be potentially avoided each year. Results: With available data we found a significant variation in T-Enex-1000 (median value 1782 kWh, range 1200–3079 kWh) and estimated a significant amount of potentially avoidable emissions each year (range 2046–175120 tons of CO2). In practical terms such emissions would need, in the case of Germany, 71900 and 104210 acres of forest to be cleared from the atmosphere, which is 1.2 and 1.7 times the size of the largest German forest (Bavarian National Forest). Conclusion: Among countries with a similar rate of development, unwarranted clinical variation in the use of MRI and CT scan causes significant emissions of CO2. © 2023"
1367,Convergence of per capita ecological footprint among BRICS-T countries: evidence from Fourier unit root test,Article,Bayraktar Y.; Koc K.; Toprak M.; Ozyılmaz A.; Olgun M.F.; Balsalobre-Lorente D.; Soylu O.B.,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,30.0,2023,63022,63035,10.1007/s11356-023-26532-1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85150623444&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-023-26532-1&partnerID=40&md5=2097b94e329790e61c2c2a200b46fbbf,09441344,Scopus,BRICS-T; Convergence; Ecological footprint; Unit root test,"In recent years there has been a great deal of research into environmental pollution using a variety of techniques in response to growing environmental concerns. Convergence analysis, one of these techniques, helps determine whether the developing countries will catch up with the rich countries in pollution using unit root tests. However, the vast majority of the research in the field has generally used conventional unit root tests. Since many economic series contain structural breaks, using unit root tests that account for structural breaks is essential for accurate prediction. More specifically, if the series has a fractional process, conventional unit root tests may erroneously conclude that the departure from linearity is permanent. Moreover, the existing literature mainly uses gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide, which represent pollution weakly. Therefore, we use per capita ecological footprint (EF hereafter) as a more comprehensive pollution indicator of environmental degradation. In this direction, the study aims to determine whether BRICS-T countries' EF converges to the average of the BRICS-T for the 1992–2017 period. Besides the ADF unit root test, we employed the Fourier ADF unit root test, which considers the structural breaks, and the Fractional Frequency Fourier ADF unit root test, which accounts for structural breaks by considering fractional values. Our results showed that EF converges in Russia and Turkey according to the conventional ADF test, in China and Russia according to the Fourier ADF test, and in Brazil and China according to the Fractional Fourier Frequency test. © 2023, The Author(s)."

The carbon emission of products is mainly determined by the design stage of the life cycle. However, the data in the scheme design stage has certain fuzziness and uncertainty. Therefore, it is difficult to calculate the carbon footprint directly. In this paper, a carbon footprint prediction model of linkage mechanism scheme design stage (CFPL-SDS) is proposed to help designers make decisions. Firstly, the CFPL-SDS is built to quantify the carbon performance of linkage mechanism. Secondly, according to the structural characteristics of the closed-loop cascade rehabilitation robot, a four-finger training mechanism is designed. Finally, the model is applied to the four-finger training mechanism to verify its feasibility. The results show that the CFPL-SDS can calculate the carbon footprint of the linkage in the design stage. Moreover, the CFPL-SDS establishes the mathematical model foundation for the low-carbon optimization problem of linkage mechanism. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

A pertinent climate purpose is being offered based on greenfield investment and financial inclusion to support the energy transition, especially in light of the most recent conference on climate change (COP27). The study employed batteries of techniques to investigate the drivers of carbon footprint in BRICS nations from 2003 to 2018. The results demonstrate that the carbon footprint and its drivers have long-term co-integration linkages. The results of the Pooled Mean Group (PMG) show that, urbanization, greenfield investments and economic complexity represent a constraint to the transition to renewable energy. On the one hand, it is reflected in its positive contribution to enhancing the carbon footprint. Moreover, urbanization has assisted in encouraging renewable energy sources. Based on these findings, it is proposed that the industrial sector takes a more active role in economic complexity to strengthen the BRICS countries' potential for renewable energy and that more investment is made in clean and renewable energy sources. © 2023 International Association for Gondwana Research"

Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and ecological footprint are both used as indicators of environmental degradation, which employs six different models. According to the results found in this study, while trade openness increases CO2 emissions, it decreases ecological footprint in the long-run. Coal consumption raises both CO2 emissions and ecological footprint. While hydroelectric energy reduces CO2 emissions, it has no effect on the environment. The results demonstrate that the EKC hypothesis is correct for both CO2 emissions and Turkey’s ecological footprint. The threshold points are investigated as $18,704, $16,361, and $13,571 in models, where CO2 emissions are the dependent variable. In models where the ecological footprint is the dependent variable, the investigated threshold points of $11,824, $11,821, and $15,476 are higher than the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita during the analysis periods. Furthermore, the findings highlight the importance of renewable energy use in reducing environmental degradation and coal use in increasing environmental degradation. These findings can shed light on the importance of transition to renewable energy sources (i.e., hydroelectricity consumption), from fossil fuels (i.e., coal consumption), related to future planning in energy diversification for Turkey. © 2023, The Author(s)."

These links are investigated using linear and non-linear autoregressive distributive lag (NARDL) techniques. In contrast to the asymmetry results, the symmetric results revealed no cointegration among the variables over the long run. Moreover, asymmetry results from the Y-model indicated that a positive shock in AI significantly affects Y over the long run while raising it over the short term. Furthermore, CO2 rises in the wake of positive shocks like AI, Y, and FR but falls in the wake of adverse shocks. A negative shock to FI raises CO2 temporarily, whereas a negative shock to FR causes CO2 emissions to fall over time. According to the EFP-model, long-term EFP is decreased by both positive shocks to AI and adverse shocks to FR with one-period lags. On the other hand, positive shocks to FI and FR cause the short-term EFP to rise. In addition to a bidirectional causal relationship between Y, EFP, and FI, we found a one-way causative relationship between Y, FR, AI, CO2, and EFP. The FMOLS estimator also supports NARDL estimations. The key recommendations to help Pakistan keep its environment and economy are to enhance green mechanization in agriculture, allocate adequate research and development funds, and initiate integrated environmental and economic growth policies by relevant institutions.

However, the climate and environmental implications of globalized pharmaceutical manufacturing have not been sufficiently understood to inform the integration of key learnings into sustainability practices. Here, we systematically study the environmental impacts of the pharmaceutical supply chain and identify hotspots through a novel analysis framework. Using the case of an HIV drug, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, we demonstrate that improving the solvent recovery rate, innovating the adenine synthesis route, optimizing the adenine yield, and substituting non-renewable heating fuels with renewables can help mitigate the carbon footprint and cumulative energy demand by up to 45%. Carefully optimized pharmaceutical supply chain networks can result in a reduction of up to 9.3% in the life cycle carbon footprint. The majority of carbon emission reductions could be attributed to manufacturing and formulating in regions with deeply decarbonized power grids, rather than reducing the transportation distances between production or formulation sites and raw material or demand zones. Pharmaceutical manufacturers could be incentivized to purchase renewable electricity and source climate pledge friendly raw materials to reduce their carbon footprint. © 2023 American Chemical Society."

However, to determine whether a particular biofuel pathway can achieve decarbonization, its life cycle greenhouse gases (i.e., carbon intensity) must be calculated. The two most important steps in the biofuel life cycle are feedstock production and conversion. When a feedstock is derived from a waste or residue, it can lead to very low carbon intensity for the resulting fuel. Consistency in how waste or residue designations are made is critical, especially when carbon intensities are used in a regulatory context. We develop a taxonomy for feedstock classification, supported by a decision tree for the designation of feedstocks, which may be classified as primary products, co-products, by-products, or wastes. These designations are critical for determining the allocation method by which carbon intensity estimates for feedstocks are calculated under policies such as California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard. The decision tree is designed to include two possible questions as the fifth step, differentiated by the inclusion or exclusion of an economic threshold. An economic threshold is common for distinguishing between co-products and byproducts in biofuel policies. Based on the resulting decision tree, several feedstock candidates are tested, and the results analyzed through a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis to determine if there are specific benefits or drawbacks of the proposed decision tree. The results from the feedstock tests show that the choice of the fifth question does not affect carbon intensity estimates for the selected test cases. However, depending on the economic value of a feedstock, a feedstock could be deemed a byproduct instead of a co-product based on an economic threshold. Choosing to include an economic threshold in the decision process will result in more feedstocks designated as by-products, rather than primary products, thus attributing them a lower carbon intensity. © 2023"

Natural fibers are bio-sourced, biodegradable, have a low carbon footprint, and have interesting mechanical properties. The lightness, tensile strength, and elongation before break make natural fibers suitable candidates to replace synthetic fibers. Sometimes, natural fibers must undergo heavy chemical treatment for the extraction of microfiber. This is not the case in this paper, which presents a first attempt to use esparto fiber in its raw state without heavy treatment without soda and bleach. In this paper, the raw esparto stem cut into short fibers is treated, then prepared and used as reinforcement in mortar. The mechanical properties of the esparto stems were identified, analyzed, and improved. The mechanical tests showed a weak adhesion between the mortar and Alfa. Also, excessive absorption of water by the stem induced a delay in the mortar's setting. Even with unsaturated stems, this phenomenon is observable. An improvement was applied to the natural Alfa stem to improve its adhesion and reduce the absorption of spillage water. For the first time, as a major innovation in natural fibers used for cementitious composites, a method is presented in this paper allowing the use of Alfa (esparto) fiber in a mortar while keeping the mechanical strength properties of the mortar. Test specimens 4x4x16 cm were made and reinforced with short fibers of 2 and 3 cm with different volume concentrations: 1%, 2%, and 5%. The flexural strength and compressive strength were determined experimentally. The results show that for the 1% concentration of short fibers of 3cm, the compressive strength is 26 MPa, which is almost identical to the strength of the control specimen equal to 26.03 MPa. Flexural strength of the improved fibers concentrated at 1%, 2%, and 5% reach nearly 4.75 MPa very close to the flexural strength of the control specimen, which is 5.57 MPa. The flexural strength doesn't decrease with treated Alfa fiber concentration increase: This is a unique case in which flexural strength doesn't decrease compared to other natural fibers results in the literature. In conclusion, Alfa-treated short fibers can be used in secondary structural applications subject to compressive and light bending forces, for example, paving applications. © 2023 by authors, all rights reserved."

Therefore, this study explores the economic growth impact on reducing energy poverty and ecological footprint in the emerging seven economies from 2000 to 2019. Energy poverty is measured using three disciplines: availability poverty, accessibility poverty, and affordability poverty. We applied a new dynamic method, “bias-corrected method of moments estimators (2021),” for long-run outcomes. This study used the environmental Kuznets curve—approach to measure economic growth’s scale effect and technique effect to reduce energy poverty and ecological footprint. Importantly, the study explores the mediating role of politically stable institutions in mitigating environmental and energy poverty. Our findings validate that energy poverty and ecological footprint could not reduce at the initial stage of economic growth. However, the later development stage shows a positive effect on reducing energy poverty and ecological footprint. These results validated an inverted U-shaped Kuznets curve hypothesis for emerging seven. Further, the result found that strong political systems are more quick-witted and have the legislative power to swiftly implement beneficial policies to pull out of the vicious circle of energy poverty. Further, environmental technology significantly reduced energy poverty and ecological footprint. The causality analysis entails that a bidirectional exists between energy poverty, income, and ecological footprint. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Previous studies on carbon emission (CE) of CI, however, are often limited to the quantitative level and provincial or local administrative unit scales, lacking relevant studies at the spatial raster resolution scale, due to data limits. Here, using the energy consumption, social economic data, and a series of remote sensing data from EU EDGAR, this study explored the spatial–temporal distribution and changing characteristics of CEs from CI in typical years of 2007, 2010, and 2012. This study found, from 2007 to 2010, then 2012, in addition to subtle differences, that the direct, indirect, and total CEs of CI all showed an increasing trend overall. In all provincial units except Tianjin and Guangdong, indirect CEs took up more than 50% of the total CEs, which can clearly indicate the “dominant low carbon, recessive high carbon” characteristics of CI. The direct, indirect, and total CEs of the CI in 2007, 2010, and 2012 all showed a positive spatial clustering.

1379,Life Cycle Assessment of Coastal Enhanced Weathering for Carbon Dioxide Removal from Air,Article,Foteinis S.; Campbell J.S.; Renforth P.,Environmental Science and Technology,57.0,2023,6169,6178,10.1021/acs.est.2c08633,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151824394&doi=10.1021%2facs.est.2c08633&partnerID=40&md5=3e495ceacaec5fc538d310af72645bb5,0013936X,Scopus,enhanced rock weathering; enhanced silicate weathering in coastal systems; negative emissions technology; ocean alkalinity enhancement; ocean alkalization,"Coastal enhanced weathering (CEW) is a carbon dioxide removal (CDR) approach whereby crushed silicate minerals are spread in coastal zones to be naturally weathered by waves and tidal currents, releasing alkalinity and removing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Olivine has been proposed as a candidate mineral due to its abundance and high CO2 uptake potential. A life cycle assessment (LCA) of silt-sized (10 μm) olivine revealed that CEW’s life-cycle carbon emissions and total environmental footprint, i.e., carbon and environmental penalty, amount to around 51 kg CO2eq and 3.2 Ecopoint (Pt) units per tonne of captured atmospheric CO2, respectively, and these will be recaptured within a few months. Smaller particle sizes dissolve and uptake atmospheric CO2 even faster; however, their high carbon and environmental footprints (e.g., 223 kg CO2eq and 10.6 Pt tCO2-1, respectively, for 1 μm olivine), engineering challenges in comminution and transportation, and possible environmental stresses (e.g., airborne and/or silt pollution) might restrict their applicability. Alternatively, larger particle sizes exhibit lower footprints (e.g., 14.2 kg CO2eq tCO2-1 and 1.6 Pt tCO2-1, respectively, for 1000 μm olivine) and could be incorporated in coastal zone management schemes, thus possibly crediting CEW with avoided emissions. However, they dissolve much slower, requiring 5 and 37 years before the 1000 μm olivine becomes carbon and environmental net negative, respectively. The differences between the carbon and environmental penalties highlight the need for using multi-issue life cycle impact assessment methods rather than focusing on carbon balances alone. When CEW’s full environmental profile was considered, it was identified that fossil fuel-dependent electricity for olivine comminution is the main environmental hotspot, followed by nickel releases, which may have a large impact on marine ecotoxicity. Results were also sensitive to transportation means and distance. Renewable energy and low-nickel olivine can minimize CEW’s carbon and environmental profile. © 2023 The Authors.

This is achieved by developing a novel use of an iron salt (i.e., FeCl3) in an integrated anaerobic wastewater treatment and mainstream anammox process. FeCl3 was chosen to be dosed in a proposed sidestream unit rather than in a primary settler or a mainstream reactor. This causes acidification of returned activated sludge and enables stable suppression of nitrite-oxidizing bacterial activity and excess sludge reduction. A laboratory-scale system, which comprised an anaerobic baffled reactor, a continuous-flow anoxic-aerobic (A/O) reactor, and a secondary settler, was designed to treat real domestic wastewater, with the performance of the system comprehensively monitored under a steady-state condition. The experimental assessments showed that the system had good effluent quality, with total nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations of 12.6 ± 1.3 mg N/L and 0.34 ± 0.05 mg P/L, respectively. It efficiently retained phosphorus in excess sludge (0.18 ± 0.03 g P/g dry sludge), suggesting its potential for further recovery. About half of influent organic carbon was recovered in the form of bioenergy (i.e., methane). This together with low energy consumption revealed that the system could produce a net energy of about 0.11 kWh/m3-wastewater, assessed by an energy balance analysis. © 2023 American Chemical Society."

Collaborative arrangements in the form of business groups can positively influence sustainable development and environmental ingenuities by adhering to environmental policies and regulations and pursuing environmental orientation as they have a higher political or social visibility. However, such collaborations may negatively influence ecological and carbon footprints as their stronger political legitimacy means that they are less worried about undertaking legitimation activities in the drive toward environmental protection and restoration, such as enhanced sustainable social and environmental performance. This paper adds to the emerging conflicting business strategy and environment literature to resolve whether corporate's collaborative actions protect the environment or further deteriorate it in the form of increased or decreased sustainable social and environmental performance. Using a large sample of 21,086 firm-year observations from 2010 to 2018 in China (the world's biggest polluter), we find a negative and significant relationship between corporate's collaborative actions and sustainable social and environmental performance, implying that such collaborative arrangements have worse sustainable social and environmental performance than non-collaborative (individual) firms. The findings highlight vital guidelines in framing stratagems about ecological protection and restoration and effectively improving the environmental footprints of the firms. Our results constitute the interests of policymakers and controllers concerned with evaluating initiatives pertaining to ecological protection and sustainable development among the collaboratively managed enterprises. © 2022 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

This slow adoption is attributed to South Africa’s energy building regulation, SANS 204, which does not promote energy-conscious commercial property development. Furthermore, it was observed that buildings waste significant amounts of energy as electrical appliances are left on when they are not in use, which can be prevented using innovative technologies. Design/methodology/approach: The researchers attempted to evaluate the impact of innovative technologies through an overarching constructivist mixed-method paradigm. The research was conducted using a multi-case study approach on green buildings which had innovative technologies installed. The data collection took the form of online, semi-structured interviews, where thematic analysis was used to identify emergent themes from the qualitative data, and descriptive statistics was used to evaluate the quantitative data. Findings: It was found that implementing innovative technologies to reduce the energy consumption of commercial buildings could achieve energy savings of up to 23%. Moreover, a commercial building’s carbon footprint can be reduced to 152CO2/m2 and further decreased to 142CO2/m2 through the adoption of a Photovoltaics plant. The study further found that innovative technologies improved employee productivity and promoted green learning and practices. Originality/value: This research demonstrated the positive impact innovative technologies have on energy reduction and the sustainability of commercial properties. Hence, facility managers should engage innovative technologies when planning a commercial development or refurbishment. © 2022, Alireza Moghayedi, Dylan Hübner and Kathy Michell."

Within this scope, e-fuels are considered a potential solution to replace conventional fossil fuels. However, in some cases, their physical and chemical properties are so different that its application in conventional engines is complex. For this reason, this work focuses on the study of oxymethylene ethers (OMEX) as a potential low-carbon fuel alternative. The aim is to improve the understanding of the combustion process of these e-fuels when they replace fossil Diesel in internal combustion engines under equivalent operating conditions. To achieve this objective, a computational fluid dynamics model of an optical compression ignition engine has been developed. The operating conditions chosen are representative of a medium load point of the engine, which coincide with experimental work previously done on this platform. n-Heptane was used as surrogate of fossil Diesel while OMEX was simulated as a simpler mixture of oxymethylene ether molecules. Results show remarkable differences between Diesel and OMEX. This fuel provides lower equivalence ratio fields. Thus, oxidation reactions are promoted in wider areas within the combustion chamber, leading to a faster combustion process. Besides, the soot formation is also drastically decreased in comparison to the other fuel. These results have been corroborated with experimental information. © IMechE 2022."

Recently, an electrochemical process via the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to synthesize ethanol has emerged as a promising alternative approach by directly consuming CO2 from the atmosphere. Despite the fact that numerous remarkable electrocatalysts with fascinating activity, selectivity, and stability have been extensively uncovered in this field, environmental impacts of this technology have rarely been acknowledged. Herein, a life cycle assessment (LCA) study is conducted to evaluate the potential environmental impacts and benefits of an innovative electrochemical process versus conventional biochemical and thermochemical processes toward the sustainable synthesis of 1 kg of ethanol. Impact assessment results revealed that with the contemporary electricity mix, the electrochemical process is still surpassed by the biochemical process, and its environmental benignity is not pronounced, attributed to tremendous electricity utilities accounting for 67.7-100% of impacts. However, it prevails over the two conventional routes when powered by renewable energies, particularly solar energy, with impact reduction ranging from 108.6 to 750.5%, while providing the greatest benefits with respect to terrestrial ecotoxicity (TETP). Carbon footprint further indicates that the electrochemical process becomes competitive and reaches carbon neutrality once driven by electricity with carbon intensity (CI) below 0.25 and 0.12 kg CO2 eq/kWh. Overall, in spite of its massive electricity utilities, the electrochemical ethanol synthesis route is highly promising in environmental impact remediation when coupled with renewable energies, which calls for more efforts from researchers and governments to achieve carbon neutrality and sustainability in years to come. © 2023 American Chemical Society"

The location of the salt cavern is speculative, within possible limits to be found in the salt deposits in the Gulf of Mexico of the USA, as the aim is to demonstrate the technical feasibility of the concept. It presents the conceptual design of the wells used for the solution mining of the caverns and the operation cycle of injection and withdrawal of hydrogen. The contribution of the study presented stems from the methodology adopted in the simulation of the geomechanical structural behavior of the salt cavern and in its design for storing hydrogen, which has thermomechanical properties more complex than natural gas. The numerical simulation considers the nonlinear physical viscoelastic and elastoplastic phenomena, with different constitutive laws for representing the geomechanical behavior of geomaterials. The constitutive laws based on deformation mechanisms are used (multi-mechanisms of deformation – M.D.) to simulate the creep of the salt rock. The article also presents a protocol for sizing the caverns, considering more than 40 years of experience in the design of conventional and solution mining of rock salt. It presents the concept of admissible halite creep strain and safety factors necessary to establish a stress belt that avoids hydrogen leaks at all stages of cavern construction and hydrogen storage. Using this methodology, the authors found that the cavern studied (220 m in height and 95 m in diameter) can hold 11,968,000 kg of working hydrogen. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC"

Materials and Methods: We analysed the expected clinical lifecycle of single-use (Ambu aScope™ 4 Cysto) and reusable (Olympus CYF-V2) flexible cystoscopes, from manufacture to disposal. Performance data on cumulative procedures between repairs and before decommissioning were derived from a high-volume multispecialty practice. We estimated carbon expenditures per-case using published data on endoscope manufacturing, energy consumption during transportation and reprocessing, and solid waste disposal. Results: A fleet of 16 reusable cystoscopes in service for up to 135 months averaged 207 cases between repairs and 3920 cases per lifecycle. Based on a manufacturing carbon footprint of 11.49 kg CO2/kg device for reusable flexible endoscopes and 8.54 kg CO2/kg device for single-use endoscopes, the per-case manufacturing cost was 1.37 kg CO2 for single-use devices and 0.0017 kg CO2 for reusable devices. The solid mass of single-use and reusable devices was 0.16 and 0.57 kg, respectively. For reusable devices, the energy consumption of reusable device reprocessing using an automated endoscope reprocessor was 0.20 kg CO2, and per-case costs of device repackaging and repair were 0.005 and 0.02 kg CO2, respectively. The total estimated per-case carbon footprint of single-use and reusable devices was 2.40 and 0.53 kg CO2, respectively, favouring reusable devices. Conclusion: In this lifecycle analysis, the environmental impact of reusable flexible cystoscopes is markedly less than single-use cystoscopes. The primary contributor to the per-case carbon cost of reusable devices is energy consumption of reprocessing. © 2022 BJU International."

Among these, the United Kingdom has framed the development of shale gas as one means to transition from high-carbon fossil-fuel consumption to low-carbon alternatives. Yet the introduction of this industry and recent legislation associated with it have not been without controversy. Communities throughout the United Kingdom are engaged in sustained debates concerning climate change, health, the scale of extraction footprints, securitisation, and governance. Places such as Kirby Misperton, the focus of this article, are representative of many villages where questions abound about the role of justice at all stages and scales of governmental decision-making. Using a legal geographic lens, this article examines narratives among local residents who are actively resisting the arrival of unconventional gas. I consider how the relationships between and among energy transition, policy, and justice have been interpreted by communities and argue for inequity and risk to be addressed in more transparent ways. I contend that highlighting counter-narratives remains essential if powerful arguments by governments and others are to be negated. Fundamentally, true justice can only prevail when all stakeholders are considered legitimate and their opinions valid. © 2022 The Author.

An effective sorbent provides high oil uptake and retention values, high selectivity, super-fast uptake kinetics, and sufficient mechanical strength to ensure practical application under different conditions. In this regard, synthetic sorbents made up of graphene, carbon nanotubes, and polymers in the form of aerogels, thin films, pads, and non-woven fibers have been widely explored. However, none of them addresses all the attributes of an ideal oil sorbent. Aerogels provide extremely high uptake values, but they are so light that it is difficult for the end user to handle them. On the other hand, thin films and non-woven fibers can quickly absorb oil but suffer from low uptake capacity with low retention values. Similarly, commercial oil sorbent pads have sufficient mechanical strength, but low uptake capacity compared to aerogels. Herein, we present a super oil sorbent with a porous structure using a facile energy-efficient approach. The as-prepared sorbent comprises a porous thin film with micropores and macro-cavities, resulting in super-fast uptake kinetics and a high oil uptake value of 85 g/g. Moreover, tensile test results confirm sorbent's effectiveness in spill response. Lastly, our unique design does not involve expensive hydrophobic functionalization and thus utilizes lower embodied energy and generates lower carbon footprints. © 2022 The Author(s)"

It is observed that such a user-friendly and quick process has hardly been explored to prepare polyolefin-based free-standing porous or nonporous thin films. Herein, we report a free-standing thin film of at least 5μm made from polypropylene using the spin coating technique. Our methodology utilizes lower embodied energy and generates lower carbon footprints than the conventional melt extrusion technique. The thin films prepared from the spin coating technique was investigated with DSC, XRD, SEM, XPS, etc., which suggested the heated thin films showed more crystallinity and strength compared to unheated thin films. The SEM images revealed a fibrous structure with a pore size range from 1-10μm. The tensile strength and modulus of the as-prepared thin films were found to be 7 MPa and 583 MPa, respectively. Also, enthalpy change of 84 J/g and relative crystallinity of 41% were obtained. The as-prepared thin film can be used in various applications with minor modifications, such as in coating layers on the solid surface, porous sorbent, and filtration membrane. © 2022 The Author(s)"

Local governments are eager to have up-to-date information of every aspect of city life, including environmental data, such as air and water quality parameters; mobility data, such as traffic flow, including vehicles, transit passengers; crowd control, such as public events, mobility in hospitals; life quality data, such as social status, education level, health records; etc. Monitoring all these very different data streams in space and time is a formidable challenge. While on the data acquisition side, tremendous progress has been achieved, as sensors have been deployed in increasingly large numbers on both mobile and static platforms, there is a lack of creating accurate geotags, as the quality of georeferencing varies over a large scale. It is important to note that the data acquisition is becoming largely customer-based, as smart devices are efficient sensor systems and with advancing communication technologies, crowdsourcing is quickly becoming the dominant data source on mobile platforms. In this paper, we investigate the potential to exploit the ranging capabilities of imaging and communication sensors and use the strength of the spatial network formed by the sensors to improve the georeferencing of a group of platforms operating in a close environment, such as UAS swarm or a platoon of autonomous vehicles. Transportation in cities and in general mobility are of great interest to Smart Cities, they represent one of the most significant components of the activities, so having an optimized transportation system is essential to reduce carbon footprint, decrease commute time, and just improve the quality of life. To assess the performance of collaborative navigation based accurate georeferencing, data was acquired at a simulated intersection area at The Ohio State University, where multiple vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists were moving around.

In this study, one-part AAB has been synthesized by mixing alternative sodium silicate powder, obtained from rice husk ash (RHA) and metakaolin (MK). The main objective was to verify the effect of MK (two types were used with different reactivity characteristics) and water content on the mechanical properties of pastes and mortars produced with the one-part AAB. Some tests were conducted (e.g. setting times, flexural and compressive strengths, elastic modulus) and the results indicated that the MK type and the water content directly affect different properties. As expected, the decrease in water content decreased the workability of the mortars and improved the mechanical strength. A more reactive MK provided an increase in compressive strength higher than 60%. The results confirm the possibility of producing an alternative sodium silicate powder from RHA dissolution, that when mixed with MK, results in AAB with acceptable compressive strength. This paper reveals that with the correct materials and a good mix design, the properties of this eco-friendly AAB can be considerably improved. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l."
1393,Dynamic and marketing capabilities as determinants of firm performance: evidence from automotive industry,Article,Cataltepe V.; Kamasak R.; Bulutlar F.; Palalar Alkan D.,Journal of Asia Business Studies,17.0,2023,617,638,10.1108/JABS-11-2021-0475,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133170959&doi=10.1108%2fJABS-11-2021-0475&partnerID=40&md5=7810e2da7509cc827050ff2f1f317cf9,15587894,Scopus,Automotive industry; Dynamic capabilities; Emerging markets; Environmental dynamism; Financial performance; International business; Marketing capabilities; Regression analysis; Turkey,"Purpose: This study aims to explore the roles and relations of dynamic capabilities (DCs) and marketing capabilities (MCs) to generate firm performance through new empirical data from the automotive industry in an emerging market, Turkey, where volatile market conditions may compel firms to use both their DCs and MCs. The automotive industry dynamic character, which is shaped by fierce competition among car manufacturers, fluctuating customer demands and strong effect of environmental forces, provides an ideal context for examining the performance outcomes of MC and DC in non-static environments. This study aims to show whether better financial performance can be achieved through an integrated MC and DC framework; if the level of environmental dynamism (ED) influences the utilization of MCs; and the impact of MC and DC convergence on firm performance by using emerging market data, which is rare in the extant literature. Design/methodology/approach: This paper empirically investigates the role of MCs on the relationship between DCs and firm performance and the effect of ED in marketing capability development through a study of 162 top level managers from the automotive industry in Turkey using multiple regression methods. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. A maximum concern was given to obtain at least three questionnaires from each firm to minimize the risk of getting biased answers from only one manager. Findings: The data were analyzed by the regression method, and the mediation and moderation tests were conducted to test the established hypotheses. The direct relationship between MCs and firm performance was examined through linear regression, and a significant relationship was found (ß = 0.408; t = 5.656; p < 0.001). Pricing (ß = 0.404; p < 0.001), marketing research (ß = 0.367; p < 0.001) and marketing strategy and implementation (ß = 0.336; p < 0.001) had the strongest association with firm performance. The mediating role of MC on the relationship between DC and firm performance was assessed, and the analysis result yielded a significant result (ß = 0.439; t = 6.174; p < 0.001). Finally, the moderating effect of ED on the direct relationship between MC and firm performance was assessed. Yet, the interaction term was insignificant (ß = 0.013; t = 0.103; p = 0.918) in predicting firm performance. Research limitations/implications: Although the data set covers a broad range of firms operating in the Turkish automotive industry, the generalization of findings should only be possible through obtaining fresh evidence from other emerging markets that possess the similar market characteristics of Turkey. The cross-sectional nature of the study may offer insights only for a certain period of time; thus, additional longitudinal studies are recommended to see the dynamic changes on the constructs and relationships between them. Future studies may also include qualitative methods, i.e. interviews with top managers to have a deeper understanding on how DC–MC interaction creates better performance. Practical implications: This study empirically shows the importance of MCs for firm performance; thus, managers should allocate significant efforts and resources for improving MCs. The demand for the electric and even autonomous vehicles is likely to increase in the following years, and this new era in the automotive industry requires more R&D and innovation-based products, i.e. green vehicles with low carbon footprint, the use of robotics and long-life batteries for electric vehicles. The cost-related pricing may no longer be a competitive advantage for the firms in emerging markets such as Turkish automotive industry; thus, more investment for disruptive technologies should be considered. Originality/value: The results show that MCs of firms mediated the relationship between DCs and economic performance. Yet, ED did not play a moderating role on the relationships between MCs and performance. It is concluded that DCs were associated with improved firm performance via MCs. Furthermore, the insignificant impact of ED on the development of MCs leading to better performance was explained by firms’ given over-performing efforts in the context of emerging markets. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."

However, it is only estimated by questionnaire or estimated data. We carried out a 180-day direct data tracking for three volunteer families with different demographic characteristics. The results show that consumer behaviors significantly influence the carbon and water scarcity footprint. Moreover, the uncertainty between the test data and the energy label estimated data is revealed. For family 1, the energy label-based electricity consumption carbon footprint is 0.57 kgCO2e, while the empirical data result is 2.79 kgCO2e. We proposed an improved carbon footprint evaluation method with the correction parameters, which can be estimated using the sampling data from the customers. The results show that applying actual data collection and building a database is necessary to reduce the astonishing errors, making error analysis possible and meaningful. © The Author(s) 2022."

The waste created in households is not separated at the source. All waste is accumulated in a single waste bin and stashed in a nearby public waste bin, resulting in a massive amount of waste being dumped in landfills and also infused with other types of waste, causing environmental pollution. The core objective of this research is to develop a household waste segregator using the TensorFlow object detection model and Arduino microcontroller. The SSD MobileNet V2 model has been trained with a household dataset consisting of paper, plastic, metal, organic waste, glass, and one more additional empty class to detect whether waste is placed for detection or not. This proposed system can predict the waste class and segregate it into their specific dustbin with mean Average Precision (mAP) and recall of 86.5% and 88.3%, respectively. Waste segregation and recycling can reduce landfills, lower carbon footprints, increase recycling, recover value from garbage, and lower greenhouse gases emitted from waste. Segregation at the source will reduce the cost of the segregation process carried by the municipal solid waste management. © 2023, Dr D. Pylarinos. All rights reserved."

However, policy implementation intensity and benefits are rarely considered together. Here, combining the changes in the rate of the livestock and fenced area, we constructed a grazing prohibition intensity (GPI) index that reflected the intensity of policy implementation. We also quantified ecosystem service benefits (ESBs), including net primary productivity (NPP) and soil conservation by the different models. Then, a new perspective in combination with ESBs and GPI was used to assess whether a fence layout is appropriate using the four–quadrant model and how to optimize a potentially unreasonable fence layout based on seven drivers. We found that the NPP and soil conservation service notably increased by 59% and 87%, respectively, in the total fenced area, after the implementation of the grazing exclusion program. The high values of ESBs and GPI were concentrated in the eastern and central-eastern regions of the northern Tibet, respectively. Moreover, the potentially unreasonable fence layout accounted for 10% of the total fenced area, and was focused on meadow areas with a high human footprint. The area proportion of reasonable fence layout coupling ESBs and GPI increased by 20% compared with ESBs individually. Finally, an optimal potential unreasonable fence layout might reduce the mismatch between the ESB and GPI by considering countermeasures such as attention to the potential unreasonable fence layout, setting a target for supplying carbon sinks and soil and water conservation quantities and reducing the human footprint. Our study indicates the necessity of linking ESBs and GPI for fence layout management. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

While there are a few examples of non-flexible sensors available, the management of electronic waste generated from such sensors is critical. Most of such available sensors are rigid in form factor and hence limit their usability in healthcare monitoring due to their poor conformity to human skin. Combining these facets, studies on the development of a recyclable cross-talk free flexible sensor for monitoring human motions and active parameters are far and few. In this work, we report on the development of a recyclable flexible sensor that can provide accurate data for detecting small changes in strain as well as pressure. The developed sensor could decipher the signals individually responsible due to strain as well as pressure. Hence, it can deliver a cross-talk free output. Thermoplastic polyurethane and graphene were selected as the model system. The thermoplastic polyurethane/graphene sensor exhibited a tensile strain sensitivity of GF ≃ 3.375 for 0-100% strain and 10.551 for 100-150% strain and a pressure sensitivity of ∼−0.25 kPa-1. We demonstrate the applicability of the strain sensor for monitoring a variety of human motions ranging from a very small strain of eye blinking to a large strain of elbow bending with unambiguous peaks and a very fast response and recovery time of 165 ms. The signals received are mostly electrical hysteresis free. To confirm the recyclability, the developed sensor was recycled up to three times. Marginal decrement in the sensitivity was noted with recycling without compromising the sensing capabilities. These findings promise to open up a new avenue for developing flexible sensors with lesser carbon footprints. © 2023 American Chemical Society"

Objective: To estimate the environmental impacts associated with prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and prostate biopsy. Design, setting, and participants: We performed a cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment of prostate biopsy. Data included materials and energy inventory, patient and staff travel contributed by prostate MRI, transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy, and pathology analysis. We compared environmental emissions across five clinical scenarios: multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) of the prostate with targeted and systematic biopsies (baseline), mpMRI with targeted biopsy cores only, systematic biopsy without MRI, mpMRI with systematic biopsy, and biparametric MRI (bpMRI) with targeted and systematic biopsies. We estimated the environmental impacts associated with reducing the overall number and varying the approach of a prostate biopsy by using MRI as a triage strategy or by omitting MRI. The study involved academic medical centers in the USA, outpatient urology clinics, health care facilities, medical staff, and patients. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Greenhouse gas emissions (CO2 equivalents, CO2e), and equivalents of coal and gasoline burned were measured. Results and limitations: In the USA, a single transrectal prostate biopsy procedure including prostate MRI, and targeted and systematic biopsies emits an estimated 80.7 kg CO2e. An approach of MRI targeted cores alone without a systematic biopsy generated 76.2 kg CO2e, a systematic 12-core biopsy without mpMRI generated 36.2 kg CO2e, and bpMRI with targeted and systematic biopsies generated 70.5 kg CO2e; mpMRI alone contributed 42.7 kg CO2e (54.3% of baseline scenario). Energy was the largest contributor, with an estimated 38.1 kg CO2e, followed by staff travel (20.7 kg CO2e) and supply production (11.4 kg CO2e). Performing 100 000 fewer unnecessary biopsies would avoid 8.1 million kg CO2e, the equivalent of 4.1 million liters of gasoline consumed. Per 100 000 patients, the use of prostate MRI to triage prostate biopsy and guide targeted biopsy cores would save the equivalent of 1.4 million kg of CO2 emissions, the equivalent of 700 000 l of gasoline consumed. This analysis was limited to prostate MRI and biopsy, and does not account for downstream clinical management. Conclusions: A prostate biopsy contributes a calculable environmental footprint. Modifying or reducing the number of biopsies performed through existing evidence-based approaches would decrease health care pollution from the procedure. Patient summary: We estimated that prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a prostate biopsy procedure emits the equivalent of 80.7 kg of carbon dioxide. Performing fewer unnecessary prostate biopsies or using prostate MRI as a tool to decide which patients should have a prostate biopsy would reduce procedural greenhouse gas emissions and health care pollution. © 2022 European Association of Urology"

Current studies have underlined the requirement to shift the company from entrepreneur to ecopreneur with three goals, i.e., social, economic, and environmental sustainability. This paper investigates an economic order quantity model for deteriorating items with partial backordering on integrating the factors that affect the environment and society. Carbon emissions linked to operational activities of inventory can be reduced with the help of investment in green technology. Deterioration is controlled here with the help of investment in preservation technology. Dumping of waste without the proper mechanism has a hazardous effect on society. So, the cost is also included in this study to adopt the appropriate means to dispose of the wastage. Here, imprecise demand with selling price and advertisement cost-dependent demand is considered. This paper provides some theoretical results related to the concavity of the objective function and solution algorithm to obtain the optimal values of decision variables. A numerical analysis is presented to validate the model. Concavity is demonstrated graphically by considering the decision variables in a pair. Results indicate that as the capital investment in preservation technology rises from 3 to 8 units, around 83% and 90% declines in deterioration rate and disposable cost are observed, respectively. Due to the investment in preservation technology, the disposable cost reduces and profit increases to a certain level. A decline of 4% in carbon footprints is observed due to enhancing the investment in green technology by 33%. In the end, sensitivity analysis has been performed and managerial insights have been provided. © 2022 THE AUTHORS"

However, the economic benefits of tourism and globalization could occur at the expense of increased energy consumption (from fossil fuels) and other pollution-intensive activities that worsen environmental degradation, especially in countries with lax institutions and environmental standards. The roles of tourism, globalization, and their interaction term on environmental degradation have not been thoroughly investigated. Hence, this study analyzes the moderating role of globalization on the impact of tourism on environmental degradation (carbon emissions and ecological footprint) in 31 African countries using different dimensions of tourism and globalization. It uncovers the marginal effect of tourism on environmental degradation at different levels of globalization. It utilizes strategies that account for cointegration, dynamism, endogeneity, heterogeneity, cross sectional dependency, and causality. Evidence from this study shows that globalization and its dimensions play favorable moderating roles on the impact of tourism on carbon emissions. The marginal effect of tourism on carbon emissions decreases as globalization increases, suggesting that a simultaneous increase in tourism and globalization can mitigate carbon emissions. However, no evidence to show that globalization can mitigate the environmental impact of tourism on ecological footprint. The findings differ probably because carbon emissions and ecological footprint measure different aspects of environmental degradation. This analysis emphasizes the need for countries to consider the interaction between tourism and globalization in their quest to ensure environmental sustainability.

This study investigates the potential environmental advantages that could be gained by local conversion of wheat straw, a residue of wheat grain – a major cereal crop, to bioethanol in Kermanshah, Iran. To identify and recommend strategies to address the environmental impacts hotspots of 1 MJ wheat straw-based ethanol production and consumption compared with gasoline, a cradle-to-grave (Well-to-Wheel) life cycle assessment using TRACI 2.1 method was conducted. Subsystems considered within the system boundary of this study included wheat straw production and collection, transportation of wheat straw to biorefinery, conversion of the straw to bioethanol and electricity as a byproduct, and distribution and combustion of bioethanol. Results demonstrated that straw production and collection subsystem was the main contributor to the life cycle environmental impacts of the bioethanol in all categories, mainly due to on-farm emissions and electricity consumption for irrigation. Compared with gasoline (93 g CO2 eq/MJ), ethanol production and consumption avoided 55.7 g CO2 eq/MJ. Carbon sequestration during wheat cultivation subsystem and surplus electricity credit generated at the ethanol biorefinery subsystem offset majority of the negative impacts from other parts of the life cycle. An uncertainty analysis was performed in order to evaluate the effect of inherent variation in LCA model inputs of straw production on the carbon footprint of the system. Results indicated that the mean value of GHG emissions from wheat cultivation step is 254 kg CO2 eq/tonne wheat straw, confirming minimum uncertainty exists in our base case scenario. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

However, as they are increasingly challenged by modernization, whether they can keep clean production in a modern society has become a general concern. In this study, we first put forward a theoretical framework for the environmental impact assessment of agricultural heritage systems. Then, we apply it to Qingtian Rice-Fish Culture System (QRFCS), the first Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems in China. We focus on its environmental impact in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and analyze the changes in its capacity for reducing GHG emissions under dual impacts of modernization and conservation measures with the carbon footprint model. Results show that the rice-fish culture has obvious advantages in GHG emission reduction over the rice monoculture in the study area, but it is in face of environmental risks brought by the increased inputs of fertilizers and feed. The environmental impact of QRFCS in terms of GHG emissions has decreased these years, but the risk of the rice-fish industry shrinking has increased due to the negative feedback formed by the low input and low output status. However, the positive aspect is that the moderate land scale management has increased the capacity of QRFCS for reducing GHG emissions and promoted its conservation as an agricultural heritage system. We propose that this theoretical framework and its application results will not only provide suggestions for giving full play to the clean production capacity of agricultural heritage systems, but also provide countermeasures for their conservation in the context of modernization. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature."

In this context, the carbon footprint caused by conducting extended experiments on huge datasets for fine tuning the model parameters is usually ignored. Here, we present an efficient hybrid trust-aware incremental recommendation system that is based on factorization of user-item matrices. The method uses trust networks of the customers obtained from social networks. The main advantage of the method is that it is incremental and there is no need to re-train the system from scratch in presence of new customer activities and only newly added users and items are learned. To tackle the sparseness of the matrix, known as cold-start problem, we employed a deep neural network to decrease the user ratings approximation error. Moreover, we evaluated three different initialization methods for matrix factorization algorithm. The method is evaluated on two versions of popular MovieLens dataset from GroupLens research and also Extended Epinions dataset. The experimental results confirm that our method significantly requires less computational resources, while providing comparable prediction error. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

Nigeria is one of the leading palm oil producers and consumers. A significant challenge of the palm oil industry is to reduce the environmental impacts (e.g. pollution and carbon footprint) and integrate a circular economy in operation. This study aims to comparatively quantify the environmental impacts of technologies used by different mills. We applied a life cycle assessment in the case of Nigeria. The study covers the reception and processing of fresh fruit bunch (FFB) to end-product palm oil. The inputs include generated empty fruit bunch (EFB), mesocarp fibre, palm kernel shell, palm oil mill effluent, diesel, water and all outputs to the environment for a functional unit of 1-tonne FFB. The results showed that large-scale mills perform worse (468 kg CO2-eq per t FFB) than the semi-mechanised and smallholder mills in effects on climate change but better in the other impact categories, including human toxicity, ecotoxicity, and fine particulate matter formation. In large-scale mills, the climate change impacts decrease by 75% when the raw palm oil mill effluent (POME) is used in composting EFB. Similarly, climate change impacts reduce by 44% when biogas from POME substitutes diesel in the semi-mechanised and smallholder mills. We conclude that regulatory measures are needed to ensure improved management practices in the production processes. Particular attention should be paid to the generation and reuse of biomass and POME. This study provides a handy reference to assist the sustainable energy transition in Nigeria’s and other parts of sub-Saharan Africa’s oil palm industry to mitigate climate change and form a cleaner bioeconomy. © 2022, The Author(s)."

A cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment was carried out to assess the environmental feasibility of implementing the current g-C3N4-based photocatalytic CO2 reduction system based on 1 kg CH3OH production. It was observed that the emerging photocatalytic CH3OH system induced 68 and 53% less carbon footprint and fossil usage, respectively, in producing the same amount of CH3OH as compared to the conventional approach. The CO2 reduction reaction step was identified as the main contributor in photocatalytic system, which accounted for more than 50% of the total environmental impact scores. In the conventional system, the score points of global warming and fossil depletion contributed the most by the product purification and desulfurization step, respectively. In addition, sensitivity analysis manifested that the lowest environmental burden of 46.50 kg of CO2 equiv carbon emission and 15.27 kg oil equiv fossil consumption was obtained in the photocatalytic CH3OH system upon replacing fossil-based energy with hydro-powered electricity. These results suggest a potent replacement of the incumbent industry system for the amelioration of climate benefits and resource conservation with the advanced development of the photocatalytic system. © 2023 American Chemical Society."

The wind turbines are invariably using doubly fed asynchronous generator. This paper considers control of a doubly fed induction machine (DFIM). A proportional integral (PI) controller, proportional integral and derivative (PID) and fractional order PID (FOPID) have been proposed for control of DFIM. The controllers have been optimized using bat optimization and antlion optimization (ALO) resulting in optimized control of the system. The controllers enhanced the system response in terms of settling time, rise time and other parameters. However, FOPID controller gave the overall better performance in terms of parameters like rise time, settling time, settling minimum, peak and peak time. The results were obtained using MATLAB.

This has placed tremendous pressure on sustainable global development. Many countries and regions in the world have adopted intensive subsistence cultivation methods when planting maize; however, limited studies exist on these methods. The main purpose of this research is to show the impact of climate change on maize yields and carbon footprint (CF) in South Korea over 10 years, find the proper operating method and promote the advanced combination of inputs for the sustainable development of maize farmers. Design/methodology/approach: This study used survey data from the South Korea Rural Development Administration of 2010, 2014 and 2019 to estimate the CF of maize planting under intensive subsistence cultivation. Life-cycle assessment was used to determine the CF. Farmers were grouped according to significant differences in yield and GHG emissions. Linear regression was used to measure the dependence of the main contributors on the CF production and carbon efficiency. Findings: In South Korean maize planting, N in chemical fertiliser was the most significant contributor to the CF and organic fertiliser was the most significant input. The use of chemical and organic fertilisers significantly affects the production of the CF and carbon efficiency. Households in the high-yield and low-GHG emission groups are more sustainable because they generate the least GHG when producing and earning through maize cultivation. Globally, maize production in South Korea has a relatively low CF and maize production produces fewer GHG. Originality/value: This study provides information for policymakers to determine key operational options for reducing GHG emissions using intensive subsistence cultivation of maize production in South Korea and other countries. © 2022, Zhirun Li, Yinsheng Yang, Namho So and Jong-In Lee."

An efficient logistics network is necessary link to support EPW recycling. This study, therefore, designed a circular symbiosis network for EPW recycling based on urban symbiosis strategy. The treatment of EPW in this network includes reuse, recycling and replacing. An optimization model with multi-depot collaboration combining material flow analysis and optimization methods was developed and a hybrid non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) was designed as technical support for designing the circular symbiosis network while quantitatively assessing the economic and environmental benefits of the network. The results show that the designed circular symbiosis option has better resource saving and carbon footprint reduction potential than both the business as usual option and circular symbiosis option without service collaboration. In practice, the proposed circular symbiosis network can save EPW recycling costs and reduce carbon footprint. This study provides a practical guideline for the application of urban symbiosis strategies to help urban green governance and the sustainable development of express companies. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

Results show that key common emission sources are electricity sector, non-metallic mineral products, and smelting and processing of metals in Shandong and Hebei. However, key common motivation sources are the construction sectors in Guangdong, Henan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shandong. The key inflow regions include Guangdong and Zhejiang and key outflow regions include Jiangsu and Hebei. The emission reductions are attributed to the emission intensity effect of the construction sector; contrastingly, the emission increase is from the investment scale of the construction sector. Here, Jiangsu could be a key target for future emission reduction because of its high absolute emissions and low past reduction. The scale of investment in construction might be a significant factor in reducing emissions in Shandong and Guangdong. Henan and Zhejiang could concentrate on sound new building planning and resource recycling. © 2023 American Chemical Society."

Globally, tufa architecture and depositional details are poorly understood as most described tufas have been degraded by weathering and erosion. In the hyperarid Atacama, post-depositional alteration is negligible, therefore, the exceptional preservation of Santa Juana tufas documented in this study provides new information about tufa facies and their complex interactions. Santa Juana facies include microbial stromatolites, phytoherms, cascadestone, flowstone and porous limestone. Phytoherms, consisting of former plant stems coated with calcite, developed in channels, within pools, and along spring discharge aprons. Cascadestone, representing former waterfalls, preserves microbial filaments and delicate V-shaped calcite crystals. Flowstone lines shallow subvertical to subhorizontal channels, representing sites of rapidly sluicing water flow. Porous limestone, containing sparse calcite and/or gypsum and anhydrite cement crystals, represents detrital accumulations. Stable isotope results, coupled with U/Th ages, show that by the Quaternary, relative to the Neogene, groundwater was less supercharged with volcanogenic CO2 so degassing was moderated. The δ18O ratios from Miocene–Pliocene palustrine and lacustrine freshwater carbonates that underlie Santa Juana tufas indicate significant evaporation, but the tufa δ18O signal indicates a less evaporative trend due to shorter atmosphere exposure time. Biological fractionation in δ13C is largely masked by the region's volcanogenic carbon footprint, although tufa petrography shows well-preserved microbial filaments and laminations. The range of tufa ages in this study shows that there were wetter time periods within the drainage basin headwater area in the Quaternary, but that by the late Pleistocene to early Holocene, aridity to hyperaridity became established. The lack of diagenesis or alteration within the Santa Juana tufas indicates that there has been minimal rainfall since their deposition. © 2022 The Authors.

Narrative literature review. Objective. The aim of this study was to review published literature discussing sustainable health care and to identify aspects that pertain to spine surgery. Summary of Background Data. In recent years, research has investigated the contribution of surgical specialties to climate change. To our knowledge, no article has yet been published discussing the impact specific to spinal procedures and possible mitigation strategies. Methods. A literature search was performed for the present study on relevant terms across four electronic databases. References of included studies were also investigated. Results. Spine surgery has a growing environmental impact. Investigations of analogous specialties find that procurement is the single largest source of emissions. Carbon-conscious procurement strategies will be needed to mitigate this fully, but clinicians can best reduce their impact by adopting a minimalist approach when using surgical items. Reduced wastage of disposable goods and increased recycling are beneficial. Technology can aid remote access to clinicians, and also enable patient education. Conclusions. Spine-surgery-specific research is warranted to evaluate its carbon footprint. A broad range of measures is recommended from preventative medicine to preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative spine care. Level of Evidence. 5. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

The effect of hot isostatic pressing, also followed by a T6 treatment, was analyzed in comparison with samples in the as-cast, annealed and T6 conditions. Furthermore, the effect of the innovative high-pressure T6 was investigated. It was found that the hot isostatic pressing is able to ensure densification of the alloy with an increase in both hardness and energy absorbed during impact. The T6 treatment performed at atmospheric pressure after the hot isostatic pressing is able to increase hardness and peak force. At the same time, the innovative high-pressure T6 is able to ensure similar results than those of hot isostatic pressing followed by T6, leading to a significant decrease in the treatment duration and costs and reducing the carbon footprint of the manufacturing process. © 2023, Gruppo Italiano Frattura.

This study utilized life cycle assessment and carbon footprint methodologies to assess these environmental impacts. The objectives of the investigation were pursued using the ReciPe 2016, Cumulative Energy Demand, Cumulative Exergy Demand approaches, and sensitivity analysis. The outcomes of the endpoint analysis revealed that damage to resources, human health, and ecosystems received more than 98% of the total impact due to electricity consumption. Furthermore, electricity consumption and COD were responsible for the most significant midpoint-level consequences. The sensitivity analysis showed that a change of approximately 20% in electricity and chemical oxygen demand had the most significant impact on the ozone depletion category. The primary gas emitted as a result of the wastewater treatment process was carbon dioxide, which accounted for 99.78% of the carbon footprint associated with the process. Based on these findings, it can be inferred that replacing the current energy source with renewable alternatives would reduce over 90% of the environmental impacts of the wastewater treatment process in these industrial units. © ️2023 Advances in Environmental Technology (AET)."

The project will have zero carbon dioxide emissions and will be powered by clean energy sources. Therefore, a study was designed to understand which clean energy sources might be a better choice. Because of its nearly carbon-free footprint, nuclear energy may be a good choice. Nowadays, the development of very small modular reactors (vSMRs) is gaining attention due to many salient features such as cost efficiency and zero carbon emissions. These reactors are one step down to actual small modular reactors (SMRs) in terms of power and size. SMRs typically have a power range of 20 MWe to 300 MWe, while vSMRs have a power range of 1–20 MWe. Therefore, a study was conducted to discuss different vSMRs in terms of design, technology types, safety features, capabilities, potential, and economics. After conducting the comparative test and analysis, the fuel cycle modeling of optimal and suitable reactor was calculated. Furthermore, the levelized unit cost of electricity for each reactor was compared to determine the most suitable vSMR, which is then compared other generation SMRs to evaluate the cost variations per MWe in terms of size and operation. The main objective of the research was to identify the most cost effective and simple vSMR that can be easily installed and deployed. © 2022 Korean Nuclear Society"

The Sarawak Inland Water Transport System (IWTS) has become an essential tool for its residents due to its geographical location. They have access to basic facilities along the rivers’ tributaries through their water transportation. Currently, undeveloped IWTS in the Rajang River has become a navigation safety issue depending on the type of vessel, with insufficient navigational aid installed in certain areas. The nature of the inadequacy of navigation safety can be daunting as it can lead to loss of life, damage to the environment, disruption of operations, injuries, and a long-term environmental impact, often causing severe consequences. This study assessed navigational safety on the Rajang River and recommended appropriate improvements based on the most recent specification requirements of the International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities (IALA) (IALA, 2009). The 3D area simulation of navigation marks will be developed using Sketch-Up Software based on satellite image data. The data was then analysed using Risk Assessment (Fuzzy-AHP technique) to propose the most appropriate aids for navigation and their placement. The proposal and design of aids in navigation for Tanjung Rajang River will increase safety and security for the shipping industry, increase turnaround time, and help maintain a zeroaccident rate. © Penerbit UMT"

The ARDL results reveal that several factors such as energy consumption, financial development, urbanization, globalization, foreign direct investment, and population growth have a positive relationship with the ecological footprint in developed countries. On the other hand, the human development index and natural resources negatively affect the ecological footprint in developed countries. Moreover, the ARDL results indicate that energy consumption, financial development, urbanization, foreign direct investment, and population growth positively impact the ecological footprint in developing countries in the long run. In contrast, the human development index, natural resources, and globalization have a negative impact on the ecological footprint.

Land sparing involves conserving forest while growing timber in intensively managed areas. On the other hand, land sharing utilizes ecological forestry approaches, but with a larger management footprint due to lower yields. While the sparing-sharing framework has been widely tested and debated in agricultural settings to balance competing values, such land-allocation strategies have been rarely studied in forestry. We examined whether a sparing, sharing or Triad strategy best achieves multiple forest objectives simultaneously. In Triad, management units (stands) in forest landscapes are allocated to one of three treatments: reserve (where conservation is the sole objective), intensive (timber production is the sole objective) and ecological (both objectives are combined). To our knowledge, ours is the first Triad study from the temperate zone to quantify direct measures of biodiversity (e.g. species' abundance). Using a commonly utilized forest planning tool parameterized with empirical data, we modelled the capacity of a temperate rainforest to provide multiple ecosystem services (biodiversity, carbon storage, timber production and old-growth forest structure) over 125 years based on 43 different allocation scenarios. We then quantified trade-offs between scenarios, taking into account the landscape structure, and determined which strategies most consistently balanced ecosystem services. Sparing strategies were best when the services provided by both old-growth and early seral (young) forests were prioritized, but at a cost to species associated with mid-seral stages, which benefitted most from Triad and sharing strategies. Therefore, sparing provides the greatest net benefit, particularly given that old-growth-associated species and ecosystem services are currently of the greatest conservation concern. Synthesis and applications. We found that maximizing multiple elements of biodiversity and ecosystem services simultaneously with a single management strategy was elusive. The strategy that maximized each service and species varied greatly by both the service and the level of timber production. Fortunately, a diversity of management options can produce the same wood supply, providing ample decision space for establishing priorities and evaluating trade-offs. © 2023 The Authors.

Discarded cigarette filters (CFs) cause significant harm to the environment but have good recycling potential for solar steam generation. In this study, an efficient thermally-positioned material (AC-CF), which uses renewable cellulose acetate CFs and an acetylene carbon black (AC) coating as an absorber, was developed for application as a solar steam generator. The AC-CF exhibited superhydrophilic characteristics and extensive solar absorption (approximately 100%). These properties enable the resulting AC-CF to exhibit rapid water transport and a strong photothermal conversion ability, with an outstanding evaporation rate of 1.81 kg m−2 h−1 under 1 sun illumination. The evaporator can remove most impurities and dye molecules during outdoor operation. Subsequently, the AC-CF evaporator was dissolved and recycled using N, N-dimethylformamide, and the recycling method yielded good results. This method for preparing absorbers reduces manufacturing costs and guides the potential practical application of recycled polymer resources using discarded CFs. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."

Moreover, institutional quality can directly or indirectly influence public debt and environmental quality. However, empirical investigations probing the moderating role of institutional performance in public debt and environmental degradation relationship are missing. This research pursues to bridge this gap by exploring whether the institutional quality is a factor that moderates the debt-environment relationship of OIC economies in the period 1996 to 2018. Short-run findings disclose that public debt statistically significantly degrades the environment quality in the panels of low and overall OIC-income countries, but it mends the environmental performance in the high-income panel of OIC countries. Institutional performance is negatively linked with all environmental damaging measures across the three-income stratum of OIC countries. Both the short-run and long-run results of the interactive term between public debt and institutional quality reveal that it turns the unfavorable influence of public debt on environmental damaging measures. The outcomes of the study validated an inverted U-shape EKC when CO2, CH4, and ecological footprint are employed in all three-income panels of OIC countries. However, for N2O emission, a U-shaped EKC is seen in the panels of low-income and overall OIC nations. To address environmental issues, our results suggest that OIC countries should improve the institutional quality and control the public debt at a certain level, also ensure sustainable use of biocapacity and forests. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Considering that fossil fuel consumption is one of the main factors causing environmental degradation, altering the energy consumption patterns of nations toward clean energy can be a suitable solution. For this purpose, this study investigates the impact of energy consumption structure (ECS) on the ecological footprint from 1990 to 2017. This research includes three steps: First, the energy consumption structure is calculated using the Shannon–Wiener index. Second, from 64 countries with middle- and high-income levels, the club convergence method is used to identify countries with similar patterns in an ecological footprint over time. Third, using the method of moments quantile regression (MM-QR), we examined the effects of ECS in different quantiles. The results of club convergence show that the two groups of countries with 23 and 29 members have similar behavior over time. The results of the MM-QR model show that for club 1, the energy consumption structure in quantiles of 10th, 25th, and 50th has positive effects on the ecological footprint, while in 75th and 90th are negative. The results of club 2 indicate that the energy consumption structure has positive effects on the ecological footprint in quantiles 10th and 25th, but negative effects on 75th. Also, the results show that GDP, energy consumption, and population in both clubs have positive effects, and trade openness has negative effects on ecological footprint. Considering that the results indicate that changing the structure of energy consumption from fossil fuels to clean energies improves the environmental quality, so governments should use incentive policies and support packages for the development of clean energy and reduce the costs of installing renewable energy. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Based on the IPAT model (environmental impact (I) is decomposed into three elements: population (P), affluence (A, economic growth), and technology level (T)), this paper empirically explores the validity of the green information and communication technology (GICT)–induced environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. The research applies a quantile regression (QR) that tests over 95 countries’ panel data for the period 2000–2017 by using six types of ecological footprint (EF) as environmental degradation indicators and environmental regulations (ERs) as interaction variables. We confirm the vital role that GICT plays in lessening cropland, forest area, and grazing land, while increasing its impact on built-up land. Additionally, the findings partially support the existence of an inverted U-shaped GICT-induced environmental EKC hypothesis for a decreasing impact on cropland, forest area, and grazing land via consideration of non-market-based ER as the interaction term. GICT does not notably reduce carbon-absorption land usage; however, improvements of GICT and non-market-based ER in those nations have been accompanied by lower environmental degradation. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

This study tests this relationship in context of high, moderate, and low material footprint sub-samples; these samples are formed utilizing the expectation–maximization machine learning algorithm. Using the panel data set of EU-27 countries from 2000 to 2020, linear and non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) are applied for the symmetric and asymmetric evidence and to test environmental Kuznets curve (EKC), linear ARDL with the quadratic function is included. Results of the symmetric relationship find evidence of resource productivity’s impact on the environmental degradation. In full sample of EU-27, both symmetric and asymmetric methods show that the short run and long run increase of resource productivity lower the environmental degradation. Only long run asymmetric relationship in high material footprint subsamples supports that the resource productivity controls environmental degradation. Results of moderate material footprint sub-sample are mixed. However, low material footprint countries show that resource productivity in long run controls the environmental degradation in symmetry and only positive resource controls productivity in short run in asymmetric relationship. The reason for mixed results is the quadratic nature of sub-samples. EKC hypothesis is validated in moderate and low material footprint sub-samples. This research has many policy implications. © 2023, The Author(s)."

It has a large portfolio of success cases in computer vision. In the past years, diverse inception flavours, differing in the number of branches, the size and the number of the kernels, have appeared in the scientific literature. They are proposed based on the expertise of the practitioners without any optimization process. In this work, an implementation of population-based incremental learning is proposed for automatic optimization of the hyperparameters of the inception module. This hyperparameters optimization undertakes classification of the MNIST database of handwritten digit images. This problem is widely used as a benchmark in classification, and therefore, the learned best configurations for the Inception module will be of wide use in the deep learning community. In order to reduce the carbon footprint of the optimization process, policies for reducing the redundant evaluations have been undertaken. As a consequence of this work, an evaluation of configurations of the inception module and a mechanism for optimizing hyperparameters in deep learning architectures are stated. © 2022 The Author(s)."

Less is known about the footprints of popular diets as they are consumed by US adults, and thus the potential trade-offs with diet quality for free-living individuals. Objectives: This study estimated the carbon footprint and diet quality of popular diets as selected by a nationally representative sample of US consumers, including the recently trending keto- and paleo-style diets. Methods: The 2005–2010 NHANES 24-h recall data were used to categorize individual adult diets (n = 16,412) into 6 types: vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian, paleo, keto, and all other diets, referred to here as omnivore diets. Average daily greenhouse gas emissions in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents per 1000 kcal (kg CO2-eq/1000 kcal) were calculated for each diet by matching our previously developed database to NHANES individual diet data. Diet quality was determined using the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) and the Alternate Healthy Eating Index. Survey-weighted ordinary least-squares regression was used to assess mean differences in diets. Results: The average carbon footprints of vegan (0.69 ± 0.05 kg CO2-eq/1000 kcal) and vegetarian (1.16 ± 0.02) diets were lower (P < 0.05) than those of the pescatarian (1.66 ± 0.04), omnivore (2.23 ± 0.01), paleo (2.62 ± 0.33), or keto (2.91 ± 0.27) diets. Mean HEI scores were highest for pescatarian diets (58.76 ± 0.79) and higher (P < 0.05) for vegetarian (51.89 ± 0.74) than for omnivore (48.92 ± 0.33) or keto (43.69 ± 1.61) diets. Conclusions: Our results highlight the nuances when evaluating the nutritional quality of diets and their carbon footprints. On average, pescatarian diets may be the healthiest, but plant-based diets have lower carbon footprints than other popular diets, including keto- and paleo-style diets. © 2023 The Authors"
1427,Identifying the roles of energy and economic factors on environmental degradation in MINT economies: a hesitant fuzzy analytic hierarchy process,Article,Yilanci V.; Candan G.; Shah M.I.,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,30.0,2023,55768,55781,10.1007/s11356-023-26142-x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149732257&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-023-26142-x&partnerID=40&md5=317ed453a400d02b3d3737e0f91c486e,09441344,Scopus,Analytic hierarchy process; Energy; Environmental degradation; FDI; MINT; Urbanization,"Globally, research communities have been studying the different determinants of environmental degradation or pollution using different contexts and methods. In this study, we identify several energy and economic factors, such as energy consumption (EC), gross domestic product (GDP), energy production (EP), urbanization (URB), and foreign direct investment (FDI) as the most effective factors of environmental degradation by obtaining several environmental researchers’ opinions and using the hesitant fuzzy analytic hierarchy process. In the later stage of the analysis, we use these variables as regressors of the ecological footprint (EF) as a proxy for environmental degradation. Since we find evidence of cross-sectional dependence among the members of the variables, we use second-generational panel tests. First, we test the stationarity of the variables using the cross-sectionally augmented IPS (CIPS) panel unit test. The results show that the regressors have different orders of integration. So, we employ the Durbin–Hausman panel cointegration test to test the existence of a long-run relationship between the variables. Having found a long-run relationship, we estimate the long-run coefficients using the common correlated effects mean group estimator, which reveals that energy consumption has an increasing effect on the EF in Indonesia and Turkey, while energy production has a negative impact in Mexico and Turkey. While GDP has an increasing effect in all countries, FDI has a similar effect in only Indonesia. Moreover, URB decreases the ecological footprint in Nigeria, while it increases in Turkey. Our approach to the evaluation of environmental degradation can be generalized to other regions as well as where there is a significant need to understand the roles of different drivers on environmental degradation or pollution.

Most previous contributions rely on CO2 emissions as a measure of environmental damage, whereas using disaggregated ecological footprint allows us to consider resource consumption and waste generation compared to nature's resource generation and waste absorption. The empirical application is based on a panel data analysis for G7 countries from 1980 to 2018. The results indicate that the EKC hypothesis is confirmed for the ecological footprint overall, but the impact of GDP growth is unequal across its components. Long-term elasticities point to renewable energy generation significantly improving environmental sustainability. Globalization also decreases pollution indicators, while economic complexity seems to contribute to environmental degradation. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

Empirical analyses were carried out using panel corrected standard error (PCSE), an estimation technique by Beck and Katz, Am Polit Sci Rev, 634–647, (1995). The results suggest that development, defined by a more holistic index, has significant positive impact on CO2 emissions, but negative impact on ecological footprint among economies in the sub-region. The results further show that effective governance, corruption control and regulatory quality tend to minimize adverse impact of development on CO2 emissions, all other things being equal. Additionally, the study finds that political instability exacerbates the adverse effect of development on CO2 emissions. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

The aim is to reduce both the hospital's carbon footprint and waste handling costs. Hospital environmental waste services staff do not audit pharmaceutical waste bins as this requires the presence of a registered pharmacist. Aim: Since previous published studies of healthcare waste disposal practices have not included pharmacy waste bin audits, this study aimed to investigate waste disposal behaviours in a hospital pharmacy department. Method: This sequential, two-phase mixed methods study was conducted in a metropolitan, tertiary public hospital's pharmacy department in Queensland. Phase I involved semi-structured interviews of hospital pharmacists and pharmacy technicians while Phase II comprised bin audits of the pharmacy department's waste streams. Results: The bin audits revealed 36.1%, 23.8%, and 4.9% of recyclable waste in the clinical waste stream for each of the three bin audits respectively. In the general waste stream, the two bin audits of this stream revealed 14.3% and 44.4%, respectively. The reasons were identified in the interviews: there were no recycling bins in the main dispensing areas and there was confusion surrounding correct disposal of original containers and non-contaminated packaging waste. Non-paper waste was found in the confidential (shredded) waste stream in the two bin audits of this stream (10.1% and 16.7%, respectively). Conclusion: Provision of commingled recycling bins and clean office paper waste bins in dispensing areas and education of staff on correct waste segregation processes will improve waste segregation in hospital pharmacy departments with both financial and environmental benefits for the hospital and the general population. © 2023 The Authors.

Irrigated agriculture increases food security yet has controversial implications for global climate change. Most previous studies have calculated carbon emissions and their composition in irrigated areas using the engineering approach to life-cycle assessment. By combining life cycle assessment (LCA)-based carbon emissions accounting with econometric models such as multiple linear regression and structural equation modeling (SEM), we conducted an interdisciplinary study to identify the influencing factors and internal mechanisms of the carbon footprint (CFP) of smallholder crop cultivation on irrigation reform pilot areas. To this end, we investigated corn and potato production data in the 2019–2020 crop years for 852 plots of 345 rural households in six villages (two irrigation agriculture pilot villages and four surrounding villages as controls) in Southwest China. The crop CFP in the irrigation agriculture pilot areas was significantly lower than in non-reform areas. Irrigation reforms mainly impacted the crop CFP through four intermediary effects: the project (implementation of field irrigation channels), technology (improving adoption of new irrigation technologies), management (proper irrigation operation and maintenance), and yield effects. All effects inhibited the CFP, except for the project effect that promotes carbon emissions. Among them, yield increase has the greatest impact on reducing CFP, followed by management and technology effects. Furthermore, planting practices, individual characteristics, and plot quality significantly impacted the crop CFP. This study has policy implications for understanding the food security–climate nexus in the food production industry. © 2023 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences"

With steady economic growth, each province has proposed specific policies aimed at cleaner production. However, the interactions between regions and the complex linkages between industries have hindered the implementation of the “double-carbon” policy. In order to address this issue, we introduced a complex network framework with multiple industries at a national level. The framework aimed to clarify whether there is fluctuation diffusion in China’s multi-province multi-industry carbon emission system, to identify key industries and regions, and to answer the question of “who” is the most effective in governance. The results showed that the fluctuations of industrial carbon emissions had a cross-regional diffusion effect in China indeed. The diffusion capacity of industry fluctuation depends on whether the industry is located at a “hub” position in the network. Hub industries with strong capacity can spread the carbon emission fluctuation of themselves and upstream or downstream industries to the whole country through regional interactions. This characteristic of the hub industry should be taken into account in governance to maximize the effectiveness of emission reduction. Shandong and Inner Mongolia, as important provinces for the production of intermediate products and energy chemicals in China, had a greater role to play in global carbon supply push from their hub industries than in the demand pull. The pulling capacity of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region to the national carbon demand side was greater than that of Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta. These findings might have implications for environmental and economic policymaking, particularly with regard to cross-provincial coordinated systemic solutions and policy anchors for synergy with industries. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

It is critical to improve the lifetime mileage of electric vehicles’ batteries for reducing the cycle life cost and carbon footprint in green transportation. In this paper, a long-life lithium-ion battery is achieved by using ultra-long carbon nanotubes (UCNTs) as a conductive agent with relatively low content (up to 0.2% wt.%) in the electrode. Ultra-long CNT could realize longer conductive path crossing active material bulks in the electrode. Meanwhile, the low content of UCNTs can help to minimize conductive agent content in electrodes and obtain higher energy density. The film resistance and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) confirmed that the use of UCNTs could markedly enhance electronic conductivity in the battery. The battery’s life and life mileage can be prolonged by almost half due to the superior electronic conductivity of UCNTs. The life cycle cost and carbon footprint are also significantly reduced, which could markedly increase economic and environmental performance.

Geopolymer concrete (GPC) has been found a viable alternative for recycling industrial waste. The efficient use of these wastes in geopolymer concrete reduces environmental pollution. In the study, three industrial wastes were utilized for making geopolymer concrete at ambient temperature. These wastes are fly ash, ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS), and two different ceramic polishing waste (CPW). The study proposes fly ash as the primary binder. GGBS is projected as the additive for ambient curing, and CPWs as a recycling binder. The alkali activators Na2SiO3 and NaOH were used to manufacture the concrete mixture consisting of three binders. Important GPC factors such as workability, mechanical strength, sorptivity, water absorption, acid resistance, and chloride resistance have been examined. Further Carbon footprint is also measured to know the environmental impact. The findings revealed an improvement in capillary porosity and chloride permeability with the increase of CPWs upto 20%.

The system consists of the following stages: flocculation, pre-filtration, and ultrafiltration based on filter tubes. The degree of contamination of the rinse waters before and after the treatment process was assessed by means of physicochemical and microbiological tests, and then compared with the permissible parameter values for wastewater discharged into the ground or water. Thanks to the use of flocculation and appropriate ultrafiltration, the high level of total suspended solids and total organic carbon was reduced, which allows for safe discharge of purified water into the environment.

The novelty of the present study lies in formulating a natural doping concept over the conventional techniques to facilitate the photocatalytic properties of the proposed sustainable construction material. To assess the structural performance of the prepared cementitious material, i.e., cement mortar, different physical (porosity, water absorption, and density) and mechanical (compressive strength, flexural strength, and split tensile strength) properties were performed. The results show that the cement mortar mixture FB5F having 15% (10% FA and 5% BS) proportion of conventional cement performed better in terms of workability and durability than other mix designs. Also, the stability and potency of the Fe–TiO2 composite were analyzed using FESEM, EDS, elemental mapping, UV–vis DRS, and XRD. The characterization tests confirmed the iron-titanium (ITO) bond formation with shifting TiO2 from UV to visible light spectrum (Eg = 2.52 eV). The Fe–TiO2 composite was also subjected to an antibacterial check using an aliquot of E. coli bacterial suspension. The composite attained an E. Coli count of about 0.541 log reduction at the end of 45 min and thus, exhibited bacterial disinfection quality. Thus, the Fe–TiO2 composite material proposes an eco-friendly concept which satisfies the requirement for a sustainable and low carbon footprint future which can additionally be used to treat different indoor and outdoor organic contaminants. © 2022"

1438,INVESTIGATION OF PERFORMANCE OF NANO SILICA CEMENT ADDITIVE ON SULPHATE ATTACK IN GEOTHERMAL WELLS,Article,Luswata G.N.; Onyancha D.; Thuo J.N.,African Journal of Applied Research,9.0,2023,1,19,10.26437/ajar.31.03.2023.01,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85180184157&doi=10.26437%2fajar.31.03.2023.01&partnerID=40&md5=108905298f767f2756dd56a05189eaca,24087920,Scopus,Cement-elongation; ettringite; permeability; porosity; sulphate attack,"Purpose: This research was intended to evaluate Nano silica as an additive to improve the sulphate resistance of cement used in geothermal wells. Design/ Methodology/ Approach: Sulphate resistance was determined by measuring the longitudinal change in cement cube specimens that were cured in sodium sulphate solution for 21 days. Cube specimens with varied concentrations of Nano silica (0%, 0.3%, 0.6%, 0.9% and 1.2%) were used in the study. Five separate solutions were maintained at 23℃, 40℃, 65℃, 70℃ and 80℃ for 21 days. Final length measurements were taken and compared as a percentage of initial length measurements. Findings: Beyond 65℃, the sulphate resistance of cement improved for each percentage concentration of Nano silica replacement. Control specimens with 0% Nano silica had the most inferior performance at all temperatures. Higher concentrations of 1.2% and 0.6% Nano silica replacement gave the most resistance between 23℃ and 65℃. A lower concentration of 0.3% proved more suitable between 65℃ and 80℃. Research limitation: The results of the experiment indicate performance in low-temperature geothermal wells. Practical implication: The application of this additive can improve the durability and strength of the cement, reducing the potential for degradation due to exposure to sulphates. This can lead to a longer lifespan of the geothermal well, reducing maintenance costs and increasing its overall efficiency. Social implication: Improved cement designs that create longer-lasting cement sheaths can be developed from this research, thereby fostering geothermal energy development. The option to replace certain volumes of cement with Nano silica contributes to a reduction of the carbon footprint by minimising the demand for, and therefore the production of cement. Originality/ Value/ Novelty: Previous research that tested cement at high temperatures analysed mechanical resistance. This research examined the sulphate resistance of cement at high temperatures. © African Journal of Applied Research."

However, few empirical studies have looked at the influence of industrialization-driven economic transition on carbon footprint in developing nations using a non-parametric approach. In this milieu, on the ground of Kaya’s identity and the novel multivariate quantile-on-quantile regression (QQR) (extension of Sim and Zhou’s (2015) bivariate QQR model), the present research studies the impact of industrial value-added (IGVA), population, energy intensity, and carbon intensity on CO2 emissions in India. This study is one of the first in the literature to evaluate the industrialization-carbonization nexus in the context of Kaya’s identity for the Indian economy utilizing an innovative multivariate QQR approach, which makes a methodological and empirical addition to the literature. The outcomes of the multivariate QQR technique demonstrate that economic and environmental development requires continual long-run strategies. The empirical findings revealed that there is no authentication that India’s carbon emissions increased due to its industrialization, which exhibited that IGVA has a negative and significant connection with CO2 emissions. In some quantiles, population size positively impacts CO2 emissions. On the other hand, carbonization in the Indian economy is asymmetrically affected by GDP per capita and energy and carbon intensity. The quantile Granger causality study further supported the aforementioned results. The current analysis also offers policy suggestions for environmentally friendly sustainable economic growth and to achieve the sustainable development goals (SDGs) of India. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

As native herbivores in the world's grasslands, steppes, and savannas are progressively being displaced by livestock, it is important to ask whether livestock can emulate the functional roles of their native counterparts. While livestock and native herbivores can have remarkable similarity in their traits, they can differ greatly in their impacts on vegetation composition which can affect soil-C. It is uncertain how these similarities and differences impact soil-C via their influence on microbial decomposers. We test competing alternative hypotheses with a replicated, long-term, landscape-level, grazing-exclusion experiment to ask whether livestock in the Trans-Himalayan ecosystem of northern India can match decadal-scale (2005–2016) soil-C stocks under native herbivores. We evaluate multiple lines of evidence from 17 variables that influence soil-C (quantity and quality of C-input from plants, microbial biomass and metabolism, microbial community composition, eDNA, veterinary antibiotics in soil), and assess their inter-relationships. Livestock and native herbivores differed in their effects on several soil microbial processes. Microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) was 19% lower in soils under livestock. Compared to native herbivores, areas used by livestock contained 1.5 kg C m−2 less soil-C. Structural equation models showed that alongside the effects arising from plants, livestock alter soil microbial communities which is detrimental for CUE, and ultimately also for soil-C. Supporting evidence pointed toward a link between veterinary antibiotics used on livestock, microbial communities, and soil-C. Overcoming the challenges of sequestering antibiotics to minimize their potential impacts on climate, alongside microbial rewilding under livestock, may reconcile the conflicting demands from food-security and ecosystem services. Conservation of native herbivores and alternative management of livestock is crucial for soil-C stewardship to envision and achieve natural climate solutions. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

In this context, multiple regression, ADF, PP, FMOLS, Bayer-Hanck co-integration tests are employed in order to examine both the effect of independent variables on dependent variables and the long-run relationship. According to results of multiple regression, FMOLS analysis and Bayer-Hanck co-integration test, trade liberalization, sea transportation, economic growth, energy consumption have substantial impact on CO2 emissions and there is a long-run relationship among variables from 1980 to 2021 for Mexico which verifies the EKC hypothesis. All empirical evidence demonstrates that the Mexican government should take radical steps to prevent environmental degradation. The presence of trade liberalization and the positive movement of the ecological footprint reveal the increasing effect of growth on carbon dioxide emissions, especially in a developing country such as Mexico, which aims for more economic growth. All these indicate the necessity of switching to practices aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions. In this sense, incentives for renewable energy sources, rate differentiation in motor vehicle tax, and regulations in the tax system for negative externalities are some of the applications that can be done. In addition, public expenditures for green infrastructure such as low-carbon energy production and energy efficiency in public buildings can be increased, investments can be made in R&D studies to support innovation, and activities can be preferred to increase environmental awareness. Besides, there are various sea transport green solutions in order to reduce emissions and pollution in maritime transport. Green energy suggest solutions such as reducing the cruise speed of the ship, reducing the use of fossil fuels, choosing new generation fuel types with cleaner content, increasing energy efficiency, and making a weather-dependent cruise plan. © 2023, Econjournals.

We propose an ordinary least square (OLS) and fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS) model to estimate the result. The OLS estimators of the balanced panel data on the aggregate sample and six subgroups of ecological area evidence some key findings. These are: (i) There is a significant positive linear relationship between economic growth (EG) and ecological footprint (EF); however, the relationship between EG and biocapacity (BC) is nonlinear. (ii) Among the subgroups that build up the land, samples depict a linear relationship with EG in EF and BC cases. (iii) Other than carbon-absorbing land and grazing land in the subgroup of EF, all other subgroups against environmental sustainability parameters show a nonlinear relationship with EG. (iv) The inverted U-shape curve is evident in Asian countries in explaining the relationship between EG and ES, and the impact of development indicator (GDP) on ecological subgroups is heterogeneous. The cointegration tests of the FMOLS model suggest the existence of a long-term relationship between the variables. Finally, the empirical observations show a growing trend of ecological deficit in Asia and advocate rapid policy development for environment-friendly economic development. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."

The building and construction sector is responsible for significantly increasing the carbon footprint and linear material consumption. The identification and prioritization of end-of-life solutions during the decommission of the existing pre-cast concrete buildings enable the carbon footprint and linear material consumption to be alleviated. The CE targets enable end-of-life solutions for structural or non/structural components to be identified, while multi-criteria decision analysis enables their prioritization using a hierarchically structured decision model. A principal challenge, therefore, is to identify the assessment criteria for such a prioritization, aligning with the CE targets, and to develop an assessment framework. This manuscript demonstrates how to prioritize end-of-life solutions using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The decision hierarchy has been developed using the end-of-life solutions given in research findings within the structural and/or non-structural components. The decision hierarchy development, AHP prioritization, and sensitivity analysis enable practitioners to integrate the suggested approach with building information modeling (BIM). This enhances the potential for the effective integration of the CE economic model in the construction industry and to minimize the carbon footprint. © 2022 The Authors.

The scale of this problem spawned research to explore the potential for structurally efficient non-prismatic geometries to reduce the amount of concrete used in building elements substantially, thus also reducing their embodied carbon dioxide footprint. In particular, the research focused on segmented thin concrete shells as floor slabs, leveraging computational design and digital fabrication methodologies to automate their production off site. An important part of this research was the development of a computational framework for the design of thin concrete shells in order to make such a construction methodology accessible to building designers in practice. The framework combines solutions for parametric modelling, finite-element analysis, isogeometric analysis, form-finding and optimisation, along with embedded fabrication constraints specific to the project's automated manufacturing system. The application of the developed computational framework in the design of a 4.5 m × 4.5 m prototype is documented in this paper, illustrating how automating concrete construction can transform the industry towards net-zero. © 2023 ICE Publishing.

However, the use of cement resulted in high cost and high carbon footprint. Utilizing bottom ash, a by-product from electricity power plant, as a green stabilizer material is of interest. This paper studied the effect of bottom ash and ground bottom ash on the properties of cement stabilized soft Bangkok clay. The variables included initial water content, clay/binder ratio, cement/BA ratio, and curing time. The unconfined compressive strength test, scanning electron microscope, cost, and CO2 emission were assessed. The results showed that the strength decreased with the increase in initial water content because of the bleeding effect and poor particle bonding. The mixes with 10%BA and 10%GBA achieved the highest 7-day and 28-day strengths for all clay/binder ratios. The strength of sample with GBA was higher than that with BA due to the higher reactivity of the GBA. For BA, the mixes with 60clay/40binder exhibited sufficient strength passing the Thailand's Department of Highways requirement for cement column materials. In the case of GBA, the lower binder content mix with 70clay/30binder met the strength requirement. According to the SEM analysis, the improvement of the matrix was observed and confirmed the higher pozzolanic reaction of GBA and the resulting higher strength from the higher surface area. This research thus showed that the cement-BA could be used as a low-cost and low-carbon binder for the stabilization of clay. © 2022, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals."

However, in previous works, the cost and carbon reduction potential of geographically dispersed data centers with renewable generations is not fully explored due to the difficulty in matching renewable generations with stochastic incoming jobs. In this paper, the temporal and spatial variability of the carbon footprint and electricity price is revealed. Integrated with the distributed characteristics of renewable generations and geographically dispersed feature of the data centers, the carbon emission reduction potential of data centers with renewable generations is explored, leading to triple uncertainties in electricity price, fuel mix and renewable generation. To navigate such a potential, a virtual queue algorithm is designed, which makes online strategies for job scheduling of the data centers. By introducing historical correction terms, high-precision matching of the workload and renewable generation can be achieved with triple uncertainties. This leads to the economic and environmental friendliness of the proposed mechanism, which can achieve OðpT Þ expected regret and ffiffiffiffi constraint violation. Simulations based on real-world data from several states of Australia demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in cost and carbon emission reduction with triple uncertainties. © 2022 IEEE."

Therefore, this research is designed to probe the impacts of economic policy uncertainty (EP), natural resources rent, energy structure, economic growth, and total factor productivity on EF. The annual data for 1995–2018 is analyzed by adopting second-generation methods. The empirical results from the CS-ARDL unveiled that EP is significantly and positively related to EF, indicating that EP is not environmentally friendly in these nations. A 1% increase in EP contributes to EF by 0.025% in the long run. In addition, the results show that natural resource rents and energy structure positively contribute to mitigating EF by 0.012% and 0.095% respectively, while economic growth increases EF by 0.237%. Based on the empirical results, this work suggests addressing the economic policy uncertainty and economic progress to lower ecological deprivation can be a viable solution to attain sustainable development goals. This work recommends adopting feasible economic policies with sound efforts. For this purpose, the economic sector has to be strong enough with sustainable production.

This perspective focuses on the emissions enabled by providing inputs to production processes, and is relevant for discussion of sustainable work and the carbon impact of investment and financial portfolios. We compute the downstream carbon intensity of primary inputs for 35 industries in France using the multi-regional input–output database EXIOBASE. We provide a detailed picture of enabled emissions, disaggregating those by industry and primary inputs. On average, capital inputs are more carbon intensive than labor inputs. Finally, we couple downstream carbon intensities with an extensive national survey on wages to obtain a distribution of the income-based emissions of employees. Income-based emissions are much more unequally distributed than wages due to the huge variability of carbon intensity across industries: a truck driver enables far more emissions than a social-care worker. Inequalities in emissions do not strongly interact with economic inequality. Yet they are gendered because women work disproportionately in low-carbon-intensive industries such as healthcare. As a result, women contribute less to GHG emissions than their wage share would seem to indicate. © 2023 by the International Society for Industrial Ecology."
1450,Testing the validity of disaggregated agricultural-induced growth–environmental pollution nexus in selected emerging economies,Article,Appiah K.; Appah R.; Barnes W.; Darko E.A.,International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology,20.0,2023,3687,3702,10.1007/s13762-022-04217-5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130160032&doi=10.1007%2fs13762-022-04217-5&partnerID=40&md5=1cce4f81af730ff845fb989b7139dae1,17351472,Scopus,Agricultural induced; Carbon dioxide emissions; Economic growth; Environmental Kuznets curve,"Assessing the impact of agriculture on climate change is more complex. Undeniably, agriculture production and its decisive role as a determinant of carbon footprints are of particular interest for analyzing the link between carbon dioxide equivalent emissions (CO2eq) and economic growth. On this basis, our study empirically examines the cogency of disaggregated agriculture-induced environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) in selected emerging states using panel data for the period 1971–2013. This study uses Pooled Mean Group and Common Correlated Effect Mean Group estimation methods to detect the possible changes in the causal relationship and also to obtain the parameters for the explanatory variables. The results show that all the variables have the expected sign and are highly significant. The study clearly shows the existence of cubic polynomial or N-shaped EKC for CO2eq emissions. However, the non-cumulative agriculture-induced EKC test shows no changes in the relationship between economic expansion and emissions from the conventional EKC test in a cubic form. Nonetheless, the idiosyncratic agriculture-induced EKC test modifies the nonstructural variable in the analysis. To elucidate problems posed by homogeneity assumption in the conservative Granger causality test, the Dumitrescu–Hurlin panel causality test was performed to check for the direction of causation. Our study ostensibly advocates for policies that will ensure the efficient application of agricultural practice to reduce emissions from livestock production. Hence, there is the need to promote sustainable economic expansion policies, which are environmentally friendly. This study recommends stricter environmental policies, such as the carbon tax, command, and control measures. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Iranian Society of Environmentalists (IRSEN) and Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University."
1451,The environmental consequences of blockchain technology: A Bayesian quantile cointegration analysis for Bitcoin,Article,Polemis M.L.; Tsionas M.G.,International Journal of Finance and Economics,28.0,2023,1602,1621,10.1002/ijfe.2496,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100158426&doi=10.1002%2fijfe.2496&partnerID=40&md5=8e60b33f6b45723c4a0029be69a3877c,10769307,Scopus,Bayesian analysis; Bitcoin; blockchain; carbon emissions; energy load,"In recent years, there is a widespread belief among researchers and academicians that Bitcoin usage is imposing an additional burden on the environment inducing climate change. Although several studies have focussed on issues related to the energy consumption of the basic cryptocurrencies, an open question remains regarding the environmental depiction of Bitcoin. By resorting to Bayesian analysis and quantile cointegrated vector autoregression (CQVAR), this study seeks to disentangle the driving forces that shape the carbon footprint of Bitcoin. The sample used in the empirical analysis consists of a daily panel dataset covering 50 countries over the period 2016–2018. The empirical findings corroborate a causal effect between the use of Bitcoin and its underlying carbon dioxide emissions generated by the increasing energy load. The CQVAR is associated with positive marginal posterior means for most of the covariates of the model across all the estimated quantiles. In contrast, there is a negative and statistically significant relationship between Bitcoin miner's revenue and carbon emissions, uncovering a multimodal distribution pattern of the marginal posterior densities which is stronger at higher than in lower quantiles. This finding suggests that the lower (higher) miner's Bitcoin revenues, the more abrupt (gradual) the effect on environmental degradation. Therefore, a sustainable energy strategy focussing on the penetration of renewable energy sources along with the use of energy-efficient mining hardware will alleviate the carbon footprint of Bitcoin. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
1452,When does upcycling mitigate climate change? The case of wet spent grains and fruit and vegetable residues in Canada,Article,Jain S.; Gualandris J.,Journal of Industrial Ecology,27.0,2023,522,534,10.1111/jiec.13373,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146083129&doi=10.1111%2fjiec.13373&partnerID=40&md5=3007a57c59b0ec3bbd3aa347a7df7cae,10881980,Scopus,carbon emissions; circular economy; food waste; industrial ecology; life cycle assessment; upcycling,"We investigate when upcycling—defined as treating food by-products for human consumption—mitigates climate change. Earlier research only modeled pilot-scale upcycling experiments, which discount its real-world complexity. To tackle this important limitation, our research involved 130 interviews, life cycle assessment, and a simulation to assess what operational structures made upcycling environmentally sustainable and superior to alternatives such as animal feeding, anaerobic digestion, composting, and landfilling. We considered wet spent grains and fruit and vegetable residues in Canada, two important streams of unavoidable residuals in Western food systems. First, we found that the simulated range of greenhouse gas impacts, +938 to −465 kg of CO2 eq. emissions per tonne of upcycled material, was more optimistic than the ranges available in the literature. No previous estimates existed for the range of impacts for real cases, −18 and −300 kg of CO2 eq. emissions per tonne of upcycled material. Second, net-negative carbon impacts were achieved only by operational structures with a technological configuration characterized by a total energy consumption lower than 1500 kWh per tonne of upcycled materials and a geographical scale inferior to 260 km (from point of collection to point of sale). Most of the real cases identified during our fieldwork matched these operational prescriptions and achieved a carbon footprint up to 25% smaller than the carbon footprint of the substituted virgin products. Third, our analysis of both best-case simulated performance and real performance suggested that the positive carbon impact of upcycling was roughly comparable with that produced by animal feeding and anaerobic digestion, but superior to composting and landfilling. Our study illuminates the anatomy of environmentally sustainable upcycling operations and problematizes emergent food recovery hierarchies. © 2023 by the International Society for Industrial Ecology."

Herein, we report the synthesis of Ni nanoclusters (NCs) of below 2 nm highly dispersed on N-doped carbon using a Ni/Zn bimetallic metal-organic framework (MOF) precursor. The size and the content of the Ni catalyst can be effectively controlled by varying the Ni:Zn ratio in MOF precursors. The −NH2 group in MOF ligand critically influences the size of Ni catalyst, as well as the property of the carbon substrate. At the optimum ratio of 1:150, Ni NCs with an average size of 1.9 nm anchored on pyridinic N-rich carbon were obtained after MOF pyrolysis. The resultant catalyst exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency for CO (FECO, 98.7%) and considerable partial current density for CO (JCO, −40.4 mA·cm−2) at −0.88 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Benefiting from the synergistic effect of small Ni clusters and their optimal interaction with the carbon support, the catalyst displays exceptional long-term stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations carried out for the three model structures confirm that Ni NCs anchored on N-doped carbon facilitate the easier formation of *COOH intermediate and faster electron transfer rate compared with the large-sized Ni particles represented by Ni(111) and the N-doped carbon without Ni.

Air entrainment capacity has been studied indirectly as a measure of heat resistance of concrete. Literature has suggested that mineral admixtures improve the air absorption in the paste component of the concrete, on the one hand, whereas they perform pore and grain size refinement, on the other, thereby reducing the air entrainment. CBA, which being porous, creates the possibility of air adsorption by the aggregate component. Therefore, the study finds out whether a double benefit of adding both of these materials will be achieved, or CBA will try to improve the deficiency in the air entrainment created by the mineral admixtures. Design/methodology/approach: Air-entrained concrete (AEC) mixes were constituted in three groups. First group represents mixes with natural fine aggregates only, and second with 25% fine aggregates substituted by CBA. Progressively, the third group has 50% fine aggregates substituted with CBA. In all the three groups, cement was substituted with FA and SF @ 0%, 20% and 40%, and 0%, 5% and 10%, respectively, thereby creating four binary and four ternary mixes corresponding to each group. Compressive and flexural strength tests were conducted at 28 days on the concrete mixes pre and post high-temperature heat treatment, i.e. 100°C, 200°C and 400°C, respectively. This study also examines the microstructure characteristics of AEC after 14 days of curing via X-ray diffraction. Sorptivity test was also conducted to estimate the capillary and air-entrained voids in concrete. Findings: It was found that a concrete mix containing 20% FA and 10% SF along with 50% CBA could give similar post-heated strength to a normal (without mineral admixtures) AEC. In AECs where only CBA is present and cement paste is not substituted, both of the pre- and post-heated strengths of concrete reduce. Also, some mixtures containing large amounts of mineral admixtures in concrete with nil CBA show a high reduction in post-heated strength though they show good pre-heated strength. Therefore, mineral admixtures and CBA complement each other in improving the post-heated strength. Air pore structure found from sorptivity test also verifies these results. Originality/value: AEC is very helpful for insulation of buildings during summer season by absorbing heat waves. AEC containing FA and CBA reduces carbon footprint because of substitution of cement and it also helps to conserve natural resources by the use of CBA in place of fine aggregates. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Using organic solvents in solvent-based ink is responsible for fire hazards, volatile organic compounds emission, and increasing extra printing costs. The current study aimed to replace solvent-based ink with water-based ink to reduce volatile organic compound emissions and carbon footprints in gravure printing without affecting overall printing quality in order to fill a research gap because none of the studies were reported as best of all authors' knowledge. The polyethylene terephthalate film was printed by laser engraved cylinder having reduced engraving cell depth compared to electronically engraved printing cylinders which result in less consumption of printing ink, hence reducing the raw materials consumption. The cost of printing one kg of polyethylene terephthalate film with water-based ink was reduced by 1.85US$, and volatile organic compounds emissions were reduced from 3373 ppm to 2478 ppm compared to solvent-based ink. The use of water-based ink also reduced the carbon footprint by 3.04 kg. The current study shows that strict implementation of water-based ink has a high potential for saving the cost and reducing the emission of volatile organic compounds, which are very dangerous to the ambient environment, humans, and society. This study's outcome will help prepare the benchmark for green manufacturing systems in gravure printing applications to improve the environment and humanity.

However, there is a dilemma due to the exclusiveness between representing trade-offs in the transition paths and connecting the calculated results to the assessment of downstream food products. Here, this paper proposes a procedure to resolve the dilemma. Methods: The dilemma-resolving procedure is to partition product footprint changes into yield and environmental improvement effects in the same unit as the product footprint. After specifying a typology of transition toward agricultural sustainability, the partitioning procedure was developed on the basis of mapping from a two-dimensional space (area-based indicators) to a one-dimensional space (product-based indicators). To demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of the partitioning procedure, this paper applied it to the three categories of agricultural system transitions, including those to organic agriculture, integrated production, and production systems involving new agricultural inputs such as microbial inoculants and biostimulants, using the cases of the impact category of global warming (carbon footprint). The transition dataset (matched pairs) was constructed using a bibliographical survey. Results and discussion: The results indicate that the partitioning procedure is effective and has good performance: (1) it was able to apply to all the cases in the dataset and to classify all the cases into six specified transition types; (2) it was differentiable between the three transition categories; and (3) it was able to explain the features of each transition category. These results imply that the perspective on agricultural system transitions can be integrated with the perspective on food value chains. Therefore, productivity-environment trade-offs during the research and development phase of agricultural technologies can be linked to environmental mitigation practices along the food value chains. Conclusions: The results imply that, by applying the partitioning procedure, the recent agricultural policy framework contained two exclusive perspectives can be explained consistently. Every stakeholder related to agricultural policy making should be explicit about product-environment trade-offs during agricultural system transitions, as well as about food value chain sustainability. The partitioning procedure facilitates such stakeholder practices. © 2023, The Author(s)."

To assess such trade-offs, discipline-specific models typically used in isolation need to be integrated to support decisions. Integrated modeling approaches, however, usually remain at the conceptual level, and operationalization efforts are lacking. Here, we propose an integrated model and framework to guide the assessment and engineering of technical, socio-economic, and environmental aspects of low-carbon technologies. The framework was tested with a case study of design strategies aimed to improve the material sustainability of electric vehicle batteries. The integrated model assesses the trade-offs between the costs, emissions, material criticality, and energy density of 20,736 unique material design options. The results show clear conflicts between energy density and the other indicators: i.e., energy density is reduced by more than 20% when the costs, emissions, or material criticality objectives are optimized. Finding optimal battery designs that balance between these objectives remains difficult but is essential to establishing a sustainable battery system. The results exemplify how the integrated model can be used as a decision support tool for researchers, companies, and policy makers to optimize low-carbon technology designs from various perspectives. © 2023 The Authors.

These reinforcement techniques require excavation and recompaction of the soil at the site. The primary objective of this research is to investigate the application of an in situ form of reinforcement with relatively small carbon footprint than other renovation techniques that can be adopted without excavation in the form of micropiles. An experimental and numerical study was conducted with a square footing on the sand confined by miniature aluminum micropiles. Finite element analysis using ABAQUS was validated from the acquired experimental data, and a parametric study was performed to analyze the effect of the slenderness ratio, depth ratio, proximity ratio, spacing, and inclination of the micropiles. The results obtained from this study reveal that the inclination of micropiles has little effect on the ultimate vertical load. As the slenderness ratio of micropiles is progressively decreased from 40 to 20, the bearing capacity improves by around 27%. Installing micropiles nearer to the footing edge provided approximately 76% improvement with respect to the unreinforced footing. © 2022, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals."

The internal cooling of the blades is made by ceramic cores in their casting process, but conventional ceramic molding has long reached its maximum possible geometrical complexity, hence shedding light on 3D printing of these cores. The objective of this study is to develop low-viscous, fully stabilized, commercially viable ink for vat-photopolymerization of silica-based ceramics. This paper investigates the best dispersion type and amount for different formulated monomer mixtures, and explains the best correlation between viscosity, solid loading, binders, dispersants, peeling forces and mechanical properties, and offers an optimized mixture to avoid the common ceramic printing issue, namely crack propagation of cores during sintering. Among five dispersant agents, the SOL20, SOL24 and FA4611 exhibited better performance than other dispersion agents, and the optimum concentration level for each binder and dispersant agent was ensured through sedimentation test. Their dispersion capability and long-term stability were further investigated to designate the best dispersion agent for each binder system. Further verification was made by sedimentation study of the samples at 40 °C for 40 days and reducing the superficial area of the used powder mixture. According to the result of the rheology analysis, the best dispersions were achieved using SOL20 for the loaded binder mixtures of M1 and M4, SOL24 for M3and FA4611 for M2. The instability of M1 and M2 with their respective dispersant agent was coordinated through the thixotropic agent of TX/2, and complete stabilization and near-Newtonian behavior were achieved. However, the research showed that the addition of TX/2 to fully stabilized M4 and M2 suspensions negatively impacts the mixtures’ rheological behavior from near-Newtonian to shear-thickening. In the final stage of this study, peeling forces, sintering and three-point bending tests were conducted to determine the final formulated suspension to print ceramic core components. M4 and SOL20 combination was selected for SiO2-ZrSiO4 loading and dispersing, respectively. The impact of solid loading between the range of 58 and 65 vol% on the rheological behavior of the final suspension and the mechanical properties of sintered bodies were investigated to assign an optimum solid rate. The adequate strength on sintered and degree of viscosity for ceramic vat-polymerization processing was achieved at 58 vol%. Lastly, a validation study is conducted by printing a complex ceramic core model by a commercial LCD hobby printer. This validation shows the significance of this study to scale up the manufacturing of complex-shaped ceramic cores and to revolutionize the sector, by printing inexpensive and readily available irregular-shaped (non-atomized) ceramic powder, using the most cost-effective LCD printers (non-specialized expensive ceramic printers). © 2022"

There were two different mixing procedures employed. Initially, a traditional mixing process was utilized, in which the slag was mixed in with the other concrete proportions directly. The slag was then soaked in water before being added to the other concrete elements, which was a novel mixing process. The present study includes 5 different percentages of slag by replacement of cement (0%, 2.5%, 5%, 10%, 20%). In the aspect of concrete compressive strength, the novel mixing method showed a favorable sign when compared to the traditional mixing method. For a 1-h immersion of 2.5% slag in water, highest compressive strength was determined. The maximum value at 2.5% slag immersion for a period of 1 h was fixed, and further cement replacement using fly ash in traditional mixing mode was studied. The study used fly ash percentages of (0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%). The optimum mix's mechanical performance was compared to the control mix and the mix that corresponded to GGBS's traditional mixing mode. Various experiments were also carried out, including sorptivity, water absorption, and the Rapid Chloride Penetration Test, and the performance of the three mixes was examined. XRD and SEM analysis was also performed on the optimum mix and mix of traditional mixing mode were compared in the study. By limiting the use of GGBS, the novel mixing method has not only increased the mechanical strength of the mix, but it has also reduced the carbonation depth, which is a severe problem when it comes to the durability of concrete structures. In addition to reducing carbonation depth with slag, the use of fly ash lowered carbon footprint, achieving the criterion for sustainability. © 2022, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals."

Methods: Seven-day isocaloric (8368 kJ) diet models were created taking into account the Mediterranean, Atkins (20/40/100), Ornish, Zone diets, and Turkey Dietary Guidelines-2015 recommendations with different food and nutrient contents. Water footprints were evaluated using the global water footprint standards. Greenhouse gas emissions were evaluated using carbon footprint factors compiled as a result of meta-analyses of life cycle analysis studies in the literature. In addition, the quality of diets was evaluated with the Diet Quality Index-International. Results: Atkins20 diet model had the most harmful environmental impact (greenhouse gas emissions 8.74 kg CO2-eq/per/day and total water footprint 7731 L/per/day), whereas Ornish and Mediterranean diet models (greenhouse gas emissions 2.2/3.07 kg CO2-eq/per/day and total water footprints 3184/3675 L/per/day, respectively) had less harmful environmental impact. The highest Diet Quality Index-International score was in the Ornish diet model while the lowest Diet Quality Index-International was in the Atkins20 diet model. Conclusion: Ornish and Mediterranean diet models had less harmful environmental impacts, which contributed to sustainable nutrition. The importance of diet quality and environmental impacts should be kept in mind when evaluating diet models to ensure sustainable nutrition. © 2022 Dietitians Australia."

The conventional puddled transplanted rice (CT–TPR) was recorded significantly higher grain yield (4043 and 4129 kg ha−1) and straw yield (6271 and 6379 kg ha−1) than wide bed transplanted rice (WBed–TPR) treatments. The improvement in the grain yield was about 4.39% and 4.03% under CT–TPR than WBed–TPR during 2019 and 2020. The highest total water footprint (TWFP) was observed under CT–TPR, whereas WBed–TPR (0.44 kgm−3) yielded the greatest water productivity (WPIRRI), respectively. The highest net profit, B: C ratio and soil health indicators, i.e., particulate organic carbon (POC), total organic carbon (TOC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) in soil, were also recorded maximum in WBed–TPR than CT–TPR respectively. Among the nutrient management practices, with the applications of recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF), farm yard manure (FYM), phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB), Azatobactor and zinc worked synergistically and increased grain yields by 53.4, 51.3, 47.9 and 46.2% over their respective control. The improved soil health status, i.e., POC, TOC and MBC in soil, was highest with (N9) organics practices @ FYM (30 t ha−1) + PSB (5 kg ha−1) + Azotobacter 20 kg ha−1 + ZnSO4 25 kg ha−1. The highest TWFP was observed with N1 (control) and N2 (100% RDF + ZnSO4 25 kg ha−1), while lowest was found in N9 (organic practices), respectively.

Brazilian governmental programs like ROTA 2030 and RenovaBio drive the research and development of highly efficient engines fueled with biofuels, like sugarcane bioethanol, that has a near to zero carbon footprint. Some technologies such as gasoline direct injection, variable valve train, and turbocharging were implemented in downsized Spark Ignition (SI) engines in order to reach higher thermal efficiencies and decrease CO2 emissions. Homogeneous lean combustion in SI operation can improve fuel consumption and reduce exhaust gas emissions. However, it is limited by combustion instability and the three-way-catalyst (TWC) inability to work properly converting nitrogen oxides (NOx). With lean combustion the NOx emissions could be significantly reduced, enabling the use of lean NOx trap (LNT) as an effective lower cost after treatment system. To explore the limits of homogeneous lean combustion in SI engines, experimental tests were performed to investigate performance, efficiency, combustion, and emission parameters of a multi-cylinder Ford 1.0l Ti-VCT EcoBoost engine fueled with hydrous ethanol. Hydrous ethanol is a commercial Brazilian fuel which has greater laminar flame speed and higher dilution tolerance than gasoline, and thus can increase combustion stability. Different fuel direct injection strategies were explored at part load (below 8.0 bar IMEP) at engine speed of 1500 rpm. Air-to-fuel ratio was varied from stoichiometric (lambda 1.0) to lambda 1.5. The limit of stable homogeneous lean combustion (COVIMEP ≤ 3.0%) was achieved in lambda 1.4. The lowest indicated load of 2.1 bar IMEP was limited by combustion stability at lambda 1.3. The maximum indicated efficiency was 36.9% at indicated load of 8.0 bar IMEP and lambda 1.4. The NOx emissions dropped below 1.4 g/kWh at 4.0 bar IMEP and lambda 1.4. © IMechE 2022."

To do so, unlike the existing literature, we follow a different path. Firstly, we test the environmental convergence (EC) hypothesis using the Phillips and Sul, Econometrica 75(6): 1771-1855, (2007) methodology. Then, we examine the impact of globalization and energy consumption on the ecological footprint (EF), and test the existence of the EKC hypothesis using the dynamic ordinary least squares mean group (DOLSMG) estimator. The convergence test results indicate that OECD countries do not converge to the same steady-state levels with regard to EF levels. However, we identify two convergence clubs that converging to a different steady-state equilibrium. The results of DOLSMG reveal that the EKC hypothesis is valid for both convergence groups. Furthermore, the impact of energy consumption and globalization on EF is higher for club 2, which includes developing countries. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Design/methodology/approach: The autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL), canonical cointegration regression (CCR) and fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS) models are used in the paper. Findings: A long-run relationship is found between climate change and rice production in India. Results report that ecological footprint and carbon footprint spur long-term rice production. While rainfall boosts rice crop productivity in the short term, it has a negative long-term impact. Further, the findings of ARDL models are validated by other cointegration models, i.e., the FMOLS and CCR models. Research limitations/implications: This study provides insights into the role of ecological footprint and carbon footprint along with climate variables in relation to rice production. Originality/value: In the literature, the effects of ecological and carbon footprint on rice production are missing.

1469,The ecological impact assessment of globalization dimensions and human capital: a dynamic approach in the case of selected fossil fuel-rich countries,Article,Alfalih A.A.,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,30.0,2023,47712,47726,10.1007/s11356-023-25655-9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147581029&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-023-25655-9&partnerID=40&md5=58c34b34da0b14e64616be8dee34a08b,09441344,Scopus,Ecological footprint; Economic globalization; Human capital; Political globalization; Social globalization,"The aggravation of climatic damage, the rise in pollution, and global warming have prompted investigation of factors leading to the increase in human demand on natural resources. Numerous studies have dealt with the connections linking human action with the environmental impact, but this research field remains insufficiently documented. Human resources constitute the center of decision to reduce the ecological footprint, but studies on the impact of human capital and the social and human dimension of globalization on environmental sustainability have been insufficiently analyzed. Therefore, the aim of this study is to verify the capacity of human capital and the social dimension of globalization in addition to its political and economic ones to mitigate environmental degradation. The study referred to the FMOLS, DOLS, and PMG-ARDL methods applied to 13 fossil fuel-rich countries spanning the period 1992–2017 and applied a set of robustness tests based on the cross-section dependence test, unit root tests, and Johansen combined test. The findings, based on FMOLS and DOLS techniques, demonstrate that human capital exerts positive long-term influence upon ecological footprint in the case of fossil fuel-rich countries. Globalization does not significantly impact ecological footprint: only political globalization is able to decrease deterioration in the environment, and neither economic nor social globalizations have an effect. When applying the PMG-ARDL approach, the results supported those derived from FMOLS and DOLS methods and revealed that human capital positively affects ecological footprint in the long term but without significant short-term effects. Our results also showed that globalization is beneficial for high-income countries and harmful for middle-income countries in terms of mitigating environmental degradation. So, the reduction of the ecological footprint in the fossil fuel-rich economies remains dependent on the actions taken by political decision-makers at the international level and on the awareness of human capital of the urgency of mitigating environmental degradation. A set of recommendations in favor of environmental sustainability, in particular those relating to human action and which can serve decision-makers, were formulated in this study. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Radical solutions to decarbonize nitrogen fixation include plasma-electrified ammonia (NH3) synthesis using water and atmospheric nitrogen. Here, we resolve the intrinsic limitations of the state-of-the-art solutions in (i) energy efficiency; (ii) scalability; (iii) direct use of clean renewable energy; and (iv) direct sustainable application of water-based nitrogen fixation by the novel, scalable plasma-enabled process and system for the continuous-flow, scalable nitrogen fixation, and aeroponics using plasma-activated mist (PAM). The new approach is based on the continuous, scalable, in-flow generation of PAM containing NH4+, NO3-, NO2-, and other nitrogen-fixation species through the reaction of large-area uniform air plasma and high-flux water mist containing large area-to-volume ratio micron-sized droplets. Through the solar-energy-driven plasma-assisted oxidation confined within the droplet micro-reactors, a liquid-phase nitrogen fixation product dominated by NO3- is produced. This PAM nitrogen fixation system is applied for the continuous delivery of nitrogen-based nutrients directly to the roots of living plants using a custom-designed aeroponic system which increases the leaf emergence rate and leaf area of bean sprouts by more than 30%. The unique energy concentration in droplet microreactors leads to the much increased (from 2 to 39 times) energy efficiency at a larger scale compared to the key types of common lab-scale plasma reactors. Compatibility with direct solar power, flow-reactor chemistry, and electrified processes at industry-relevant scales make this low-cost, low-carbon-footprint, renewable-energy-driven process and system promising for the widespread sustainable and distributed production and applications of plasma-enabled nitrogen fixation. © 2023 American Chemical Society."

Background: To understand fertility decision making, it is important to identify factors that influence fertility desires. Concerns about environmental problems may be associated with lower desired fertility, especially in recent cohorts transitioning to adulthood. Youth may feel that having one less child can reduce their “carbon footprint” or may be unwilling to bring children into an uncertain and difficult future due to climate change. Method: Data are from 12th graders in the Monitoring the Future study (2005–2019; N = 34,104). Regression is used to examine the relationship between number of children wanted and agreement that the government should deal with environmental problems even if it means paying more taxes. Results: Those who endorsed that government should deal with environmental problems reported lower average fertility desires than those who did not. The association was driven by a decreased desire for large families (four or more children) rather than normatively sized families (2–3 children). Political identity and religiosity attenuated but did not explain the association. There was some evidence of stronger associations in 2017–2019. Conclusion: Evidence showed associations between environmental attitudes and childbearing preferences that may have strengthened over time. Implications: Environmental attitudes may be a factor in the recent decline in youth's fertility desires and could have consequences for future fertility. © 2022 National Council on Family Relations."

However, whether the operation period of solar parks can increase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in hosting natural ecosystems has not been fully considered. Here, we conducted a field experiment to compensate for the lack of evaluation of the effects of PV array deployment on GHG emissions. Our results show that the PV arrays caused significant differences in air microclimate, soil properties, and vegetation characteristics. Simultaneously, PV arrays had more significant effects on CO2 and N2O emissions but a minor impact on CH4 uptake in the growing season. Of all the environmental variables included, soil temperature and moisture were the main drivers of GHG flux variation. The sustained flux global warming potential from the PV arrays significantly increased by 8.14% compared to the ambient grassland. Our evaluation models identified that the GHG footprint of PV arrays during the operation period on grasslands was 20.62 g CO2-eq kW h-1. Compared with our model estimates, GHG footprint estimates reported in previous studies were generally less by 25.46-50.76%. The contribution of PV power generation to GHG reduction may be overestimated without considering the impact of PV arrays on hosting ecosystems. © 2023 American Chemical Society."

Design/methodology/approach: For empirical analysis, the samples for the years 2001–2019 of six GCC region countries that apply the fully modified ordinary least squares model were utilized. Findings: The statistical results show that economic development, foreign investment, energy dependency, human capital and oil rents have a direct impact on CO2 emissions, whereas trade liberalization and FD have an indirect impact. Nonetheless, the empirical analysis rejects the EKC hypothesis in the set of GCC region countries. The empirical findings in connection to the basic premises of the EKC model are found to be statistically constant for the linear relationship. The GCC region is rigid regarding CO2 emission because of its reliance on main energy sources like oil and gas. Research limitations/implications: The current analysis directs the policy recommendations about environmental sustainability to environmental economists and other policymakers. The development of such policy instruments as the adoption of contemporary technology and reduced reliance on fossil fuels is advised to mitigate the negative externalities of multiple economic factors. Similarly, future studies should focus on trade liberalization and FD, both of which have a declining trend in CO2 emissions.

In this research, near real-time RFID data tracing and tracking container cargo are shared by the automated monitoring system. The collected data gathered via digitalization is further analyzed to ensure a greener maritime logistics system. The significant findings of the study for the literature show that the actual fuel consumption is reduced when automated monitoring systems are used at the ports (Ports and CFS (Container freight station)). The reduced fuel consumption during the transit between the ports and CFS has resulted in a reduction in carbon emissions of environmental performance. The results show a 6 % reduction in emissions from port to CFS and 23% from CFS to ports. Thus, effective practices in Green Logistics are considered to be beneficial for carbon emissions. These findings contribute to the understanding and development of effective strategies for logistic operations using technologies to create a green performance.

The composite was fabricated by using polymerization reaction of resorcinol-formaldehyde resin (“pulp”) on the surface of three-dimensional skeleton of loofah sponge (“kernel”) to form porous foam via high temperature carbonization, followed by further vacuum adsorption of paraffin wax (“fruit juice”). With excellent electrical and thermal conductivity, light absorption performance as well as thermal energy storage capacity, the designed phase change composite (PCC) system demonstrated superior performance in temperature management, photo/electrical thermal conversion, multi-driver thermoelectric generation and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding. The graded porous structure of carbon foam allowed for high adsorption capacity (∼91%) of paraffin wax which was leak proof, ensuring high enthalpy of the fabricated PCC. Enhanced thermal/electrical conductivity allowed the as-prepared PCCs to provide multi-source driven thermal management performance and excellent EMI shielding (∼52 dB).

In summary, this study provided a novel route for the preparation of multifunctional PCCs and provided broad application prospects in advanced thermal management, energy conversion EMI shielding for PCMs. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"
1477,Net-Zero Target and Emissions from Land Conversions: A Case Study of Maryland’s Climate Solutions Now Act,Article,Hutton P.C.; Mikhailova E.A.; Lin L.; Hao Z.; Zurqani H.A.; Post C.J.; Schlautman M.A.; Shepherd G.B.,Geographies,3.0,2023,40,59,10.3390/geographies3010003,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85160248107&doi=10.3390%2fgeographies3010003&partnerID=40&md5=8b3569c4bfcd1cbd03edf22c4b8b52de,26737086,Scopus,carbon; change; CO<sub>2</sub>; footprint; goal; greenhouse gas; law; market; neutrality; policy,"Many climate change “solution” plans include net-zero goals, which involve balancing the anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) with their removal. Achieving net-zero goals is particularly problematic for soils because they are often excluded from GHG inventories and reduction plans. For example, Maryland’s Climate Solutions Now Act (Senate Bill 528) put forward the goal of lowering emissions of GHG to 60% under 2006 quantities by 2031 and with a target of net-zero emissions by 2045. To achieve these goals, the state of Maryland (MD) needs to quantify GHG emissions from various sources contributing to the state’s total emissions footprint (EF). Soils are currently excluded from MD’s GHG assessments, which raises a question about how the soil impacts the net-zero goal. This study examines the challenges in meeting net-zero goals using an example of carbon dioxide (CO2) as one of the GHG types (net-zero CO2 emissions). The current study quantified the “realized” social costs of CO2 (SC-CO2) emissions for MD from new land developments in the period from 2001 to 2016 which caused a complete loss of 2.2 × 109 kg of total soil carbon (TSC) resulting in $383.8M (where M = million, USD = US dollars). All MD’s counties experienced land developments with various emissions and SC-CO2 monetary values. Most of the developments, TSC losses, and SC-CO2 occurred near the existing urban areas of Annapolis and Baltimore City. These emissions need to be accounted for in MD’s GHG emissions reduction plans to achieve a net-zero target. Soils of MD are limited in recarbonization capacity because 64% of the state area is occupied by highly leached Ultisols. Soil recarbonization potential is further reduced by urbanization with Prince George’s, Montgomery, and Frederick counties experiencing the highest increases in developed areas. In addition, projected sea-level rises will impact 17 of MD’s 23 counties. These losses will generate additional social costs because of migration, costs of relocation, and damages to infrastructure. The state of MD has a high proportion of private land ownership (92.4%) and low proportion of public lands, which will limit opportunities for relocation within the state. Net-zero targets are important but meeting these targets without specific and integrative approaches depending on the source and type of emissions may result in failure. These approaches should also focus on the social costs of emissions, which raises the need for a new concept of integrating net-zero emissions and social costs. © 2022 by the authors."

Türkiye is the largest producer of rainbow trout in Europe, but there is little data on its CF. This study aimed to evaluate the CF expended of concrete pond rainbow trout (CPRT) farming. The data were obtained from a farm with an annual project production capacity of 350 tonnes (APC) over a three-year production (TYP) with different harvest amounts. The total CF expended was the summation of CF expended on compound diets, general management, transportation and machinery, equipment, and construction. The total CF expended was calculated at 1.78 and 1.67 kg CO2e on average for TYP and APC, respectively. The TYP average values of CF expended per kg of protein deposited in harvested/ fresh weight fish and CF expended per Mcal of cultural energy expended during production were 10.66 and 0.36 kg CO2e, respectively. The CF expended per 100 kcal food energy in harvested fish was calculated at 0.1263 and 0.1173 kg CO2e on average for TYP and APC, respectively. Aquafeed production and transportation are the important CF expended sources in CPRT. Future studies must be species-specific and culture-specific. © 2023 The Author."

It makes sense to improve the hydrophobic property of HBSC to obtain high durability performance. In this paper, nontoxic short carbon chain lauric acid (LA) is used to match the early strength characteristic of HBSC to prepare fast-setting and eco-friendly LA-modified HBSC mortar (M-HBSCM). Sands modified with LA provide low surface energy for an integral hydrophobic effect. M-HBSCM exhibits superhydrophobicity even after hammering to expose the fractured internal structure, with a contact angle of 153.2°. And it shows outstanding self-cleaning property against contaminants such as sand and wet mud and a reduction in water absorption to around 23% of the ordinary HBSCM (O-HBSCM). The fabricated M-HBSCM has fast-setting property with an initial setting time of 29 min and a final setting time of 36 min. The abrasion test displays that the scratched area remains well superhydrophobic with high mechanical robustness when the droplets roll off on the inclined surface. Field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) indicates that M-HBSCM contains more pores and coarser hydration products. The system of calcium alumina and pores exhibits a distinct hierarchical structure, providing the multilevel roughness required for the superhydrophobic surface. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer indicates that low surface energy functional groups have been successfully grafted onto M-HBSCM. The superhydrophobic concrete has good mechanical robustness, corrosion resistance, and fast-setting property, which can meet the demands of grouting reinforcement projects, the repair of various concrete structures, corrosion protection of marine structures and other projects. © 2023 The Authors"

Methane reforming assisted by an oxygen carrier was currently investigated, being an attractive option for production of hydrogen and carbon monoxide mixtures. The distinctive aspect of present research was the development of three different granular materials based on CeO2 to be used in fluidized beds, obtained by pelletization and calcination at 900 and 1200 °C of CeO2 or CeO2/Al2O3 powder. Fluidization and abrasion tests were performed at cold and hot conditions, showing the best attrition resistance of materials calcined at the highest temperature, with attrition rate equal to 0.3 %/h. Conversely, thermogravimetric tests at 900 °C revealed the best performance of CeO2 granules sintered at lower temperature with respect to the others in terms of oxygen supply capacity, achieving 0.55 of conversion degree. Reforming and regeneration cycles were performed in fluidized bed at 940 °C with CeO2/Al2O3 granules, providing instantaneous methane conversion up to 37 %, high carrier conversion (0.87) and low carbon deposition (2.9 mg/g) during the reforming step. © 2023 Institution of Chemical Engineers"

In our study, we consider a supply chain in which a manufacturer invests in green technology to decrease the carbon footprint. The main issue addressed here is how the manufacturer selects the optimal online selling format between agency selling and reselling to ensure profitability with a lower carbon footprint. In an uncertain market with considering different pricing sequences in dual-channel promotion,we explore six scenarios. The results show that the different pricing sequences will not affect the equilibrium green degree and pricing strategies under agency selling, whereas it may result in an improved greenness in reselling format. Furthermore, under the interaction of uncertain demand, pricing sequence and green technology investment, we reveal the agent selling format is not always superior to the reselling format with a double-marginalization effect, which contrary to the general intuition. Specifically, in an optimistic market, the manufacturer is more profitable in reselling format when the promotion price set in online channel prior to traditional channel, and in a pessimistic market, the opposite pricing sequence formulated will bring a considerable benefit to the manufacturer.  © The authors.

Greenhouse gas emissions are likely to decrease with a transition to a circular system; however, a systematic and integrated perspective on plastics and the carbon cycle is currently missing in the debate on plastics. In this study, a model to estimate greenhouse gas emissions of the current mostly linear plastics value chain of the EU in 2018 and a future scenario, 2025 model, were created. By 2025 if current policy targets are reached, the plastic packaging recycling rate should be 50%, PET-based drinking bottles should include 25% recycled content, 77% collection target for plastic bottles, 10 Mt recyclates should enter the markets, uptake of bio-based plastics is estimated by European bioplastics to increase from current 1 to 1.32% and landfilling will continue to decrease according to the current trend at 3.85%. Total greenhouse gas emissions caused by the current plastics value chain are estimated at 208 million tonnes of CO2-eq. The 2025 model estimates that total plastics value chain emissions will be 182 Mt of CO2-eq. Reduction potential is approximately 26 Mt of CO2-eq or 13%. © 2022, The Author(s)."

Although research activities have already given their attention to major industries such as steel, small sectors such as metal casting have been overlooked. Therefore, there are evident knowledge gaps regarding the environmental impact of the foundry industry and the possibilities of decarbonizing the sector. Herein, this study focuses on the CO2 emissions associated with cast iron production and introduces an interdisciplinary framework in order to study the environmental impact, technical performance and production costs. The theoretical and experimental analyses illustrate the interconnections between the environmental, technical and economic aspects of cast iron production. The results emphasize the role of the smelting process and renewable energies in decreasing the carbon footprint. In terms of the input materials, the outcomes demonstrate that increasing the steel scrap content achieves considerable reductions in the CO2 emissions. An alloy composition with a steel scrap content of 25% leads to a minimum carbon footprint of 650 kg CO2 eq./ton. However, increasing the steel scrap content further results in higher carbon footprints due to the additional materials required to maintain the alloy composition. Moreover, a higher strength and lower ductility of the alloy were recorded due to higher amounts of carbide stabilizing elements. The study highlights the importance of adopting a holistic approach in order to define the optimal material combinations. Hence, the presented interdisciplinary approach can be applied by the foundries in order to achieving the technical, economic and ecological goals of the sector. © 2022, The Author(s)."

Although GPP is regularly measured with eddy covariance (EC) systems, these are restricted to the tower footprint area, and remote sensing (RS) products have estimated GPP using multispectral vegetation indexes (VIs) from farms to whole ecosystems. Indeed, nowadays, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based RS technology is becoming more accessible. Accordingly, we propose the estimation of GPP using VIs at high spatial resolutions using UAVs and multi-spectral cameras. A small typical farm in Colombia was cultivated with carrot as our base crop. An EC system was installed to estimate GPP and was used as a reference. A total of 24 VIs from UAV-based RS products were selected and compared with the GPP of the EC system. A cross-validation process was performed, and seven VIs obtained a high R2 score (0.76–0.78). The accumulated GPP, estimated with the best index (NIRv) was 520.3 g C m−2, while the GPP-EC estimate was 580.4 g C m−2 (10.3% error). This work showed that it is possible to estimate the GPP of carrot crops using UAV-based RS, VIs, and linear regression models, which can be used in further research on GPP using UAVs. © 2023 by the authors."

A significant part of this increase comprises the aviation and tourism sectors. In particular, the rapid growth of the aviation industry and its relationship with tourism development constitutes an indispensable problem for the future in the fight against the climate crisis. In this study, it has been revealed that the aviation industry is not innocent at all regarding the climate crisis when combined with tourism. The study examined flights’ average personal carbon footprint to Cappadocia Airport between 2016 and 2019. The Cappadocia region stands out because it is an important tourism region of Turkiye and is located right in the middle of Turkiye. In the review, 2019 was the period with the highest emissions of 27,464.08 tons CO2. On the other hand, 2017 was the year that emitted the least, with 8121,29 tons CO2. The personal carbon footprint from total flights was 61,951 kg CO2. While the individual carbon footprint was the highest in 2016 with 70,617 kg CO2, 2019 was the year with the lowest personal carbon footprint with 56,419 kg CO2. As a result, while there is a direct proportion between the number of flights and the total increase in CO2, the personal carbon footprint has changed according to the number of passengers. Transportation preferences should be reviewed considering the location of the Cappadocia region and Turkiye’s transportation policy. © 2023 Environmental Research and Technology.

To better understand when the benefits of this technology outweigh its environmental costs, a focused exploration of the environmental impact of 3D printing is warranted to quantify carbon emissions attributable to craniofacial surgical constructs. Methods: All invoice data from commercial vendors used at Johns Hopkins Hospital for the 2-year period from January 2020 to December 2021 were reviewed. Information on the material composition of each construct was recorded. Additionally, a total of 19 commercial printers were included. Conversion factors from the U.S. EIA were used to calculate the carbon emissions generated by the fuel consumption of each printer per hour. Results: Invoice data revealed 406 patient-specific constructs (158 contour models, 104 guides, 84 implants, and 60 splints). A total of 2644.4 printer hours and 36.1 MW of power were needed to manufacture all constructs. This is equivalent to releasing 15.71 metric tons of carbon emissions, corresponding to the emissions produced by burning 7882.1 kg of coal or 36.4 barrels of oil. Conclusion: 3D printing is a resource-intensive practice in CMF surgery. Therefore, when weighing patient benefits against environmental detriment, CMF surgeons must determine indications where 3D printing is unessential. Restricting prints to the anatomy of interest, minimizing support structures, and reusing printed constructs may all help to lessen the environmental impact of this growing practice. © The Author(s) 2023."

In addition to the price and time efficiencies that characterize agile and lean supply chains, strategies for low-carbon and energy-efficient external transport must also be incorporated. This research therefore focuses on the challenges of organizing the supply of small overseas shipments to define how the relationship between land and sea transport in the selected intermodal chain affects environmental and energy performance. Understanding the input parameters and their impacts is a prerequisite for planning CO2, NOx, SO2 and NMHC emissions, as well as energy efficiency (EE) of overseas transportation. The number of individual transport legs and their characteristics are crucial parameters for sustainable transport chains. The applicability of the proposed research framework is carried out on the example of outbound supply chains of the southern part of the Baltic-Adriatic Corridor using intermodal transport chains of small shipments via the ports of Koper and Genoa. The results of the case study show that an additional transport leg representing only 2 % longer land transport to the port of Genoa significantly affects the carbon footprint of the whole supply chain's compared to chains via the port of Koper. Moreover, other results also require special attention in supply chain modeling. The study enriches the field of supply chain engineering, as there is a lack of such studies.

Here, we first report galvanic biomining that achieves both efficient resource recovery and power generation based on the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox couple of indirect/noncontact bioleaching. Ore oxidation, oxidant regeneration, and power generation are achieved in the oxidation leaching section, the bio-oxidation section, and the galvanic biomining reactor, respectively. At various temperatures and in the presence of toxic ions, leaching rates are approximately 10 times higher than those of conventional bioleaching, which represents a breakthrough of the above bottleneck. The power generation, bacterial carbon sequestration, and total carbon sequestration are 23.5 kW h, 34.4, and 2510 kg, respectively, per ton of copper produced. The galvanic biomining effectively regenerates oxidants at room temperature and significantly reduces power consumption and the carbon footprint. © 2023 American Chemical Society"

In the U.S., the growing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) will significantly impact the electrical grid and associated greenhouse gas emissions, but with significant differences between the balancing regions due to the diverse characteristics of their electrical grids. This work assesses the impacts associated with the increasing penetration of EVs in the U.S., considering the characteristics of the grid in the different regions, in order to discuss the needed strategies to maximize the future decarbonization benefits. The assessment considers the variation in generation mix profiles during the day in each region, as well as different charging profiles associated with home, work, and public charging. The results show that more ambitious policies for the increasing share of carbon-free generation in the regions with the highest emissions are needed, emphasizing incentives for the use of work and public charging, and ensuring effective management of the charging flexibility. © 2023 by the authors."

Monitoring of fluid concentration specifically becomes challenging during a sequestration/enhanced oil recovery program because the objective is to understand the amount of initial fluid replaced by liquid/gas injection and identify the probability of leakage with time. The prior assumption of uniform or patchy type of distribution of gas in a rock-physics theory leads to large uncertainty in the prediction of saturation. As a result, we have used the capillary pressure equilibrium theory (CPET) for creating a reservoir model that matches the physics of capillary-induced fluid invasion and avoids the uncertainty related to the type of distribution of gas in pores. We create a CPET model using the reservoir parameters of the clean and unconsolidated sandstone formation of the Sleipner field, North Sea, which is the world's first industrial-scale CO2-injection project, assuming that there is no significant change in the rock frame throughout the field. The model is then used to analyze the fluid content from the time-lapse seismic inversion results of the Sleipner field. CO2 at higher quantities, according to our research, is analogous to a uniform distribution, whereas CO2 at lower concentrations is mostly in between patchy and uniform distribution or slightly patchy type. We predict maximum CO2 saturation from a quantitative interpretation of six time-lapse seismic data from 1999 to 2010 using the CPET as 75% of the pore space, and the footprint of the CO2 plume in the topmost layer is spreading from zero in 2001 to 7 × 105 m2 in 2010. Our model finds that injected CO2 from all layers below will migrate to the top layer approximately 50 years after the commencement of the injection.  © 2023 Society of Exploration Geophysicists."

With shortening inpatient periods, the post-discharge element of surveillance is becoming increasingly important. Proactive surveillance, including digital wound images using patient smartphones, may be an efficient alternative to traditional methods for collecting post-discharge surveillance (PDS). Aim: To determine success in patient enrolment and engagement including reasons for non-response, the time for clinicians to respond to patients, SSI rates, and carbon emissions when conducting PDS using patient smartphones. Methods: An evaluation was undertaken for a one-month period (June 2022) in two adult cardiac surgery services which routinely used patient smartphones for PDS, using the secure Islacare (Isla) system. Findings: The initial patient response rate for Isla was 87.3%, and the majority of patients (73%) remained engaged throughout the 30-day period. There was no significant difference in age, gender, operation type or distance to hospital between Isla responders or non-responders, or if the hospital provided a photo at discharge or not. Patients using Isla had a shorter post-discharge stay (P = 0.03), although this was not attributed to the platform. Patients not owning a smartphone and a technical issue were the main barriers to participation. Overall, nine SSIs were recorded, eight through the Isla surveillance and one through a hospital transfer readmission. The carbon emission associated with the SSI ranged from 5 to 2615 kg CO2e. Conclusion: In a real-world setting, using patient smartphones is an effective method to collect PDS, including wound images. © 2023 The Author(s)"

A larger stock 3D printer was found to provide a melting capacity of 14.4 ml/h, while a smaller printer with an upgraded extruder had a melting capacity of 36 ml/h. 3D printing at these maximum melting capacities resulted in specific energy consumption (SEC) of 16.5 and 5.28 kWh/kg, respectively, with the latter value being less than 50% of the lowest values reported in the literature. Even so, analysis of these respective processes found them to be only 2.9% and 3.8% efficient relative to their theoretical minimum energy requirements. By comparison, cold and hot runner molding with an all-electric machine had SEC of 1.28 and 0.929 kWh/kg, respectively, with efficiencies of 9.9% and 13.6% relative to the theoretical minima. Breakeven analysis considering the cost and carbon footprint of mold tooling found injection molding was preferable at a production quantity of around 70,000 units. Parametric analysis of model inputs indicates that the breakeven quantities are robust with respect to carbon tax incentives but highly dependent on mold costs, labor costs, and part size. Dimensional and mechanical properties of the molded and 3D printed specimens are also characterized and discussed. © 2023 The Authors.

This study first identified possible sites of small hydropower plants with estimated capacity, and then utilized resources time footprint as a novel way to evaluate the impact of small hydropower plants on the aspects of materials, CO2, labor, and land. Resources time footprint is a sustainability indicator that uses a uniform time unit (years). It assesses whether the usage of resources exceeds the amount allocated to different people and generations. The smaller the value of resources time footprint, the more environmentally friendly is the process. Preferential locations for small hydropower in Dan River were specified, with a potential capacity ranging from 273 to 1175 kW. Resources time footprint of copper is 8.9–47.3 times as large as that of steel. Resources time footprint of CO2 emissions is much smaller than that of other aspects, revealing that small hydropower has a great potential to mitigate the greenhouse effect. The overall resources time footprint decreases with an increase in the installed capacity. The methodology proposed in this study can be used to identify the ideal locations for setting up small hydropower plants in other regions as well. © 2023 The Authors"

This study expands the horizon of this debate by introducing new potential determinants of environmental performance. In doing so, the authors study the impacts of financial inclusion, green innovation, and energy efficiency on ecological issues. The prime objective of this study is to report some novel findings and implications regarding structural change of economy, green innovation and industry related factors in context of sustainable development. The authors use the annual data of variables from 2000 to 2018, and employ the novel quantile regression method. Notable, the results mention that industrial growth and financial inclusion positively induce ecological footprints. The results show that impact of financial inclusion increases with higher quantiles, implying that financial inclusion induces higher ecological footprint in countries with already higher ecological footprint levels than those with lower ecological footprint levels. The study suggest that policymakers must introduce proper policies to improve the financial system, which has important implications for renewable and clean energies. The developed economies should focus heavily on increasing green patents to the point where the positive results of such technologies in the form of less or carbon-neutral processes begin to pour in. It is also critical to transition industrial economies to carbon-free technologies, as industrial output is a key contributor to the growing ecological footprint. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."

The environmental impact of global health partnerships has not previously been quantified. Methods: We conducted a retrospective internal audit of the environmental impact of air travel for the international education programs of the Canadian Anesthesiology Society’s International Education Fund (CASIEF). We compiled a comprehensive list of volunteer travel routes and used the International Civil Aviation Organization Carbon Emissions Calculator, which considers travel distance, passenger numbers, and average operational data for optimized estimates. Comparisons were made with average Canadian household emissions and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) lost from climate change consequences. Results: The total carbon dioxide emitted (CO2-e) for the Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Guyana CASIEF partnerships were 268.2, 60.7, and 52.0 tons, respectively. The DALYs cost of these programs combined is estimated to be as high as 1.1 years of life lost due to the effects of CO2-e. The mean daily carbon cost of the average Rwanda partnership was equivalent to daily emissions of 2.2 Canadians (or 383 Rwandans), for the Guyana partnership was equivalent to 1.6 Canadians (or 7.6 Guyanese people), and for the Ethiopia partnership was equivalent to 2.4 Canadians (or 252 Ethiopian people). Conclusions: Air travel from these CASIEF partnerships resulted in 380.9 tons CO2-e but also enabled 5,601 volunteer days-in-country since 2014. The estimated environmental cost needs to be balanced against the impact of the programs. Regardless, carbon-reduction remains a priority, whether by discouraging premium class travel, organizing longer trips to reduce daily emissions, prioritizing remote support and virtual education, or developing partnerships closer to home. © 2023, Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society."

This study was conducted in part of the Western Ghats comprising three different ecosystems, viz., agro ecosystem (AE), tea ecosystem (TE), and forest ecosystem (FE) to assess the impact of LUC on soil carbon dynamics. A total of 150 sites were chosen and soil samples were collected at three depth classes of 0–15, 15–30, and 30–45 cm to quantify the carbon pools, total organic carbon (TOC), total inorganic carbon (TIC), total carbon (TC), carbon stock, and carbon management index (CMI). The findings revealed that TOC concentration and carbon stock were significantly higher in FE than in TE and AE. On average (0–45 cm), the carbon stocks recorded in FE, TE, and AE were 77.94, 44.32, and 32.30 t ha−1 and decreased with the depth, while the concentration of total inorganic carbon (TIC) increased with depth. Among the various carbon pools, the very labile carbon (VLC) was higher in AE and TE while the non-labile carbon (NLC) was higher in FE. The active carbon pools (AP) in AE and TE were higher than passive carbon pools (PP), whereas the reverse trend occurred in FE. The results depict the shift in carbon dynamics under different ecosystems of Ooty. The magnitude of the shift is measured by the carbon management index (CMI), which revealed a higher CMI in FE than in AE and TE. The findings thus suggest the imperative need for immediate implementation of carbon management strategies in AE and TE to improve the carbon sequestration potential, achieve land degradation neutrality and improve the carbon footprints of the Ooty. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Sociedad Chilena de la Ciencia del Suelo."

The study aimed to evaluate the water, energy, and carbon nexus (WECN) in the combined cycle power plants. First, carbon and water footprints were estimated by the LCA method. Then, the WEN and flow relations were investigated using the REWSS (Regional Energy & Water Supply Scenarios model) model and the Sankey diagram. Finally, optimal relationships between WEN were defined using Vensim software to increase electricity production along with managing water consumption and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The result of WECN in this study showed that the average annual amount of water footprint in electricity generated was 980 L of water consumed per MWh of electricity. The highest and lowest water footprint was related to the Damavand (67.14 L/MWh) and Zavareh (18.95 L/MWh) power plants, respectively. Moreover, the average annual amount of carbon footprint in electricity generated was 0.623 t/mkWh of electricity. The highest and lowest average carbon footprint was related to Fars (1.15 t/mkWh) and Khoy (0.53 t/mkWh) power plants, respectively. Further, the highest (1898 kcal/kWh) and lowest (1704 kcal/kWh) thermal efficiency was determined for Khoy and Gilan power plants, respectively. The comparison of WEN results showed that the amount of electricity generation, water consumption, and carbon emissions in combined cycle power plants are not always directly related to each other.

As the technology matures, more data are becoming available and uncertainties decline. The goal of this ex-ante life cycle assessment (LCA) was to provide an outlook of the environmental performance of commercial-scale CM production in 2030 and to compare this to conventional animal production in 2030, using recent and often primary data, combined with scenario analysis. Methods: This comparative attributional ex-ante LCA used the ReCiPe Midpoint impact assessment method. System boundaries were cradle-to-gate, and the functional unit was 1 kg of meat. Data were collected from over 15 companies active in CM production and its supply chain. Source data include lab-scale primary data from five CM producers, full-scale primary data from processes in comparable manufacturing fields, data from computational models, and data from published literature. Important data have been cross-checked with additional experts. Scenarios were used to represent the variation in data and to assess the influence of important choices such as energy mix. Ambitious benchmarks were made for conventional beef, pork, and chicken production systems, which include efficient intensive European animal agriculture and incorporate potential improvements for 2030. Results and discussion: CM is almost three times more efficient in turning crops into meat than chicken, the most efficient animal, and therefore agricultural land use is low. Nitrogen-related and air pollution emissions of CM are also lower because of this efficiency and because CM is produced in a contained system without manure. CM production is energy-intensive, and therefore the energy mix used for production and in its supply chain is important. Using renewable energy, the carbon footprint is lower than beef and pork and comparable to the ambitious benchmark of chicken. Greenhouse gas profiles are different, being mostly CO2 for CM and more CH4 and N2O for conventional meats. Climate hotspots are energy used for maintaining temperature in reactors and for biotechnological production of culture medium ingredients. Conclusions: CM has the potential to have a lower environmental impact than ambitious conventional meat benchmarks, for most environmental indicators, most clearly agricultural land use, air pollution, and nitrogen-related emissions. The carbon footprint is substantially lower than that of beef. How it compares to chicken and pork depends on energy mixes. While CM production and its upstream supply chain are energy-intensive, using renewable energy can ensure that it is a sustainable alternative to all conventional meats. Recommendations: CM producers should optimize energy efficiency and source additional renewable energy, leverage supply chain collaborations to ensure sustainable feedstocks, and search for the environmental optimum of culture medium through combining low-impact ingredients and high-performance medium formulation. Governments should consider this emerging industry’s increased renewable energy demand and the sustainability potential of freed-up agricultural land. Consumers should consider CM not as an extra option on the menu, but as a substitute to higher-impact products. © 2023, The Author(s)."

Consequently, there is a concerted effort to decrease the carbon footprint associated with this process, by minimizing the use of OPC. In line with this trend, an attempt was made in the reported study to synthesize a novel alkali-activated binder using CaCO3-rich waste limestone powder (WLSP) as a precursor. Utilizing the Taguchi method, four important parameters were varied at three levels to optimize the alkali-activated mixture. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the obtained results was performed to assess the impact of each of the factors on the properties of the developed binder. To enhance the strength further, OPC was added as a partial replacement of WLSP. The binder was characterized using scanning electron microscopy. The results have indicated that alkaline activator to binder ratio, Na2SiO3 to NaOH ratio, and sand to binder ratio of 0.575, 1.57, and 2.5, respectively, were the optimum to obtain satisfactory strength and workability with a 13.7-M NaOH activator solution. The incorporation of a small quantity of OPC in the mixture remarkably improved the density and strength of the alkali-activated-WLSP binder. Pirssonite (CaCO3.Na2CO3.2H2O) and C/N-A-S-H were the dominant mineral phases formed in the developed binder, particularly in the ones alkali-activated WLSP/OPC. In addition, the eco-efficiency assessment revealed that the WLSP is a promising low-carbon binder that can be used in developing more sustainable alkali-activated binder. The results have shown that the WLSP can be potentially utilized in developing binder that can be potentially used in the structural applications. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Consumption was assumed to contribute 50% of the calculated 48th baseline year. This led to uncertainties as consumer behavior changes from birth to adulthood. Furthermore, transport emissions and environmental impacts before birth were neglected. Therefore, this paper analyzes the prenatal and infancy phase (0–3 years) to develop the Life-LCA method and database further and evaluate generic assumptions. Methods: The Life-LCA method sets the reporting unit to newly defined prenatal and infancy phases. The reporting flow describes the range of all consumed products attributable to an infant. Primary data was collected with a sample of three study objects—a pregnant mother, a newborn baby, and a 3-year-old infant—living in Germany. The following environmental impact assessment categories are considered: climate change (GWP), acidification (AP), eutrophication (EP), and photochemical ozone creation (POCP). Results and discussion: Prenatal and infancy phase burdens account for a GWP of 4,011 kg CO2-eq., an AP of 22.3 kg SO2-eq., an EP of 10.7 kg PO4-eq., and a POCP of 1.7 kg C2H4-eq. The share of the prenatal phase is around 15–20% for all impact categories. Transport is a hotspot for GWP (30–60%) and POCP (45–70%) in both phases. AP (50%) and EP (45–50%) are dominated by food products, mainly meat (45%) and dairy products (35%). For the prenatal phase, energy and water consumption at birth rank third in GWP (8%). Diapers account for 6% (GWP) of the environmental burden in the infancy phase. Assumptions made in the first Life-LCA study connect closely with the values calculated for the first three years of infancy. A remaining challenge is allocating the impacts between infants and parents and developing a methodology for assessing data quality. Conclusion: Focusing on two new life phases has led to the subdivision of the “childhood and youth stage” and an extension of the system boundaries. The results' uncertainty was reduced by developing a new set of specific datasets focusing on several study objects. The case study results show the importance of primary data collection for evaluating generic assumptions. Additional studies on childhood and adolescence from 3 to 17 years are suggested for a robust assessment of the complete “childhood and youth stage.” © 2023, The Author(s)."

We performed the first life cycle assessment of the external compound parabolic concentrator (XCPC) solar array, a novel low-concentration and non-tracking solar thermal technology capable of providing low-to medium-temperature heat (up to 250 °C). Primary data on the materials and performance of the XCPC were used in this analysis. The embodied greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with manufacturing the technology are 92.4 kg CO2eq/m2, cradle-to-gate. The life cycle GHG emissions cradle-to-grave over a 25-year lifetime under conditions in the Central Valley of California are 129.7 kg CO2eq/m2. On the basis of thermal energy delivered, the XCPC has a carbon footprint of 5.8 g CO2eq per kWhth. These results indicate that the XCPC can generate low temperature heat with a carbon footprint 97% lower than natural gas and 98% lower than propane combustion in regions of high solar insolation. © 2023 The Authors"

Massive sensing devices access to 5G base station to transmit collected carbon emission data, which requires intelligent access management. Fast uplink grant possesses the advantages of reducing signalling overhead and access conflicts while facing the problems of incomplete information and difficulty in guaranteeing priority constraint. This paper examines, the maximum access queuing delay minimization problem is formulated under the long-term service priority constraint and the short-term access management constraint. First, Lyapunov optimization is leveraged to decouple the long-term service priority constraint and short-term access management optimization, and decompose the long-term stochastic optimization problem into a series of short-term deterministic problems. Then, a priority-aware deep Q-network (DQN)-based fast uplink grant access management (PDAC) algorithm is proposed to achieve intelligent access management with differentiated service priority requirements. PDAC utilizes DQN to handle non-convex high-dimensional optimization problem with service priority constraint to achieve intelligent access management and priority awareness. Simulation results demonstrate that PDAC outperforms the existing algorithms in access queuing delay, buffer queue backlog, and priority deficit fluctuation. © 2022 The Authors.

Consequently, the environmental impacts associated with ICT are increasing, and innovative solutions must be deployed to reduce these impacts and increase students’ awareness. Single-board computers (SBCs) are promising because they rely on less materials and energy than desktop computers (PCs). But additional servers are required to perform large-scale computations. Hence, this paper aims at conducting comparative LCA between SBCs and PCs. Materials and methods: The study is conducted in the context of a French engineering school with the following functional unit: “use 600 computers for 5 years in an engineering school.” Two scenarios are defined to fulfil this functional unit. Scenario 1 is the use of 600 PCs (current infrastructure), and scenario 2 is the use of 600 SBCs combined with 6 servers (alternative infrastructure). The analysis includes the materials manufacturing, assembly, packaging, transport, use and end-of-life of each device. Life cycle inventory (LCI) of the foreground systems was generated using a variety of sources: disassembly of computers, counting of electronic components, datasheets, estimations, etc. LCI of the background systems is taken from ecoinvent 3.5. The selected life cycle impact assessment methodology is ReCiPe 2016 midpoint, and computation of impacts is done with openLCA 1.10.3. Results and discussion: Scenario 2 (SBCs + servers) generates 84 to 92% less impact than scenario 1 (PCs) in all categories. In terms of global warming, scenarios 1 and 2 generate 225 and 18 tCO2 eq per functional unit, respectively. This is explained by the large reduction in material and energy requirements for SBCs which is not counterbalanced by the servers. Equipment manufacturing accounts for the largest share of impacts in most categories for both scenarios (e.g., ~70% for global warming), followed by the use phase. This differs from the results found in the literature, as this study was conducted in the context of France, which has a low-carbon electricity mix. Conclusions: Our analysis has shown that SBCs combined with servers reduce the carbon footprint and other environmental impacts of ICT infrastructure for higher education. This study provides an example of low tech-oriented solution for students. Other prospective solutions (e.g., use of laptops) should be extensively studied in the future. From an LCA point of view, updating the inventory data related to background processes for electronic components is a necessary step forward to improve the certainty of the results. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Trainee-led Research and Audit in Anaesthesia for Sustainable Healthcare (TRA2SH) is an Australasian network focused on sustainable anaesthesia practice. TRA2SH hypothesised that trainee-led audits alongside education presented on a scheduled national day, called Operation Clean Up, can improve engagement with sustainability initiatives. This paper aims to describe the first two years of Operation Clean Up in terms of goals, achievements and data collected so far. Environmental themes for Operation Clean Up were chosen based on available evidence (life cycle analyses and observational studies). The first Operation Clean Up (OCU 2020) focused on reducing the unnecessary use of single-use disposable absorbent pads (known as ‘blueys’ in Australia, ‘greenies’ in New Zealand). OCU 2021 included: refuse desflurane, reduce bluey use, reuse drug trays, and recycle paper and cardboard. TRA2SH provided an information pack to trainees who presented educational material to their department and fed back procurement figures to quantify each item. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse de-identified pooled data submitted to a centralised database. Eight departments submitted data for OCU 2020 and six provided follow-up data. Bluey use was reduced from a median of 37 to 34 blueys per ten surgical encounters. Fifteen departments submitted pre-campaign data for OCU 2021 with follow-up data to be collected during OCU 2022. Baseline data showed a median bluey use of 31 per ten surgical encounters. Volatile-related emissions were calculated; desflurane’s proportion was 70% of these emissions yet was 11% of volatile procurement. Two participating departments removed desflurane from their formulary following OCU 2021.

Barley, the fourth most important cereal crop, has been restricted to areas with limited resources. Maintaining a balance between productivity, profitability, and sustainability by identifying viable genotypes that adapt well to resource-restricted settings and assessing them under low energy-carbon intensive management is critical. A field experiment was conducted during 2016-17 to 2018-19 to assess the energy-carbon footprint, productivity and profitability of five barley cultivars under two contrasting tillage-residue management systems in semi-arid plains of North-West India. The zero-till + residue retention (ZT+RR) system, among the tillage-residue management options, and RD-2552 followed by BH-946, among the cultivars, provided significantly higher crop productivity and profitability. Although cultivars' responses to the tillage-residue management method were not statistically significant in terms of grain yield, they were in terms of net returns. Therefore, RD-2552 and BH-946 cultivars could provide higher profitability with the ZT+RR system as compared to those with the conventional-till + residue incorporation (CT+RI) system. Although cultivars did not affect the energy-carbon footprints of barley production, tillage-residue management methods did. The ZT+RR system enhanced the energy and carbon use efficiencies of the barley cultivation with lower energy-carbon footprints. The cultivar RD-2552 followed by BH-946 under the ZT+RR system could provide higher productivity and profitability with lower energy-carbon footprints. Adoption of conservation agriculture-based tillage-residue management practices could improve productivity and profitability of barley crop with reduced energy-carbon footprints in the semi-arid ecologies of India.

To do so, a new two-layer coordinated optimization framework ADN has been proposed considering SOP. In the upper layer, the location and sizing of the DERs and SOPs has been optimised. While inner layer executes simultaneous optimal functioning of volt/var control (VVC) devices, remote controlled switches (RCS), DERs, and SOPs. The main objective of proposed methodology is to reduce total investment cost of DERs and SOPs as well as operating costs of the system over the planning horizon. Besides, objective function considers the cost of energy not served (ENS), the cost of substation-purchased electricity, and the cost of carbon emissions. Meanwhile, a stochastic module has been employed to address high-level uncertainties associated to renewables and load demands. Besides, the effects of distribution network reconfiguration (DNR) and conservation voltage reduction (CVR) have been taken into account. For various instances, the suggested framework was implemented on an IEEE 119-bus distribution system and solved using a proposed hybrid optimization solver. The efficacy of proposed DER with SOP methodology has been validated on various cases and also tested on sudden external disturbances such as under voltage and over voltage problem conditions. When compared to standard planning schemes, the test results show that it is beneficial in boosting system efficiency, increasing reliability, and lowering the carbon footprint of distribution systems. © 2022 IEEE."

Given that ICT devices are ubiquitous, any attempt to mitigate climate change should address the carbon footprint of the ICT sector. The present study examines the direct impact of ICT on the environment and the indirect impact through interaction with energy consumption, financial development, and globalization in SAARC economies from 2000 to 2020. Using econometric approaches robust to cross-sectional dependence, such as the Driscoll-Kraay estimator and the Dumitrescu-Hurlin causality test, the study found that ICT, renewable energy consumption, and globalization significantly reduce CO2 emission, whereas non-renewable energy consumption and financial development significantly increase emission. However, the interaction between financial development and ICT jointly reduces CO2 emissions. Similarly, renewable energy and globalization reduce emissions from increased ICT usage. The study also confirms the validity of the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis for ICT diffusion. The causality test indicates bidirectional causality between ICT and CO2 emissions. Results suggest that SAARC economies can safely boost ICT and related applications to minimize emissions. They should also use renewable energy and green innovations in telecommunications to reduce their adverse environmental repercussions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

On a global perspective, there is a fundamental need to reduce perioperative morbidity and mortality and to provide safe anesthesia. Thus, inhalational anesthetics will remain a significant source of emissions in the foreseeable future. It is, therefore, necessary to develop and implement strategies to minimize the consumption of inhalational anesthetics to reduce the ecological footprint of inhalational anesthesia. Source: We have integrated recent findings concerning climate change, characteristics of established inhalational anesthetics, complex simulative calculations, and clinical expertise to propose a practical and safe strategy to practice ecologically responsible anesthesia using inhalational anesthetics. Principal findings: Comparing the global warming potential of inhalational anesthetics, desflurane is about 20 times more potent than sevoflurane and five times more potent than isoflurane. Balanced anesthesia using low or minimal fresh gas flow (≤ 1 L·min-1) during the wash-in period and metabolic fresh gas flow (0.35 L·min-1) during steady-state maintenance reduces CO2 emissions and costs by approximately 50%. Total intravenous anesthesia and locoregional anesthesia represent further options for lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Conclusion: Responsible anesthetic management choices should prioritize patient safety and consider all available options. If inhalational anesthesia is chosen, the use of minimal or metabolic fresh gas flow reduces the consumption of inhalational anesthetics significantly. Nitrous oxide should be avoided entirely as it contributes to depletion of the ozone layer, and desflurane should only be used in justified exceptional cases. © 2023, The Author(s)."

This study applied the Environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) premises under the extended “STIRPAT model” to add population and GDP (per capita) and information technologies (ICTs) by employing ecological footprint. To estimate, the estimators of this study used the CS-ARDL estimates, and for robustness check, this study used the augmented mean group (AMG) test. The co-integration test found the long-run association between ecological footprint and its main determinants. The results of CS-ARDL have confirmed the imperative role of information technologies in mitigating the ecological footprint in the higher, upper-middle, and lower-middle-income economies of Asian economies. The statistical findings of this study are robust to diagnostic tests and alternative estimation proxies and techniques. Moreover, policymakers need to identify the direction of the information technology–ecological footprint nexus through cooperation in combating climate change with financial assistance in the ICT sector. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Low-cost energy conservation measures play a critical role in power saving on the usage of electronic devices. The paper compares two different facilities using air-conditioning applications to study the impacts of low-cost energy conservation measures (LCECM) in real-time operations. The effect was recorded at both facilities by lowering the air-conditioning running time and increasing its set temperature ensuring that there was no compromise in occupants’ comfort level. As per international performance measurement and verification (IPMV) protocol A, data analysis was done using pre-and post-experiment readings. IPMVP output was analyzed more by running a t-Test in the SPSS software. Results indicated energy conservation with a cumulative impact on carbon footprint, environment, and cost of importing fossil fuel. The limitations of this study are that the energy conservation measurements were made with limited facilities and respondents' restrictions. © 2023, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Based on China’s macro-panel food consumption data, this paper measures the urban–rural and provincial differences in the HFW CF from scale, structure, and temporal-spatial evolution perspectives. The results indicate that HFW and CF continue to grow, and the total CF and per capita HFW in urban households are higher than in rural households. The structural differences between urban and rural HFW CF vary significantly over time and spaces, which reflected that rural households in the southeastern coastal areas have higher per capita HFW CF than urban in 2019. The research results help to clarify the distribution and evolution pattern of HFW CF in China and offer new ideas for the differentiated governance of CF reduction in the food system. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

In this paper, a novel optimization model of PSS configuration is proposed based on low-carbon design. A new method for calculating the carbon footprint of the product modules and service modules in PSS is proposed. A new greenhouse gas (GHG)-PSS structure tree (G-PS3T) is established based on a bill of materials and a PSS structure tree (PS3T) to express the carbon footprint of a PSS. A novel optimization model for PSS configuration with customer satisfaction, profit, and carbon footprint as the optimization objectives is proposed, and a solver method based on the non-dominated sorted genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is established to obtain the optimal configuration solutions for PSS modules. An automated guided vehicle (AGV)-PSS (AGV-PSS) configuration of enterprise A suggests that the proposed PSS configuration optimization model can significantly reduce the average carbon emissions by 32.33 %. The configuration model and optimization method proposed in this paper are effective to obtain low-carbon PSS schemes that satisfy the value proposition of multi-stakeholders in the early design stage. © 2023 Institution of Chemical Engineers"
1523,Knowledge domain and emerging trends of carbon footprint in the field of climate change and energy use: a bibliometric analysis,Article,Cao Y.; Qi F.; Cui H.; Yuan M.,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,30.0,2023,35853,35870,10.1007/s11356-022-24756-1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144285943&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-022-24756-1&partnerID=40&md5=02db8361b30868d87f96148efe3f0727,09441344,Scopus,Carbon footprint; CiteSpace; Climate change; Energy use,"Carbon footprint (CF) research has attained tremendous popularity for improving the climate environment purposes. In particular, current energy use has been identified as the main cause of climate change. CF plays an irreplaceable role in managing energy use, reducing gas emissions, and improving climate change. The objective of this study was to review studies that have developed CF and to perform a bibliometric analysis using two key terms: “climate change” and “energy use”. From bibliometric analysis using CiteSpace and VOSviewer, it was possible to establish a knowledge map of cooperative network structure and research evolution. We are aiming to reveal the main logical chain of CF research leading to climate change, to make up for the lack of current literature, and provide research inspiration for researchers. The research findings mainly focus on four aspects. First, the relevant research began in 2008 and is in a state of continuous rise. Second, due to the law of research development and the prominence of practical problems, related research has experienced a stage from conceptual methods to specific problems. Third, China and the USA assume an important role in which international cooperation is the overall trend. Fourth, related research can be divided into CF algorithm research, ecological environment management research, and specific cross-industry fields. In addition, possible opportunities for change in related research are explored. It is also suggested that the integration of CF with other footprints, when energy use and environmental change are fully considered, may become an important future research trend by providing a more comprehensive environmental impact. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

The analyses were conducted on annual observations from 1970 to 2017 (a different range for each country) employing the Fourier bootstrap ARDL cointegration method developed by Yilanci et al. (2020) and the Fourier bootstrap Toda–Yamamoto causality method developed by Nazlioglu et al. (2016). In the cointegration approach, an additional F-test provides better insights to define degenerate cases and the bootstrap test performance is powerful than the asymptotic test. In this context, Fourier bootstrap ARDL test results revealed that there is a long-term relationship between ecological footprint and economic growth, energy consumption, and economic globalization in seven countries—namely, Canada, China, Germany, India, Indonesia, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. According to long-run coefficients, in general, economic growth and energy consumption have negative effects on ecological footprint, whereas economic globalization has a positive effect on the ecological footprint for these countries. To evaluate it more specifically, (i) real gross domestic product per capita has positive and statistically significant coefficients on the ecological footprint in China, India, Indonesia, Iran, and Saudi Arabia, except for Germany. (ii) Energy consumption per capita also has positive and statistically significant coefficients on the ecological footprint in China, Germany, Iran, and Saudi Arabia, except for Indonesia. (iii) Finally, the economic globalization process has negative and statistically significant coefficients on the ecological footprint in Canada, China, India, and Saudi Arabia, except for Indonesia. On the other hand, Fourier bootstrap Toda–Yamamoto causality test results show a mixed character. Governments should take action to reduce the negative effects of the climate crisis as immediate as possible, which has been widely expressed recently. Among these, increasing the use of renewable energy sources and new carbon-free technologies in the production process appears as important policy tools. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
1525,Carbon fluxes and soil carbon dynamics along a gradient of biogeomorphic succession in alpine wetlands of Tibetan Plateau,Article,Wang H.; Yu L.; Chen L.; Zhang Z.; Li X.; Liang N.; Peng C.; He J.-S.,Fundamental Research,3.0,2023,151,159,10.1016/j.fmre.2022.09.024,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140990130&doi=10.1016%2fj.fmre.2022.09.024&partnerID=40&md5=9aa05971be7d98227ce8e6963c544167,20969457,Scopus,Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Hydrological change; Methane; Soil organic carbon,"Hydrological changes under climate warming drive the biogeomorphic succession of wetlands and may trigger substantial carbon loss from the carbon-rich ecosystems. Although many studies have explored the responses of wetland carbon emissions to short-term hydrological change, it remains poorly understood how the carbon cycle evolves with hydrology-driven wetland succession. Here, we used a space-for-time approach across hydrological gradients on the Tibetan Plateau to examine the dynamics of ecosystem carbon fluxes (carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4)) and soil organic carbon pools during alpine wetland succession. We found that the succession from mesic meadow to fen changed the seasonality of both CO2 and CH4 fluxes, which was related to the shift in plant community composition, enhanced regulation of soil hydrology and increasing contribution of spring-thaw emission. The paludification caused a switch from net uptake of gaseous carbon to net release on an annual timescale but produced a large accumulation of soil organic carbon. We attempted to attribute the paradox between evidence from the carbon fluxes and pools to the lateral carbon input and the systematic changes of historical climate, given that the wetlands are spatially low-lying with strong temporal climate-carbon cycle interactions. These findings demonstrate a systematic change in the carbon cycle with succession and suggest that biogeomorphic succession and lateral carbon flows are both important for understanding the long-term dynamics of wetland carbon footprints. © 2022"

This study aims to estimate the ecological footprint, using such indicators as economic growth, natural resources, human capital, and the number of tourists in top tourism destination countries. For this purpose, artificial neural network models and multivariate regression were used for a period of 24 years (1995–2019). The results of the study showed a significant positive correlation between economic growth and ecological footprint. Multivariate regression estimation (R = 0.75) is weaker than neural network models (R = 96.3). Regarding predicting the ecological footprint, neural network models have better performance in comparison with the multivariate regression statistical methods. Accordingly, one can say that for planning ecological footprint, deeper look at neural networks can be more effective in predicting top tourism destination countries. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

The present study aims to evaluate the energy efficiency and emissions efficiency of 18 Asian countries using the undesirable slack-based data envelopment model and a total factor framework for the period 2001–2020. It has been observed that none of the countries had significantly improved energy efficiency. The total factor energy efficiency (TFEE) index shows that Asian countries have varying levels of energy efficiency, with some countries having high potential for improvement and others already performing well. Kazakhstan and Iran have the most room for improvement, while China and the UAE have seen fluctuations in their TFEE scores. The category with the highest number of countries includes Singapore, Hong Kong, Pakistan, India, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Israel, the Philip-pines, Bangladesh, and Indonesia, with some experiencing significant drops in TFEE scores over the years. Similar patterns can be seen in the total factor carbon emissions efficiency (TFCEE) Index, suggesting that no country is entirely efficient in reducing carbon emissions. Kazakhstan maintains its position at the bottom of the ranking for lowering carbon emissions, while Bangladesh has shown more success. Overall, there is a need for continued efforts to improve energy efficiency in these nations to reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to global sustainability goals. © The Author(s) 2023."

At the same time, the stiff competitive environment in this sector demands every hotel for an enhanced economic performance (ECP). Previously, corporate social responsibility (CSR) was mainly related to an enterprise's environmental performance (ENP) and ECP. However, the role of personal values like altruistic values (AV) and employees' pro-environmental behavior (PEB) remained under-studied in the past literature. This study examines the impact of CSR in spurring ENP and the ECP of hotel enterprises through AV and PEB. In this vein, 410 surveys were collected from hotel employees, and the hypotheses were tested through structural equation modeling. Among different implications, the most important was to realize the greater potential of CSR, which improves ENP and ECP by promoting the PEB and AV of the employees. © 2022 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Networked collections of warehouse scale computers, sometimes called Hyperscale Computing, emit more carbon than needed if operated without regard to these variations in carbon intensity. This paper introduces Google's system for global Carbon-Intelligent Compute Management, which actively minimizes electricity-based carbon footprint and power infrastructure costs by delaying temporally flexible workloads. The core component of the system is a suite of analytical pipelines used to gather the next day's carbon intensity forecasts, train day-ahead demand prediction models, and use risk-aware optimization to generate the next day's carbon-aware Virtual Capacity Curves (VCCs) for all datacenter clusters across Google's fleet. VCCs impose hourly limits on resources available to temporally flexible workloads while preserving overall daily capacity, enabling all such workloads to complete within a day with high probability. Data from Google's in-production operation shows that VCCs effectively limit hourly capacity when the grid's energy supply mix is carbon intensive and delay the execution of temporally flexible workloads to 'greener' times. © 1969-2012 IEEE."

Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional online survey was used to collect quantitative data on sustainability knowledge, behaviors and attitudes among 291 undergraduate college students at a mid-size Midwestern US university. This study used a structural equation model to answer the research questions. Findings: In all, 291 students completed a sustainability attitudes and behaviors survey. The results of this study show sustainability knowledge is poor (average score 5.3/10). Statistical modeling indicates positive influence of economic attitudes on sustainable behaviors; however, ecology and social attitudes were not associated with sustainable behaviors. Furthermore, those with greater sustainable knowledge engaged in fewer sustainable behaviors. Practical implications: Sustainability and/or wellness initiatives can provide education targeting actionable behaviors college students can make to reduce their carbon footprint, including washing clothes in cold water, limiting red meat consumption, recycling, reducing food waste and taking shorter showers. Sustainability initiatives such as organizing a recycling competition and coordinating volunteers for local clean-up days and events such as Earth Day celebrations offer opportunities for collaboration between campus departments and engagement and socialization among students, staff and faculty. The inclusion of sustainability in college curricula may increase students’ knowledge, develop critical thinking skills and self-efficacy related to sustainability and promote climate action. Originality/value: First, this study adds to the literature in terms of the use of structural equation modeling. Second, this study’s results indicate a dissociation between positive sustainable attitudes as they relate to sustainable behaviors. Why is it that students think the environment is important yet do not place importance on sustainable behaviors? These issues are highly relevant and present opportunities for future research and interventions aimed at increasing sustainable behaviors. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."

The structural break unit root test results show that all variables are stationary at first difference. The bound F-test for cointegration affirmed the indications of a long run connection between the parameters in the discussion. Moreover, we use the non-linear autoregressive distributed lag model to check the non-linear links in establishing the associations between financial development and ecological footprint. The outcomes suggest an asymmetric connection between financial development and ecological footprint because positive and negative shocks in financial development have different effects on ecological footprint. The findings reveal that the impact of the positive shock on financial development is negative but insignificant. Besides, the impact of the negative shock on financial development is positive and statistically significant. It implies that a 1% increase in the negative shock of financial development causes a 0.0877% rise in ecological footprint. The coefficient of economic growth is significant at a 1% level of significance. In the long run, a 0.4471% increase in ecological footprint is associated with a 1% increase in economic growth. However, the coefficient of the square of economic growth is negative but insignificant. Thus, the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis is not valid in Pakistan. Likewise, energy consumption positively affects the ecological footprint. The results of short run estimates correspond to the long run estimates. As a policy suggestion, the current study suggests expanding green financial development in Pakistan by emphasizing more on Sustainable Development Goals. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

A discrete fiber-reinforcement advances the ductility and tensile strength of Plain concrete (PC); therefore, Fiber-reinforced concretes (FRCs) require structural dimensions smaller than PC under same tensile loading conditions. In this study, the effect of fiber type and content is evaluated and analyzed on the life cycle cost and CO2-footprint of concrete pavement. Namely three types of fiber-reinforced concretes, i.e., Steel fiber-reinforced concrete (SFC), Glass fiber-reinforced concrete (GFC), and Polypropylene fiber-reinforced concrete (PFC) were considered for pavement application and three different fiber contents, i.e., 0, 0.5 and 1% (by volume). For the case study, location of design pavement was considered in the Islamabad city. Pavement thickness was designed for three types of streets, i.e., residential, collector, and major arterial (consideration for low to high traffic volumes). Analysis of results revealed that for different loading conditions or types of streets, PC pavement produces higher CO2-emission and is uneconomical compared to the FRC pavements. The results show the superiority of SFC over GFC and PFC in overall mechanical performance. SFC has higher associated footprint than other FRCs. Despite lesser mechanical performance compared to SFC; GFCs and PFCs show the highest reductions in the cost and CO2-footprint of the pavement (i.e., Cost per unit area of pavement (CPA) and Global warming potential per unit area of pavement (GWPPA)). © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Chinese Society of Pavement Engineering."

Based on the panel data of 285 cities at or above prefecture level in China during 2009–2019, this study pioneers in adopting difference-in-differences (DID) model with multiple time periods, spatial DID (SDID) model with multiple time periods, and mediating effect to explore the direct influence of ranking on China’s energy efficiency, as well as its spatial effect and influence mechanism. Results show that air quality ranking is of significant positive impact on energy efficiency, proved by parallel trend hypothesis, placebo control, and policy heterogeneity. With spatial effect considered, such impact still exists, and ranking of the experimental group has significant positive spatial spillover effect on efficiency of the control group, meaning the ranking also promotes the efficiency of nearby cities in control groups via spatial spillover effect. In addition, air quality ranking greatly elevates energy efficiency via industrial structure and technological innovation, the mechanism of which is of significant positive spatial spillover effect. Based on the above results, some policy recommendations on environmental competition policy, industrial structure adjustment, and low-carbon applicable technology promotion were proposed to promote the energy efficiency of China. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
1534,Life cycle-carbon footprints for environmental performance/labeling of crop-based food products: analyses of complementary functional units and hotspots,Article,O N.C.; Pak S.C.; Ri R.J.; Han H.I.,International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology,20.0,2023,2375,2388,10.1007/s13762-022-04174-z,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136407022&doi=10.1007%2fs13762-022-04174-z&partnerID=40&md5=77eb9385bbdaf1b69d51eab900ed90b0,17351472,Scopus,Carbon footprint; Environmental hotspot; Environmental labeling; Food product; Functional unit; Life cycle assessment,"Developing a sustainable food industry is the global consensus regarding climate change and food security. This present study aims to take account of life cycle-carbon footprints for the environmental performance/labeling of 20 food products commissioned by the flour processing factory in Pyongyang and to give lessons for the rest consumer products. This study conducts analyses of Functional Units (FUs) and hotspots with a couple of questions of how much are life cycle-carbon footprints per FU of the food products investigated from the company? and what are the key hotspots (primary, secondary, and tertiary) connected to the life cycle phases? The results show that the carbon footprints of food products vary in a range of 2050–5080 g CO2eq. depending on the defined FUs: mass-based FUdry (dry basis), mass-based FUtotal (total basis), and economic value-based FUpri (price basis). The results also reveal that both the mass-based FUdry and economic value-based FUpri might lead to proper environmental benchmarking/labeling of food products, when compared to the mass-based FUtotal that could definitely affect food LCAs. In addition, the results indicate that three subsystems in 20 product systems are identified as environmental hotspots to have improvement potential: flour subsystems (13 primary hotspots), washing and wastewater subsystems (12 secondary hotspots), and electricity subsystems (14 tertiary hotspots), while representing average contributions of 28.58, 23.34 and 16.23% to the total carbon footprints, respectively. The findings could encourage LCA practitioners and commissioners to implement a sustainable policy for environmental performance/labeling of crop-based food products and give lessons for the rest consumer products. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Iranian Society of Environmentalists (IRSEN) and Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University."

Studies have been conducted on the environmental and economic assessment of campuses in specification with the identification of their carbon footprint and cost analysis, respectively. The studies have lacked a showcase of an ideal sustainable campus along with its urban and architectural features, facilities, and services through analyzing their social aspects as well. The objective of this study was to evaluate the sustainability of the Abdullah Gul University Sumer Campus to model a sustainable campus integrating the Environmental Life Cycle Assessment(E-LCA), the Life Cycle Costing (LCC) and the Social Life Cycle Assessment using life cycle sustainability assessment approaches for the use-phase analysis of the campus. E-LCA was applied to quantify the global warming potential and cumulative energy demand based on International Organization for Standardization 14,040 and 14,044 by considering the gate-to-gate approach. The environmental assessment results showed that the global warming potential of the campus was 2.92 tCO2 eq./person, and the cumulative energy demand was found as 15.4 GJ/person. In LCC, the total cost of the campus was calculated as 200 US Dollars/person, and the energy cost is found as a major contributor with 86% of the total cost for the year of 2019. In the social performance assessment, it is found that the university has a weak social performance for the local community, the consumer, the worker, and the society. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Iranian Society of Environmentalists (IRSEN) and Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University."

Moreover, there is a substantial increase in globalization and electricity consumption for the same period, and transportation is contributing to economic prosperity at the cost of environmental sustainability. Understanding the determinants of ecological footprint is thus critical for suggesting appropriate policies for environmental sustainability. As a result, this study analyzes the impacts of economic globalization, transportation, coal rents, and electricity consumption in ecological footprint in the context of the USA over the period 1995 to 2018. The data have been extracted from “Global Footprint Network,” “Swiss Economic Institute,” and “World Development Indicators.” The current study has also applied the flexible Fourier form nonlinear unit root test to examine the stationarity among variables. For the empirical estimation, a novel technique, the “quantile auto-regressive distributive lag model,” is applied in the study to deal with the nonlinear associations of the variables and to evaluate the long-term stability of variables across quantiles. The study’s findings indicate that coal rents, transportation, and globalization significantly and positively contribute to the deterioration of ecological footprints at different quantile ranges in the short and long run. Electricity consumption is found to have a positive and significant impact at lower quantile ranges in the long run but not have a significant impact in the short run. The study suggested that lowering the dependence of the transport sector on fossil fuels, more use of hydroelectricity, and stringent strategies to curb coal consumption would be helpful to reduce the positive influence of these variables on ecological footprints in the USA.

However, on easy-to-collect occasions, recovery of biodegradable plastics is a preferable option rather than biodegradation, since it can fully utilize carbon resources and reduce carbon emissions. Herein, efficient and eco-friendly recycling of widely used biodegradable plastic, polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT), was demonstrated by alkaline hydrolysis in the solution of ethanol and H2O. The degradation ratio of PBAT was achieved above 99% at 80 °C for 50 min. Diacid salts were self-precipitated out from the reaction solution, followed by acidification to obtain diacid monomers. The reaction solution after filtrating away the diacid salts can be recycled several times without sacrificing the degradation ratio of PBAT, while 1,4-butanediol monomer can be further recovered by the two-step mild distillation at 80 °C. The carbon emission of the whole recycling process was evaluated, and it was only half of that of the biodegradation.

Biological treatment methods are environmentally friendly as they rely on the natural activity of ubiquitous microbes to produce extracellular polymeric saccharides (EPS) and calcite cements. EPS extruded by microbes exhibit strong adhesion from growth of fibrous bridges and bonds between surfaces. In situ polysaccharide secretion in soils to improve their engineering properties has not been examined. In this study, pulverised dried cattle manure (CM) are is used for in situ EPS production in a synthetic soft soil specimen. The indigenous facultative anaerobes and aerobes in animal waste produce negatively charged EPS molecules in the soil specimen. Bridging of sand particles and embedment of CM fibres in kaolinite aggregates caused an immediate increase in unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of the stabilised specimen. EPS cementation improved soil strength by filling pores and engulfing kaolinite aggregates into bonded mass. Fibre reinforcement and bio-stabilisation by CM increased the UCS of the soil by 740%. Replacing C-intensive lime/cement binders by CM as a stabilising agent has the potential to prevent release of 1 t of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere per tonne of lime/cement consumed.  © 2021 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved."

However, none of the existing studies has thought to investigate their combined effects on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Additionally, the individual investigations into the nexuses EPU-emissions and EPS-emissions primarily took a symmetric assumption between these variables into consideration. The current paper is an early attempt to close these gaps by examining the combined effects of economic policy uncertainty and environmental policy stringency on CO2 emissions within asymmetric (nonlinear) frameworks in China and the United States (US). The empirical findings indicate that an improvement in EPU degrades the environmental quality in both countries. However, a negative shift in EPU decreases emissions in China while increasing them in the US. In terms of EPS, the estimates in the two nations led to similar results. A positive change in EPS is conducive to fewer emissions, whereas a negative change worsens environmental damage. These findings still hold with the sensitivity analysis using ecological footprint as an alternative gauge of environmental destruction. This study, therefore, suggests that both nations adopt stricter environmental policies. Additionally, Chinese policymakers should work to lessen uncertainty shocks, while the US government should promote more transparent economic policies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Adducts of SP with silica were prepared (SP ≈ 9% by mass), with very high yield. In the whole process, from reagents to adducts, only substances from natural sources could be used, and the only co-product was water and the carbon efficiency was close to 100%. The silica/SP adduct was used in an elastomeric composite based on diene elastomers such as poly(styrene-co-butadiene) and poly(1,4-cis-isoprene) from Hevea brasiliensis. Comparison was made with a composite containing silica and a traditional coupling agent, a sulfur-based silane, bis(triethoxysilylpropyl)tetrasulfide (TESPT). SP appears to behave as a coupling agent for silica. To have similar properties for the SP and TESPT-based composites, tuning of the formulation of the composite with silica/SP has to be performed. Model reactions revealed the condensation of the OH of SP with the SiOR groups of an alkoxysilane, the reaction of the pyrrole ring with sulfur and a thiyl radical and the reaction of the sulfurated pyrrole ring with the unsaturation of squalene. SP appears thus able to establish covalent bonds with both silica and the unsaturated elastomer. With SP, the release of ethanol, which occurs from the silanization of silica with TESPT and is usually burned in industrial plants to give CO2, is avoided. This work paves the way for the development at the industrial scale of elastomeric composites which allow remarkable reduction of the carbon footprint of the tire technology. © 2023 The Authors.

However, there has not been much research done on how environmentally friendly technologies and institutional quality affect pollution levels. It is found that in developed countries, the rate of environmental deterioration has slowed thanks to more sustainable environmental regulations, advances in technology, and improvements in the quality of institutions. In contrast, limited modern technology in developing nations has resulted in havens of high carbon emissions. Therefore, the current research tried to analyze the environmental quality by using green technologies (GT), institutional quality (IQ), and energy efficiency (EE) as independent variables. In this study, we utilized data from 1995 to 2019 from BRICS countries to estimate long-term and short-term relationships. Used second-generation econometric techniques indicated that IQ, GT, and EE repair reduced environmental damage. The EKC does not exist, which means pollution in selected countries will improve with an expansion in economic activities. In the long term, a reform in institutions and more spending are required on green technologies to secure a sustainable future in BRICS countries.

Emerging alternatives to mitigate such high energy costs propose to efficiently distribute, or federate, the learning tasks across devices, which are typically low-power. This paper proposes a novel framework for the analysis of energy and carbon footprints in distributed and federated learning (FL). The proposed framework quantifies both the energy footprints and the carbon equivalent emissions for vanilla FL methods and consensus-based fully decentralized approaches. We discuss optimal bounds and operational points that support green FL designs and underpin their sustainability assessment. Two case studies from emerging 5G industry verticals are analyzed: these quantify the environmental footprints of continual and reinforcement learning setups, where the training process is repeated periodically for continuous improvements. For all cases, sustainability of distributed learning relies on the fulfillment of specific requirements on communication efficiency and learner population size. Energy and test accuracy should be also traded off considering the model and the data footprints for the targeted industrial applications.  © 2023 IEEE."

This study attempts to reexamine the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis by using ecological footprint as an indicator of environmental degradation. Besides, our study aims to test the validity of environmental Phillips curve (EPC) and role of clean energy on ecological footprint. Our data cover a panel of 36 OECD countries from 1995 to 2015. We adopt the second-generation panel unit root and cointegration test to account for the presence of cross-section dependence (CSD). Moreover, the long-run relationship is estimated using Common Correlated Effect Mean Group (CCEMG) and Augmented Mean Group (AMG) that are robust to CSD. Our findings reveal that the EKC hypothesis is not valid while EPC is confirmed in OECD countries. Though there is a trade-off between unemployment and environmental degradation in OECD countries, the development of new technologies, especially in the clean energy sector, could be a key factor contributing to sustainable growth and better environmental quality. Thus, it is recommended that OECD countries should focus on the development of innovative green technologies and strengthen the initiatives that promote renewable energy consumption. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Rather than producing a single fuel product, lignocellulosic biorefineries have the potential to serve as hubs for the production of fuels, production of petrochemical replacements, and treatment of high-moisture organic waste. A detailed techno-economic analysis and life-cycle greenhouse gas assessment are developed to explore the cost and emission impacts of integrated corn stover-to-ethanol biorefineries that incorporate both codigestion of organic wastes and different strategies for utilizing biogas, including onsite energy generation, upgrading to bio-compressed natural gas (bioCNG), conversion to poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) bioplastic, and conversion to single-cell protein (SCP). We find that codigesting manure or a combination of manure and food waste alongside process wastewater can reduce the biorefinery’s total costs per metric ton of CO2 equivalent mitigated by half or more. Upgrading biogas to bioCNG is the most cost-effective climate mitigation strategy, while upgrading biogas to PHB or SCP is competitive with combusting biogas onsite. © 2023 The Authors.

Despite the increasing recognition of its importance to achieve the net-zero target, current CCS deployment is far behind targeted ambitions. A key reason is that CCS is often perceived as too expensive. The costs of CCS have however traditionally been looked at from the industrial plant perspective, which does not necessarily reflect the end user’s one. This paper addresses the incomplete view by investigating the impact of implementing CCS in industrial facilities on the overall costs and CO2 emissions of end-user products and services. As an example, we examine the extent to which an increase in costs of raw materials (cement and steel) due to CCS impacts the costs of building a bridge. Results show that although CCS significantly increases cement and steel costs, the subsequent increment in the overall bridge construction cost remains marginal (∼1%). This 1% cost increase, however, enables a deep reduction in CO2 emissions (∼51%) associated with the bridge construction.

The impact is mainly driven by the intermittency and variability of DERs typically connected at the edge. Traditional centralized optimal voltage control lacks scalability, and local voltage controls are not optimal. Distributed algorithms are scalable, robust to failures, and possibly require less communication resources compared to centralized. This paper presents a new online distributed voltage control algorithm with primal-dual updates and auxiliary variables for three-phase unbalanced distribution systems. The phase-specific active and reactive power of participating voltage control agents is regulated considering the power converter operational limits. The algorithm is validated to regulate voltage for both static and dynamic loading conditions for three-phase unbalanced IEEE 13 and 123 bus systems modeled in the OpenDSS. The robustness of the algorithm is validated for delayed asynchronous communication, modeling errors, and measurement noises. Simulation results and convergence analysis show the superior performance of the proposed algorithm. © 1969-2012 IEEE."
1551,Heading towards sustainable environment: does renewable and non-renewable energy generation matter for the effect of industrialization and urbanization on ecological footprint? Evidence from China,Article,Hao Y.,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,30.0,2023,34282,34295,10.1007/s11356-022-24476-6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85143746411&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-022-24476-6&partnerID=40&md5=e43bac3c0a37fda2290d29da9946cd5a,09441344,Scopus,ARDL simulations model; Ecological footprint; Environmental Kuznets curve; Industrialization; Renewable and non-renewable energy generation; Urbanization,"This study examines how renewable and non-renewable energy generation interacts with both to affect the ecological footprint in China during 1990–2019 by using FMOLS, DOLS, and CCR estimation techniques and ARDL simulation models to assess the impact of industrialization and urbanization on environmental sustainability based on the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis model framework. Firstly, the findings verify the applicability and validity of the EKC hypothesis in China. Secondly, renewable energy generation, industrialization, and urbanization facilitate the reduction of ecological footprint and the improvement of environmental quality in the long run, while non-renewable energy generation increases the ecological footprint and leads to the intensification of ecological pollution. However, the short-term estimates give evidence that industrialization, urbanization, and renewable and non-renewable energy generation can all increase the ecological footprint, which is not conducive to ecological sustainability. Thus, from the perspective of ecological sustainability in China, our findings are important in that they provide clear directions for ecological policy formulation, and we also provide some targeted policy recommendations for them to promote sustainable development as a goal. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

The scenario under study involves the optimal allocation and migration of time-sensitive computing tasks in a resource-constrained Internet of Vehicles (IoV) context. This is achieved by tackling, as the main objective, the minimization of the carbon footprint of the edge network, whilst delivering adequate quality of service (QoS) to the end users (e.g., meeting task execution deadlines). EASE integrates i) a centralized optimization step, solved through model predictive control (MPC), to manage the renewable energy that is locally collected at the edge servers and their local computing resources, estimating their future availability, and ii) a distributed consensus step, solved via dual ascent in closed form, to reach agreement on service migrations. EASE is compared with four existing migration strategies. Quantitative results demonstrate its greater energy efficiency, which often gets close to complete carbon neutrality, while also improving the QoS.  © 2023 IEEE."

Dealing with biowaste by anaerobic digestion disposes of wastes and produces biogas during the treatment processes for providing the renewable energy source at a low cost while conserving fossil fuel. This study uses life cycle assessment and cost-benefit analysis to evaluate and compare environmental impacts and cost benefits before and after installing a rapid-build anaerobic fermentor module into the three-stage wastewater treatment system that the swine farm initially used. The module helps biogas production as energy recovery in swine farms. The results indicate that the module could help reduce carbon footprint by 22.6%, methane by 51.8%, sulfur oxides by 92.6%, nitrogen oxides by 74.2%, carbon monoxide by 54.7%, nitrous oxide by 28.6%, suspended particulate by 95.4%, and non-methane volatile organic compounds by 80%. Using this module made the reductions of damage impacts were human health 82%, ecosystem quality 59%, and resource scarcity 87%. The daily average biogas production was 46.38 m3, and its annual electricity generation income was 6091 USD. This study allows identifying the lowest environmental impact to support the adoption of sustainable waste treatment and the opportunity for converting waste to be energy and utilization with economic benefits for small-scale swine farms.

Detailed knowledge about the inclusion levels for pikeperch (Sander lucioperca), a promising candidate for intensive aquaculture in Europe remains, however, fragmented. In the present study, 4 isoproteic (45% dry matter) and isoenergetic (21 MJ/kg) diets were formulated, including a control diet (H0) containing 30% fishmeal (FM) on an as-fed basis and the other 3 diets in which FM protein was replaced by defatted black soldier fly (Hemetia illucens) meal (HIM) at 25%, 50%, and 100% (diet abbreviation H9, H18 and H36, corresponding to an inclusion level of 9%, 18% and 36%, respectively). The feeding trial was performed in triplicate groups of 50 juvenile pikeperch (mean weight, 68.7 g) fed with experimental diets for 84 d during which the growth performance, nutrient digestibility, fillet quality and economic and environmental sustainability of rearing pikeperch were evaluated. Our findings indicated that pikeperch in H0, H9, and H18 groups displayed better results regarding growth performance indices, except for survival rate where no significant difference among groups was recorded (P = 0.642). A significantly lower organ-somatic index, including hepatosomatic, viscerosomatic and perivisceral fat index, was found in fish in H18 groups than other groups (P < 0.05). Inclusion of HIM affected the digestibility of the nutrients and resulted in an almost linear reduction in the apparent digestibility coefficient of dry matter and protein. Concerning the fillet quality, dietary HIM negatively affected the protein and ash contents of the fish fillets, while the crude fat remained unchanged. Dietary HIM did not significantly modify total saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids in the fillets of fed pikeperch (P > 0.05) but did reduce total n-3 fatty acids (P = 0.001) and increased total n-6 (P < 0.001). Increasing inclusion levels of HIM reduced the environmental impacts associated with fish in-to-fish out ratio but entailed heavy burdens on energy use and eutrophication. Low and moderate inclusion levels of HIM did not negatively affect land use and water use compared to an HIM-free diet (P > 0.05). The addition of HIM at a level as low as 9% elicited a similar carbon footprint to that of the control diet. The economic conversion ratio and economic profit index were negatively affected at increased insect meal inclusion levels. This study has shown that the incorporation of HIM in feed formulations for pikeperch is feasible at inclusion levels of 18% without adverse effects on growth performance parameters. The feasibility also highlighted the environmental benefits associated with land use and marine resources required to produce farmed fish. © 2022 Chinese Association of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine"

To ensure high service availability, low carbon footprint, and optimal profit distribution, optimal usage of the available resources while maintaining optimal contribution of VOs in the multi-sensor-cloud (MSC) market is necessary. Additionally, a single SCSP may lose revenue due to the absence of compatible sensor-equipped vehicles (SVs) to serve user requests. To address these issues, we propose FRAME, a game-theoretic resource allocation scheme, for vehicular MSC. Initially, we use a single-leader-multiple-followers Stackelberg game to decide the optimal set of SVs for serving a request while ensuring high QoS, low energy consumption, and optimal profit distribution among the SCSPs and VOs. Further, to address the inadequacy of resources, we propose a collaboration scheme using the expected utility theory for multiple SCSPs and choose the optimal SCSP to serve the requests. We evaluate the performance of FRAME theoretically and experimentally and compare it with benchmark schemes. Simulation results depict a 4.14-27.3% increase in served requests, a 14.61-22.83% decrease in energy consumption, and optimal profit distribution among the SCSP and VOs.  © 2023 IEEE."

First, the EPECF of 48 sub industries is calculated, then divides 48 sub-industries into high-, medium-, and low-pressure industries, and uses the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) method to analyze and summarize the main driving forces of China’s industrial EPECF changes. Finally, policy suggestions for the future industrial decompression are put forward. The main results are as follows: (1) Economic development is the most important factor to promote the growth of EPECF of the three major industries. (2) At present, the population pressure factors of forest and grassland have little effect, and the effect of returning farmland to forest and grassland has not been truly played. (3) The adjustment of industrial structure has gradually become a key factor in reducing EPECF of the three industries. (4) The gradual stability of energy intensity has a certain inhibitory effect on the increase of EPECF in high-pressure industry. (5) The adjustment of energy structure in low-pressure industry has gradually worked. Therefore, the government should establish an economic sustainable development system, vigorously develop clean energy, and realize the green transformation of various industries. This provides an empirical example for other countries in the world to reduce the EPECF. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

By drawing on two theories – Sirgy’s theory of the self and Sundar’s theory of interactive media effects (TIME) – the study tests a PLS model with two new constructs: Photo Satisfaction and Consumer Inspiration, and their impact on Adoption Intention. Design/methodology/approach: This mixed methods study examines the effects from personalization and customization affordances in the latest generation of apparel VTOs. The proposed model was tested in a quasi-experimental within-subjects design, as 61 female participants completed a goal-directed and an exploratory apparel shopping task using two VTO apps available on the market. Findings: Inspiration induced from the customization affordance in the exploratory task influenced Adoption Intention as strongly as Fit Confidence did. For both conditions, users’ satisfaction with their avatar picture had a stronger effect on Perceived Augmentation than the individual trait of Body Esteem. The study also demonstrates how TIME’s Sense of Agency component could help theorize positive consumer responses to mobile marketing technology, which in our study were induced via the app’s Mix and Match feature. Also demonstrated was that Perceived Augmentation could be influenced by body-image affective judgments made during the pre-task VTO avatar creation phase. Practical implications: VTO’s customization feature “Mix and Match” appears vital for the adoption of such apps for exploratory m-shopping of apparel. Also important is the satisfaction with one's photograph during the avatar-creation phase. We further suggest that apparel retailers work with Augmented Reality developers to include dynamic avatar capability as well as social sharing affordances in VTOs. Social implications: 60 billion USD worth of returns occur annually in the online apparel retail industry, mostly related to fitting problems, not to mention the larger carbon footprint from the increased transportation. A more wide-spread adoption of VTOs can not only help with these problems but also lighten the traffic in brick and mortar fitting rooms, a potential hazard at this time of pandemic. Originality/value: This is the first study to examine Consumer Inspiration in the context of online apparel retailing and to demonstrate the importance of Photo Satisfaction during the avatar-creation phase in influencing the subsequent user experience in apparel VTOs. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."

It also aimed to substantiate the applicability and benefits of the programme through analysing the findings and measuring patient satisfaction. Methods We identified the operational, logistical, technological and legal needs, as well as the need for training, information and coordination with the care team and patient associations. A standard operating procedure was developed which described the home dispensing model and the profile of patients eligible for telepharmacy. Care activity was evaluated, between the months of July 2020 and January 2021; and a survey was conducted to measure patient satisfaction based on the Enopex project, a cross-sectional observational study of patients who used telepharmacy services during the COVID-19 lockdown period in Spain. Results A total of 2536 medication deliveries were made over 144 working days, with a mean of 18 (standard deviation (SD): 6) deliveries per day, and a total of 2854 dispensings (1.1 drugs per delivery). In total, 197 different types of pharmaceutical formulations were delivered, corresponding to 123 active ingredients. The distance and time avoided during the study period totalled 1 05 624 km and 1 09 452 min (76 days), whereby the median distance and time saved per patient were 66 (interquartile range (IQR):122 km and 90 (IQR:90) minutes, which represents an approximate carbon footprint reduction of 25 kg of CO 2 per patient and 16.5 tonnes in total. The satisfaction survey conducted, completed by 134 patients, revealed high satisfaction with the pharmacy service of 9.88 points out of 10. Conclusions The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (COVID-19) has provided the pharmacy service with an opportunity to develop and implement a telepharmacy programme that benefits patients, which has enabled better organisation of the unit and greater accessibility for patients attending in person. It is a replicable method that is applicable in other pharmacy services with similar characteristics and requirements. © 2023 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved."

Nevertheless, empirical research on the impact of global uncertainties on environmental quality is lacking. This study contributes to the literature by examining the impact of economic policy uncertainty (EPU), geopolitical risk (GPR), and economic complexity on the ecological footprint and carbon emissions of E7 economies for the period 1995–2018. Our empirical results indicate a long-term relationship between economic complexity, EPU, GPR, energy consumption, and two environmental quality indicators, carbon dioxide emissions and ecological footprint. In the long run, a divergence from disequilibrium takes 3 years to return to the equilibrating position. The environmental effects of key determinants are different in terms of direction, magnitude, and time span. Specifically, an inverted U-shape describes the relationship between economic complexity and environmental degradation in the long-term only, which confirms the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. The environmental effects of EPU and GPR are harmful in the short run but prove to be beneficial in the long run. Higher energy consumption significantly degrades environment quality as expected. Based on these findings, the paper provides several useful suggestions for policymakers in the context of E7 countries. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

The use of biodegradable detergents as an environmentally friendly alternative has been proposed in different regions. In Colombia, resolution 1770/2018 sets a minimum biodegradability rate of 60% for the surfactants present in liquid detergents, which would reduce to a similar extent the impacts on water after their use. However, the environmental impacts of the supply chain of these detergents and their raw materials have not been evaluated so far. This study presents an environmental life cycle assessment of petroleum-based liquid detergents and a comparison to traditional solid detergents, based on the ISO 14040 standard and the ReCiPe-2016 impacts assessment method. A novel bio-detergent containing anionic plant-based surfactants was proposed in this analysis. The impacts of packaging and the distribution of the product to consumers were also considered. Raw materials contributed to 91% of the total of 314 g of CO2 eq generated per liter of liquid detergent, where the production of fatty alcohol sulfate and PET packaging shared 78.8% and 12.2% of the total impact, respectively. It was also determined that 5.4 L of water are consumed and 0.09 g of P eq and 0.1 g of N eq are emitted per liter of detergent. This liquid detergent presented better environmental performance than traditional detergents in all the impact categories, except for the fossil resource scarcity category. The evaluated detergent would significantly mitigate the generation of negative effects on ecosystems. Moreover, the substitution of PET for HDPE packaging could reduce the impacts on freshwater eutrophication by 10%, although the carbon footprint can slightly increase, which could be compensated due to its higher recyclability rate. In contrast, the proposed bio-detergent would not have significant benefits and would negatively affect water consumption and land use in its supply chain. © 2022, The Author(s)."

Bins should be located conveniently to encourage recycling and reduce waste. The current model of bin location-allocation is mostly determined by distance. However, it has been identified that previous studies excluded an important factor: litter pattern identification. Litter pattern is important to identify waste generation hotspots and litter distribution. Thus, we proposed the within cluster pattern identification (WCPI) approach to optimize the recycle point distribution. WCPI gathers the information on litter distribution using geotagged images and analyses the pattern distribution. The optimal location for recycle bin can be identified by incorporating k-means clustering to the pattern distribution. Since k-means faces the non-deterministic polynomial-time-hard challenge of selecting the ideal cluster and cluster centre, WCPI used the total within-cluster sum of square on top of k-means clustering. The proposed location by WCPI is validated in terms of accessibility and suitability. Furthermore, this study provides further analysis of carbon footprint that can be reduced by simulating the data from geotagged images. The results show that 10,323.55 kg of carbon emission can be reduced if the litter is sent for recycling. Thus, we believe that locating bins at an optimal location will embark on consumer motivation to dispose of recycled waste, reduce litter and lessen the carbon footprint. At the same time, these efforts could transform Malaysia into a clean and sustainable nation that aims to achieve Agenda 2030. © The Author(s) 2022."

PHDI incorporates two biophysical consumption-based indicators (CO2 emissions and material footprint, MF) as a proxy of environmental pressures into traditionally socioeconomic development-focused HDI. This work spans 164 nations and 27 years (1990–2016). Various statistical techniques such as Pearson’s correlation, hierarchical clustering (HCA), generalised additive modelling (GAM), data envelopment analysis (DEA), linear regression, and ARIMA forecasting have been used to explore interrelationships, non-linearity, efficiency analysis, and future projections (up to 2030) and delve into two scenarios: high human development and for human development permitted only within the two planetary boundaries (PBs) (viz. climate change and material footprint) and their consequences when exceeded. Though most of the countries with high PHDI and PIHDI scores are from the global north and have a high income, it is also possible to attain human development (i.e. increase PHDI and PIHDI scores) without overexploiting biophysical resources. From 2016, human development scores could increase by 55–63% (climate change) or 30–46% (material consumption) within a safe operating space in 2030. Without the required focus on the environment, aiming for a superior score in PHDI and PIHDI could result in 43–58% (CO2 emissions) or 57–58% (material footprint) of countries that would exceed PB. Based on the outcome of this work, it can be recommended that governments and policymakers that it is well within the limits of feasibility as well as necessary to make human socioeconomic development aspire to sustainability to address the needs of humanity, while respecting the well-being of the surrounding biosphere. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Using CO2-containing flue gases as a feedstock in chemical conversions of CO2 can help simplify pre-treatment of CO2 and reduce the carbon footprint of the process, however, study of the effects of other components in the flue gases in chemical reactions using CO2 is limited. Our previous study demonstrated that the combination catalyst system of CeO2 and 2-cyanopyridine was effective for the reaction of pure CO2, aniline, and 2-propanol to afford isopropyl N-phenylcarbamate, which is a promising precursor for polyurethane, in over 90% yield. In this study, the addition effect of other components in CO2-containing flue gases namely N2, O2, SO2 (ppm-order) and NO2 (ppm-order) on the reaction was investigated. The addition of N2 and NO2 had almost no influence on the catalytic performance, however, that of O2 and SO2 had some negative effects. The addition of O2 decreased the selectivity and yield to the target carbamate due to the formation of aniline-derived byproducts such as aniline-coupling products and aniline-oligomers. The increase of the amount of 2-cyanopyridine and 2-propanol was effective for the suppression of the aniline-derived byproducts, providing a similar yield of the isopropyl N-phenylcarbamate to the case without any additives. The catalyst system was strongly poisoned by addition of SO2, and the activity of CeO2 was not recovered even by calcination treatment. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."

Using market capitalization as a size metric, 50 mining, oil, and gas companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) were included in the research sample. Sustainability reports were subjected to quantitative and qualitative content analysis to identify keyword occurrences that were pertinent to the investigation. The findings revealed that environmental protection, emissions, carbon footprint, climate change, biodiversity, nature, planet, effluent, and conservation were addressed in the companies’ sustainability reports. This study confirmed, in line with research on other industries, that the intensity of communication on these topics varies with company size. It was also found that, although some companies discuss many keywords that correspond to the Global Reporting Initiative, they are irrelevant because the reports do not show the companies’ commitment and efforts to achieve the concepts. The practical implication of this research is that companies should show more commitment in their efforts to address environmental issues – sustainability disclosure is not just about words. © 2023 Conscientia Beam.

Unscrambling the structural footprint of DOM is key to understand its biogeochemical transformations at the mechanistic level. Although numerous studies have improved our knowledge of DOM chemical makeup, its three-dimensional picture remains largely unrevealed. In this work, we compare four solid phase extracted (SPE) DOM samples from three different freshwater ecosystems using high resolution mobility and ultrahigh-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance tandem mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS/MS). Structural families were identified based on neutral losses at the level of nominal mass using continuous accumulation of selected ions-collision induced dissociation (CASI-CID)FT-ICR MS/MS. Comparison of the structural families indicated dissimilarities in the structural footprint of this sample set. The structural family representation using Cytoscape software revealed characteristic clustering patterns among the DOM samples, thus confirming clear differences at the structural level (Only 10% is common across the four samples.). The analysis at the level of neutral loss-based functionalities suggests that hydration and carboxylation are ubiquitous transformational processes across the three ecosystems. In contrast, transformation mechanisms involving methoxy moieties may be constrained in estuarine systems due to extensive upstream lignin biodegradation. The inclusion of the isomeric content (mobility measurements at the level of chemical formula) in the structural family description suggests that additional transformation pathways and/or source variations are possible and account for the dissimilarities observed. While the structural character of more and diverse types of DOM samples needs to be assessed and added to this database, the results presented here demonstrate that Graph-DOM is a powerful tool capable of providing novel information on the DOM chemical footprint, based on structural interconnections of precursor molecules generated by fragmentation pathways and collisional cross sections. © 2023 American Chemical Society."

Here, we explore hydrogen production from waste polymer gasification (wPG) to reduce the environmental impacts of plastic incineration and landfilling while generating a valuable product. We assess the carbon footprint of 13 H2 production routes and their environmental sustainability relative to the planetary boundaries (PBs) defined for seven Earth-system processes, covering H2 from waste polymers (wP; polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene), and a set of benchmark technologies including H2 from natural gas, biomass, and water splitting. Our results show that wPG coupled with carbon capture and storage (CCS) could reduce the climate change impact of fossil-based and most electrolytic routes. Moreover, due to the high price of wP, wPG would be more expensive than its fossil- and biomass-based analogs but cheaper than the electrolytic routes. The absolute environmental sustainability assessment (AESA) revealed that all pathways would transgress at least one downscaled PB, yet a portfolio was identified where the current global H2 demand could be met without transgressing any of the studied PBs, which indicates that H2 from plastics could play a role until chemical recycling technologies reach a sufficient maturity level. © 2023 The Authors.

The BRICS, containing five emerging economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), recently announced Iran, Egypt, Argentina, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE as six potential new members. This expansion offers promising prospects for advancing environmental sustainability through green finance, which can be an excellent tool. In this respect, this research examines how green finance affects the carbon footprint in BRICS+6 economies. Earlier studies used panel data techniques to probe the association between these variables but overlooked that certain countries still needed to possess such a link separately. Hence, this research adopts the Quantile-on-Quantile approach, which provides a holistic universal view and customized findings for each country. The outcomes display that green finance improves environmental quality by diminishing carbon footprint at distinct quantiles of data distribution."

However, the carbon footprint estimation of the products requires material and manufacturing information that is typically not available at the early design stage. In this study, a novel method is proposed for carbon footprint estimation, which can evaluate the carbon footprint through the shape recognition of computer aided design (CAD) models based on the graph deep learning. The learning model utilizes the boundary representation of CAD models for deeper understandings of the CAD model shape. The proposed method trains the deep learning model on the existing CAD models to recognize important sub-shapes and attributes, including materials and manufacturing information, such as welded parts, which are the essential data for the carbon footprint estimation. The proposed method enables the designers to estimate the carbon footprint without the laborious condition setting, which facilitates concurrent monitoring and improvement of the carbon footprint. The method is applied to actual assembly models and demonstrated that the material and welded parts, which are attributes required for emission prediction, can be recognized with an accuracy of more than 80%."

The stated choice experiment, used for evaluation, was designed combining a set of alternatives, characterised by carbon footprint reduction and offset policies, taking into account the existence of environmental direct benefits, but also indirect benefits that improve tourist experience or co-benefits derived from the location of policy projects. Economic welfare in form of willingness to pay (WTP) was estimated, and the alternatives were compared using compensating variation values. The study's findings validate the prevailing preference for carbon reduction policies over offsetting measures, except when the first don't have co-benefits and the latter are implemented locally. In the latter case, there is no significant difference in WTP between reducing the carbon footprint and locally offsetting it. Results not only contributes to the ongoing economic debate surrounding CC mitigation policies but also provides key information for designing mitigation schemes in diffuse emission sectors such as tourism."

The main objective of this evaluation is to examine the effects of different degrees of decentralization in production networks of the chemical industry. Using the production of a biopolymer as an example, the study includes strategic supply chain planning by agent-based simulations, economic evaluation by calculation of net present values and environmental assessment by calculation of carbon footprints. By allowing for dynamic reconfiguration of the decentralized networks over time, it is shown that mobile, modular plant concepts are beneficial to reduce supply chain expenses. Transportation efforts resulting from strategic supply chain planning are reduced by 40 % with increasing degree of decentralization. The profitability of the decentralized networks is dominated by the costs for the production processes themselves as capital and operational expenditures allocate to >50 % of the total costs. Product prices of 3000 to 5500 €2020 per ton are necessary to reach profitability of the decentralized production networks. Regarding the environmental assessment, the carbon footprint of the supply chain accounts for <3 % of the total emissions, which are dominated by the provision of process heat that accounts for 46 to 68 % of the total emissions. Carbon footprint of the decentral production networks can be significantly reduced by a systematic electrification of 90 % of the process heat demand."

Within surgery, reducing the number of instruments that are sterilized and disposable supplies that are used for each operation may help achieve both goals. We wanted to measure the existing variability in surgical instrument and supply choices and assess whether standardization could have a meaningful cost and environmental impact. Methods We analyzed surgeon preference cards for common general surgery operations at our hospital to measure the number of sterilizable instrument trays and supplies used by each surgeon for each operation. From this data, we calculated supply costs, carbon footprint, and median operative time and studied the variability in each of these metrics. Results Among the ten operations studied, variability in sterilizable instrument trays requested on surgeon preference cards ranged from one to eight. Variability in disposable supplies requested ranged from 17 to 45. Variability in open supply costs ranged from $104 to $4184. Variability in carbon footprint ranged from 17 to 708 kg CO2e. If the highest-cost surgeon for each operation switched their preference card to that of the median-cost surgeon, $245,343 in open supply costs and 41,708 kg CO2e could be saved. Conclusions There is significant variability in the instrument and supply choices of surgeons performing common general surgery operations. Standardizing this variability may lead to meaningful cost savings and carbon footprint reduction, especially if scaled across the entire health system."

Based on carbon emissions and carbon intensity measures, a positive and highly significant association between political connected (PCON) firms and carbon footprint was documented. The study also found that the carbon footprint results were largely driven by direct carbon emissions, while the effect of political connections was stronger for state owned enterprise (SOE). The baseline findings were found to be robust to endogeneity test. Further tests revealed that higher carbon footprint emitted from PCON firms was more pronounced in advanced economies, and in carbon-intensive industries. However, the study found that stronger institutional governance could partially alleviate the significant and positive association between PCON firms and carbon footprint."

The present systematic review aimed to review the current literature assessing the carbon footprint of surgical procedures in different surgical fields. Following to the PRISMA statement checklist, three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library) were searched by independent reviewers, who screened records on title and abstract first, and then on the full text. Risk of bias was evaluated using the MINORS system. Over the 878 articles initially identified, 36 original studies were included. They considered ophthalmologic surgical procedures (30.5%), general/digestive surgery (19.4%), gynecologic procedures (13.9%), orthopedic procedures (8.3%), neurosurgery (5.5%), otolaryngology/head and neck surgery (5.5%), plastic/dermatological surgery (5.5%), and cardiac surgery (2.8%). Despite a great methodological heterogeneity, data showed that a single surgical procedure emits 4–814 kgCO2e, with anesthetic gases and energy consumption representing the largest sources of greenhouse gas emission. Minimally invasive surgical techniques may require more resources than conventional open surgery, particularly for packaging and plastics, energy use, and waste production. Each OR has the potential to produce from 0.2 to 4kg of waste per case with substantial differences depending on the type of intervention, hospital setting, and geographic area. Overall, the selected studies were found to be of moderate quality. Based on a qualitative synthesis of the available literature, the OR can be targeted by programs and protocols implemented to reduce the carbon footprint and improve the waste stream of the OR."

From a global warming perspective, in 2018, Iran was the seventh-highest greenhouse gas emitter in the world. An implementation should demonstrate that it is possible to estimate the environmental impact of climate change. A simple carbon footprint estimation model for waste-to-energy power plants with a life cycle assessment using the 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines is presented in this study. For this purpose, first the system boundary is determined. Then, the total emissions of each part within boundary are identified in terms of total greenhouse gas emission (and expressed in mass of carbon dioxide equivalent). In conclusion, the carbon footprint of generating one kWh of electricity is estimated. The final emission of the Tehran power plant is calculated at 24.46 ktCO2eq/year. Thus, the carbon footprint is estimated to be 1351.94 g CO2eq/kWh. Key parameters that affect carbon footprint are divided into two groups: emission parameters and electricity generation parameters. The sensitivity analysis of effective parameters showed the distance travelled and weight of waste transported during waste transportation, the fossil carbon content in waste composition has the highest effect on carbon footprint. The study shows a 1.2-fold difference between the carbon footprint of two current scenarios of waste treatment: landfill and waste-to-energy plant. The life cycle emissions of landfills exceed of waste-to-energy plants, indicating that these systems can contribute significantly to addressing the current environmental challenges. Additionally, they offer advantages in terms of electricity generation."

Thus, the persistent degradation in the global environment has become a concerning issue for both developed and developing regions across the world. Against this backdrop, this study checks how the per capita carbon footprint figures of the developed Group of Seven (G7) and the developing Emerging Seven (E7) countries are influenced by energy productivity improvement, institutional quality, and other key macroeconomic factors. Considering annual data from 2000 to 2020, advanced panel data estimation techniques that are robust against data-related problems such as endogeneity, heterogeneous slope coefficients, and dependency among the cross-sectional units are utilized. Overall, the results certify that making productive use of energy reduces consumption-based carbon footprints in E7 countries but not in G7 countries. Besides, improving institutional quality is seen to not only reduce carbon footprints in both samples directly but also indirectly mediate and moderate the energy productivity-carbon footprint nexus in G7 and E7 countries, respectively. Moreover, financial globalization is observed to minimize carbon footprints in G7 countries while boosting them in E7 countries. Contrastingly, financial development is observed to homogeneously boost the carbon footprint levels of both G7 and E7 countries. Lastly, international trade is found not to influence the carbon footprint levels in both samples of countries. Therefore, taking these major findings into consideration, a set of policies apart from making optimal use of energy are recommended for inhibiting the consumption-based carbon footprint figures of the concerned countries."

Indeed, the country has realized that it is time to monitor its environmental indicators such as energy consumption, accounting, and carbon footprint to comply with global efforts to reduce carbon footprint and aim for energy efficiency while preserving and optimizing its energy resources. Much attention has been focused on the transportation sector, the second-largest global polluter, which will be the subject of our analysis. Our case study will focus on the evaluation of three vehicles to examine the influence of driver behavior on energy consumption and carbon footprint. Data collection was carried out using UPLOGISTIX, a solution developed by our hosting entity, which aims to present calculations of environmental measures to display the results and ultimately provide recommendations for reducing its carbon footprint. An approach has been proposed to achieve the set objectives. The results of our analysis highlight the existence of a significant relationship between behavioral barriers and energy consumption. Indeed, the behavior of a reckless driver, characterized by abrupt braking, rapid accelerations, and other factors, leads to an actual energy consumption that exceeds recommended standards. This excessive consumption results in a considerable production of CO2 emissions."

A prerequisite for managing and controlling the carbon footprint is calculating and visualizing it transparently. In this work, a general framework for live estimating the carbon footprint for production processes is presented. The framework is used to investigate the carbon footprint of additively manufactured components. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in the straightforwardness of the general framework with a holistic data model. With this it is possible to compare different Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) methods and assumptions of new additively manufactured parts, as all data and methods are integrated from data acquisition at the machine to balancing compactly. A demonstrator is developed that calculates the consumption of energy and materials in real-time. The demonstrator consists of a AM machine, sensors for measuring all consumption, data processing in the back end, and a user-friendly dashboard in the front end. Due to different assumptions and calculation methods, there is a high variation in the final result of the carbon footprint calculation, which is presented in this paper."

However, the embodied environmental impact associated with food consumption is still under discussion, which demands an in-depth analysis of its upstream environmental impact. Therefore, in this study, we consider Japan as a case study and apply an environmentally extended input-output table to tackle its embodied carbon footprint across sectors and regions. To further investigate the contribution of food transport, we extracted transport-related carbon footprints embodied in Japanese food consumption according to six transport types. The results indicate that 34% of the carbon footprints from Japan's food consumption were induced overseas, mostly being leaked in some Asian and Pacific countries (4536 kilo tonCO2eq in China and 4758 kilo tonCO2eq in other Asian and Pacific countries’ group) and the United States (4444 kilo tonCO2eq). The implications of this study reveal the key role of food consumption in Japan's future decarbonization and carbon neutrality, and provide potential mitigation measures to reduce transport emissions from the perspective of food supply chain."

In this context, different philosophies exist. A classic debate, referred to as “boomsters vs. doomsters”, asks whether humanity's drive for technological innovations will mitigate climate change, or whether it is justifiable to compromise our living standards, affluence, and consumption patterns. A Danish research project has elucidated this topic through cross-collaboration between historians and engineers by quantifying the personal consumption-based carbon footprint (CF) of Danish citizens, taking into account the consumption segments of food, transport, housing, and furniture. Quantification is conducted through life-cycle assessments (LCA) of five decadal timesteps during the period 1860–2020. As only one other study conducting historical (retrospective) LCA with an extensive time horizon was identified in the scientific literature, our own study provides novel insights by exploring possible approaches in this field. Historical LCA has many similarities with prospective (future) LCA, providing inspiration to the approach. The main challenge of the study is to adjust both foreground and background systems in the inventory modelling phase. Data is largely based on national statistics, books, museum case studies, expert testimonials, and proxies such as using the steam turbine as an indicator of improvements to technological efficiency over time. The results show a slightly declining carbon footprint in the period 1860–1930, from 7.7 to 6.6 t CO2-eq per capita annually. Unsurprisingly the footprint peak is not found until the 1970s, at 11 t, reducing to 5.4 t in the 2010s. The residential energy consumption segment contributes half of this CF, followed by transportation by road and rail. Discussion of the results shows that whether technology can mitigate the impact from the increase in affluence depends on the specific consumption segment. For housing combined with residential energy, the results show that technology can mitigate increases in CF, despite the comforts of home having only increased over time. For the transportation segment, however, the past century has seen an eightfold increase in CF due to the pronounced evolution of personal modes of transportation. The findings suggests that the “boomsters vs. doomsters” debate is not so black and white after all. We further suggest that historical LCA, in tandem with prospective LCA, can provide valuable insights for decision support to facilitate a green transition and hence a green future."

While originally developed through a nutritional lens, food security is also increasingly incorporating the environmental quality of diets. This study develops a Structural Equation Model to examine how consumers concerns over food insecurity – in terms of its impact on health and poverty – and environmental beliefs influence the carbon footprint of diets. Using data from a survey representative of the Italian population, this study shows that health-related food insecurity concerns increase the use of health motives when shopping for food, in turn reducing the carbon footprint of the diet. Conversely, poverty-related food insecurity concerns are associated to diets higher in carbon footprint, as they reduce health motives, and increase private shopping motives (e.g., taste, low price). Overall, the study highlights how shifts to more sustainable food systems require a better understanding of what motivate consumers to make more sustainable food choices."

Many methods exist to estimate ecological metrics, such as the Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) in the individual product development phases with stand-alone software. However, methods to integrate the PCF in the entire process chain with the possibility to interact in the process are missing. This paper presents a new approach to measuring the ecological impact of an Additive Manufacturing production process, exemplified by the Material Extrusion (MEX) process. The novelty of the approach lies in implementing a single software for machine control, processing, and visualization of sensor signals, parameter variation, and reporting functions to enable comprehensive PCF management. The workflow includes a model-based prediction of the PCF based on the G-code, live monitoring during the production phase, and a subsequent automated evaluation at a central interface. Critical points can be identified, and approaches for optimizing the MEX process can be designed. Uncertainty evaluation of the PCF based on the combination of uncertainty of the sensors and the Life Cycle Assessment is included in the method. The developed prototype software can be used in the design phase for prediction and in the process phase for optimization, enabling seamless PCF management for the MEX process."

Based on literature and a case study, an estimation of CO2 emissions is made. The studied vehicle fleet consists mostly of vehicles with an internal combustion engine (ICEV), and hence the potential reduction of CO2 emissions with this kind of fleet is very limited. Propositions for more sustainable vehicle fleet are made and the potential of car-sharing service in Finland is discussed. The results show that users are replacing sustainable transport modes (walking, cycling) with car-sharing services. Replacing ICEVs with battery electric vehicles (BEV) would allow 31 % decrease in CO2 emissions. However, this would require major changes to the fleet."

Hong Kong's building sector is responsible for approximately 60 % of carbon emissions, while its evolutionary trajectories and neutrality pathway remain unclear. To this end, we adopt the STIRPAT model and machine learning approach to identify the most relevant factors and determine their historical correlation with building energy consumption. Then, the out-of-sample prediction is conducted to explore the energy pathway and carbon footprint towards 2050 in the Hong Kong building sector under various assumptions and scenarios. The predicted results suggest that electricity consumption and carbon emissions will continue to increase following current trends. In a moderate scenario, if 2.2 % and 1.6 % of residential and commercial buildings are replaced annually with 2.75 % better energy-performance construction, their electricity consumption is likely to reach 30 %–40 % and 20 %–30 % from the 2015 level as the HK2050 required. With lower electricity emission intensity, the Hong Kong building sector could achieve near zero emissions. Our projection is valuable for developing energy-saving and emission-mitigation strategies towards various carbon neutrality goals in the building sector."

However, the uncertainty of the emission level of China's food industry alongside the global supply chain restricts China from implementing more sustainable food policies. Thus, this paper first estimates the carbon footprint in China's food manufacturing industry domestically and internationally by identifying major trade partners and the corresponding industries using a multi-regional input-output model. Then, this paper further decomposed the determinants of carbon footprint change. The results show that agriculture, food industry, transport, and energy supply are primarily responsible for carbon emission growth. The structural decomposition results further demonstrate that increasing demand and consumption pattern changes are important factors leading to a growth in carbon emission, and energy efficiency improvement helps China's food industry mitigate the emission level. Finally, policy recommendations are provided based on the decomposition results."

Most emission assessments have focused on the production and use phase of car sharing, but few have focused on the impacts of changes in consumption. In this article I assess changes in the total output from various sectors and in the carbon footprint of car sharing users from a consumption perspective. This study applied a mixed top-down and bottom-up approach using scenario analysis. It is based on a detailed expenditure analysis that links changes in expenditure to variations in the total output of sectors and the carbon footprint of personal mobility using environmentally extended multi regional input and output analysis. The results show that car sharing can change the total output of several sectors, with traceable climate consequences. Variations in total outputs from sectors depend on existing national economic structures. Car sharing users who abandoned private car ownership can decrease their carbon footprint of transport by approximately 40 %. Car sharing users with a car-free lifestyle who started using car sharing for 3 % of their vehicle kilometres travelled increased their transport carbon footprint by 0.42 % to 0.70 %. Meanwhile, the rebound effects of re-spending can be as high as 70 to 85 %. This indicates that the potential carbon savings from car sharing may be drastically reduced by non-transport related consumption. Differences between the carbon footprints of business-to-consumer and peer-to-peer car sharing users were marginal."

Globally, the building sector consumes 40% of the annual energy and emits 30% of the GHGS. The effort is therefore made throughout various phases of planning and design to measure emission levels and energy consumption concerning local climate, living culture, ecology, and construction style. To reduce Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions and energy consumption, international research is being carried out to develop a Building Information Modelling (BIM) based detection system that allows easy estimation of CO2 emissions & energy consumption. Such emissions can then be analysed quickly and objectively, and the necessary changes to support energy-efficient design can be implemented. The study focused on the initial stages of design because choices made at this time determine a large portion of a building's life cycle effects and cannot easily be changed afterwards."

Using official data on tourists' consumption, we calculate the carbon footprint of tourism in Spain in 2019 and 2020 under different recovery pathways, including changes in consumption patterns and emissions efficiency, using a multiregional input-output model. Results show that the carbon footprint of tourism in Spain fell by 63% in 2020 compared to pre-pandemic levels, which would be aligned with the current sectoral decarbonisation target. However, the new tourists’ consumption patterns resulting from the pandemic are insufficient to increase tourism sustainability if they imply pre-pandemic consumption levels. The results provide empirical ground for the binary debate on “recovery or reform”."

Although various studies and approaches are developed, none focus on news broadcasting organisations. Therefore, the carbon footprint of such organisations and carbon emission reduction strategies are not well understood. This lack of knowledge potentially undermines such organisations' sustainability and blocks their contribution to the higher level sustainability goals. To address this gap, for the first time, this study aims to explore and quantify the carbon footprint of news broadcasting organisations. The current study took Nieuwsuur, a Dutch news broadcasting organisation, as a case study. The results demonstrated that the news broadcasting organisation emits 235.28 t of CO2eq yearly. The study categorised the CO2 emissions into five main categories, namely: (i) travel and transport, (ii) office and studio, (iii) accommodation, (iv) materials, and (v) waste, which for each of them sub-categories have been defined and studied. Travel and transport contributed the most to the carbon footprint of such organisations. Within this category, air travel has the most significant share (27 % of total emissions), which cannot be mitigated due to the nature of news broadcasting organisations. In contrast, commuter travel and outsourced travel (together with 37.6 % of total emissions) have considerable potential for reducing carbon emissions. The following categories are office and studio, with 20.7 % of total emissions and materials, with 4.9 % of total emissions. The study recommended that working from home and outsourcing from sustainable companies are the easiest and most effective carbon reduction strategies. Other emissions reduction strategies are discussed for each category, and recommendations are provided."

For quantitative diagnosis of farming performance, the paper presented an on-farm water, energy, food, and carbon-footprint (WEFC) nexus index made up of four equally pillars. The arithmetic average preserved the multi-centric approach and equal importance of the four pillars. The index was applied to test and rank 2,042 wheat-based farmer fields in Egypt representing diverse inputs, agronomic and irrigation practices, soil types, and agroecological conditions. The water metric was the ratio of saved water, difference between maximum water consumption recorded in the country and actual water consumption, to the maximum water consumption. Likewise, the energy metric was obtained. The food metric was the ratio of actual yield to maximum yield in the country. The carbon-footprint metric was the ratio of difference between maximum CO2 emission in the country and actual emission to the maximum emission. The index values showed a wide range from 18.69% to 87.33% with a high standard deviation emphasizing the diversity of farming practices, soil types, and agroecological conditions. The highest ten values were recorded in fields with sandy soils, relatively large area, drip irrigation, recommended seeding and fertilization rates, well drainage, weeds removal, and tillage. The drip irrigation system in 51 out of 52 fields had above average value. The lowest ten values were in fields with clay soils and flood irrigation, where 18.7% of 1,780 fields exceeded the above average value. Raised beds with furrow irrigation in 83.15% of 184 fields exceeded the above average value. Fertilization rates of nitrogen and phosphorus in 61% and 53% of fields respectively exceeded the recommended rates with no significant reflection on the food metric. The low index values in fields with flood irrigation were attributed to high water losses causing high water consumption, energy consumption, and CO2 emission. The index was a good indicative of input resources consumption and output production as it varied inversely with water and energy consumption and CO2 emission and proportionally with yield. Since the high-water consumption was the main entry point for low index values in fields with flood irrigation, changing the irrigation to drip system or revisiting the irrigation scheduling and the estimated applied irrigation water amount were recommended. The index can be utilized to quantify the effectiveness of both recommendations and further new site-specific interventions and to assess their impact at scale. The index also recommended land use consolidation where farmers retain ownership of their lands but with cooperative farming."

Our novel review strategy allows us to report thematic analysis, co-citation analysis, research collaboration analysis, and methodological and topical contribution. As policymakers prioritize sustainable development, we allow them to understand different dynamics of academic institutions’ carbon footprint and report policy suggestions to improve it. As any change at higher research institutions has a wider impact on society in general, it is our opinion that developing sustainable university campuses also has implications for future research, management practices and compliance with sustainable development goals."

These smallholder dairy farms are often considered to emit substantial greenhouse gases (GHG) but are poor in productive performances. Therefore, it is crucial to estimate the carbon footprint (CF) of milk production of the smallholder Indian dairy farms. The primary objectives of the study were (1) Assessing the CF of milk production of smallholder dairy farms through life cycle analysis in south-interior Karnataka, India; (2) Identifying the hotspots of GHG emissions and significant factors influencing the CF of milk production in smallholder dairy production system. The study accounted GHG emissions from different sources and considered multiple functions of the smallholder production system. Estimations were made based on primary data collected from 47 farms and associated secondary data. For estimating the CF of milk production, the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) on a CO2-equivalent (CO2-eq) basis from feed production, enteric fermentation, manure management, transport and energy usage were allocated to fat- and protein-corrected milk (FPCM) based on mass balance, price (crop byproducts and residues) and feed digestibility. Principal component analysis and stepwise linear regression analysis were performed to identify the major factors influencing the CF. The average total GHG emissions (kg CO2-eq yr−1 farm−1) attributable to milk production based on mass, economic, and digestibility allocations were 8,936, 8,641, and 8,759, respectively. The contributions of CH4, N2O, and CO2 to the total farm GHG emission were 70.6%, 20.5%, and 7.69%, respectively. The major emission hotspots were CH4 emission from enteric fermentation (66.8%) and GHG emission from feed production (23.0%). The average CF of cradle-to-dairy cooperative milk production varied from 1.45 to 1.81 kg CO2-eq kg FPCM−1. The CF of milk production was more than 2-fold greater, when milk yield was below 3,500 kg lactating cow−1 yr−1. The FPCM yield 100 kg body weight−1, dry matter intake, and CH4 emission from manure management were the strongest determinants of the CF and explained 83.4% of the observed variation. The study emphasized the importance of considering multiple functions of a mixed crop-livestock-based dairy production system for estimating CF per unit of product. The results suggest that maintaining high-yielding dairy animals and adopting appropriate feeding strategies for better feed utilization are the possible effective interventions for reducing the CF of milk production."

Based on the microscopic perspective of farmers, this research uses the data from the Fixed Observation Points of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs in China in 2009 to 2015 and examines the impact of farmland circulation on the carbon footprint of agricultural cultivation using the fixed-effect model. In addition, heterogeneity analysis is conducted. The results show that farmland circulation has an impact on the carbon footprint of agricultural cultivation. Specifically, the transferred farmland significantly reduces the carbon footprint while there are heterogeneities in the effect of farmland circulation on the carbon footprint of agricultural cultivation due to the different regions or the variable education levels of the head of households."

This has placed tremendous pressure on sustainable global development. Many countries and regions in the world have adopted intensive subsistence cultivation methods when planting maize; however, limited studies exist on these methods. The main purpose of this research is to show the impact of climate change on maize yields and carbon footprint (CF) in South Korea over 10 years, find the proper operating method and promote the advanced combination of inputs for the sustainable development of maize farmers. Design/methodology/approach This study used survey data from the South Korea Rural Development Administration of 2010, 2014 and 2019 to estimate the CF of maize planting under intensive subsistence cultivation. Life-cycle assessment was used to determine the CF. Farmers were grouped according to significant differences in yield and GHG emissions. Linear regression was used to measure the dependence of the main contributors on the CF production and carbon efficiency. Findings In South Korean maize planting, N in chemical fertiliser was the most significant contributor to the CF and organic fertiliser was the most significant input. The use of chemical and organic fertilisers significantly affects the production of the CF and carbon efficiency. Households in the high-yield and low-GHG emission groups are more sustainable because they generate the least GHG when producing and earning through maize cultivation. Globally, maize production in South Korea has a relatively low CF and maize production produces fewer GHG. Originality/value This study provides information for policymakers to determine key operational options for reducing GHG emissions using intensive subsistence cultivation of maize production in South Korea and other countries."

In light of this, breeding cattle resilient to changes in feeding regimens is increasingly becoming an important topic. Body reserves can play a crucial role when feed resources are limited. We simulated populations of dairy cows selected with 2 different breeding goals: one reflecting the current breeding goal and the other placing weight on minimum level of body reserves in early lactation and change in body reserves during lactation. We considered this latter as a breeding goal for resilience. We used the 2 dynamic simulation programs ADAM and AQAL to predict performance of the cows after selection. In AQAL, we modeled moderate and severe drought by decreasing feed quality and quantity offered to cows during one year. We compared cows selected with the 2 breeding goals under 3 environments: without disturbances related to climate and with moderate and severe drought. In the environments without disturbances and the moderate drought, the cows selected with the current breeding goal had higher lifetime lactation efficiency (energy invested in milk/energy acquired from feed) and lower carbon footprint per kilogram of protein in milk and meat than cows selected for resilience. However, with severe drought, cows selected for resilience had higher lifetime lactation efficiency and lower carbon footprint per kilogram of protein in milk and meat than those selected with the current breeding goal. This suggests that cows selected for high productive performance do not perform well under very limiting conditions, leading to increased climate impact. The importance of inclusion of body reserves as a resilience trait in dairy cattle breeding depends on the future environment in which the cows will be used."
1597,The Impact of Telemedicine in Reducing the Carbon Footprint in Health Care: A Systematic Review and Cumulative Analysis of 68 Million Clinical Consultations,Journal,Rodler; Severin; Ramacciotti; Lorenzo Storino; Maas; Marissa; Mokhtar; Daniel; Hershenhouse; Jacob; De Castro Abreu; Andre Luis; Fuchs; Gerhard; Stief; Christian G.; Gill; Inderbir S.; Cacciamani; Giovanni E.,European Urology Focus,9.0,2023,873,887,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euf.2023.11.013,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405456923002729,24054569,Sciencedirect,Carbon footprint; Telemedicine; Sustainability; Health care; Telehealth; CO; Green health care,"Context Carbon footprint (CF) has emerged as an important factor when assessing health care interventions. Objective To investigate the reduction in CF for patients utilizing telemedicine. Evidence acquisition The PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were queried for studies describing telemedicine consultation and reporting on carbon emissions saved and the carbon emissions of telemedicine devices as primary outcomes, and travel distance and time and cost savings and safety as secondary outcomes. Outcomes were tabulated and calculated per consultation. Carbon emissions and travel distances were also calculated for each total study cohort. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale, and the Oxford level of evidence was determined. Evidence synthesis A total of 48 studies met the inclusion criteria, covering 68 465 481 telemedicine consultations and savings of 691 825 tons of CO2 emissions and 3 318 464 047 km of travel distance. Carbon assessment was mostly reported as the estimated distance saved using a conversion factor. Medical specialties used telemedicine to connect specialists with patients at home (n = 25) or at a local center (n = 6). Surgical specialties used telemedicine for virtual preoperative assessment (n = 9), follow-up (n = 4), and general consultation (n = 4). The savings per consultation were 21.9–632.17 min and $1.85–$325. More studies focused on the COVID-19 time frame (n = 33) than before the pandemic (n = 15). The studies are limited by calculations, mostly for the travel distance for carbon savings, and appropriate follow-up to analyze the real impact on travel and appointments. Conclusions Telemedicine reduces the CF of the health care sector. Expanding the use of telemedicine and educating providers and patients could further decrease CO2 emissions and save both money and time. Patient summary We reviewed 48 studies on the use of telemedicine. We found that people used their cars less and saved time and money, as well as CO2 emissions, if they used teleconsultations. Some studies only looked at how much CO2 from driving was saved, so there might be more to learn about the benefits of teleconsultations. The use of online doctor appointments is not only good for our planet but also helps patients in saving time and money. This review is registered on the PROSPERO database for systematic reviews (CRD42023456839)."

Battery electric vehicles (BEVs), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are a few currently available examples of vehicle electrification. EVs have zero in-use emissions, however, depending on the region to be operated, well-to-wheel (WTW) emissions need to be considered for a realistic carbon footprint effect considering global warming (GW) analysis. Especially, considering the countries where the usage of renewable energy (RE) sources is extremely limited, such as Kuwait and other GCC countries, the benefit of EVs significantly decreases. Within this perspective in this study, an inclusive CO2 emissions analysis for two passenger segment vehicles with different prime movers are analyzed: ICE and electric motor (EM). Longitudinal vehicle models were developed via MATLAB/Simulink software for both prime mover configurations which are capable of simulating the fuel/energy consumption using Toyota Camry and Lexus UX 300e vehicles. The generated CO2 emissions by the two prime movers were compared using the previously generated Kuwait driving cycle (Kuwait DC). The results indicated that the use of BEVs generated fewer CO2 emissions nearly half the amount of what ICE propelled vehicles generated."

Irrigated agriculture increases food security yet has controversial implications for global climate change. Most previous studies have calculated carbon emissions and their composition in irrigated areas using the engineering approach to life-cycle assessment. By combining life cycle assessment (LCA)-based carbon emissions accounting with econometric models such as multiple linear regression and structural equation modeling (SEM), we conducted an interdisciplinary study to identify the influencing factors and internal mechanisms of the carbon footprint (CFP) of smallholder crop cultivation on irrigation reform pilot areas. To this end, we investigated corn and potato production data in the 2019–2020 crop years for 852 plots of 345 rural households in six villages (two irrigation agriculture pilot villages and four surrounding villages as controls) in Southwest China. The crop CFP in the irrigation agriculture pilot areas was significantly lower than in non-reform areas. Irrigation reforms mainly impacted the crop CFP through four intermediary effects: the project (implementation of field irrigation channels), technology (improving adoption of new irrigation technologies), management (proper irrigation operation and maintenance), and yield effects. All effects inhibited the CFP, except for the project effect that promotes carbon emissions. Among them, yield increase has the greatest impact on reducing CFP, followed by management and technology effects. Furthermore, planting practices, individual characteristics, and plot quality significantly impacted the crop CFP. This study has policy implications for understanding the food security–climate nexus in the food production industry."

An efficient logistics network is necessary link to support EPW recycling. This study, therefore, designed a circular symbiosis network for EPW recycling based on urban symbiosis strategy. The treatment of EPW in this network includes reuse, recycling and replacing. An optimization model with multi-depot collaboration combining material flow analysis and optimization methods was developed and a hybrid non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) was designed as technical support for designing the circular symbiosis network while quantitatively assessing the economic and environmental benefits of the network. The results show that the designed circular symbiosis option has better resource saving and carbon footprint reduction potential than both the business as usual option and circular symbiosis option without service collaboration. In practice, the proposed circular symbiosis network can save EPW recycling costs and reduce carbon footprint. This study provides a practical guideline for the application of urban symbiosis strategies to help urban green governance and the sustainable development of express companies."

To improve the recycling of concrete debris, a powder compaction process for concrete waste was designed to obtain recycled compacted concrete (hereinafter referred to as compact) and thermal treatment was proposed to be utilized to improve its strength. However, non-specific investigations of treatment parameters, like-treatment temperature, and duration, do still exist, and the required high production pressure (100 MPa) is impracticable. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of two novel treatments on compact in improving its strength and reducing its carbon footprint. First, the heat treatment process used in a previous study [1] was expanded by varying immersion durations and treatment temperatures. Second, autoclaving was employed to obtain a stronger compact with different treatment settings. Additionally, in both treatment processes, the efficacy of low production pressure (<100 MPa) was evaluated. For this, eighteen different concrete wastes, having different industrial wastes, like-fly ash, slag, were collected, crushed, and powdered to produce compacts. The treated compacts were characterized based on both compressive strength and carbon footprint to compare the environmental performance of a compact prepared via thermal treatments in the production phase. The test results revealed that increasing water immersion duration (to 48 h) during the heat treatment process improved the compact strength to up to 48 MPa, and autoclaving at higher temperatures (at 220 °C) resulted in a compact strength of up to 98 MPa. Additionally, a strength of 30 MPa was attained even at a low production pressure (10 MPa) after autoclaving. The estimated CO2 emissions of the compact production process developed in this study were as low as 70.6 kg/m3 of compact. At the present stage of the study, it can be deduced that the compact manufactured possesses potential for implementation in various non-structural applications, including the production of pavement blocks and bricks, with lower CO2 emissions."

This paper uses the Time-Varying Parameter Vector AutoRegression (TVP-VAR) model to explore the dynamic relationship between oil price, green bond index, carbon emission trading price and carbon efficiency index. The time-varying impulse response analysis results show that the oil price has a negative effect on the green bond index and carbon price and a positive impact on the carbon efficiency index in the short and medium term. The green bond index has a positive impact on the carbon price in the short and medium term, and a negative impact on the carbon efficiency index. In addition, carbon price shocks have a positive impact on the carbon efficiency index in the short and medium term. The robustness test indicates that our results are robust. These findings can help formulate relevant policies and prevent financial risks under the influence of energy prices."

Decoupling the growing imbalance from economic growth needs a stringent and coordinated package of sustainable policies. Previously, enhancing efficiency and vegetation carbon sequestration were dominant drivers to decouple. However, the role and magnitude of restructurings in the energy sector and economy in decoupling were underestimated. In this context, China’s 30 provinces were selected as study areas. By employing a carbon footprint pressure (CFP) indicator to represent the imbalance, a widely decoupling method was adopted to describe the decoupling state and trend of CFP and economic growth. An extended IPAT equation and the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index method were further used to reveal the role and magnitude of drivers on decoupling. The findings revealed that the CFP climbed significantly in 26 provinces between 2006 and 2015. We discovered that 22 provinces were working toward absolute decoupling, with 15 provinces achieving it during the 12-th Five-Year Plan. Our analysis revealed that improving energy efficiency was the primary driver of absolute decoupling, while substituting natural gas and oil for coal, reducing industry share, and enhancing carbon sequestration accelerated absolute decoupling. Considering the limited future role of improving energy efficiency and vegetation carbon sequestration, there is an urgent need to optimize and upgrade the structures of the energy sector and economy to mitigate the future climate risk."

As a result, industries have been forced to consider investing significantly in supply chains to achieve an efficient distribution of LNG for cost efficiency and carbon footprint reduction. To minimize the contribution of LNG maritime transportation to global climate change, there is a need to quantify the carbon footprints systematically. In this research, we developed a novel and practical model for estimating the carbon footprint for LNG maritime transport. Using the MATLAB program, an uncertainty-based carbon footprint accounting framework is created. The Monte Carlo simulation model is built to conduct a carbon footprint analysis while the main input parameters were changed within a reliable range. Later, a multivariate sensitivity analysis is performed using the Risk Solver software to estimate the most significant parameters on the net carbon footprints. The sensitivity analysis results showed that that steam process day and steaming fuel consumption are found to be the most sensitive parameters for the overall carbon footprint for both Laden and Ballast trips. Furthermore, it was found that the Q-Max vessel produces more carbon emissions when compared to the Q-Flex, although both are traveling the same distance and are using the same fuel type. The type of fuel is also significantly affecting the emission values due to the relevant carbon content in the fuel. Like the case of the two conventional vessels, the one that is running with the only LNG is found to have fewer emissions when compared to the one run with dual-mode."

Therefore, this study utilizes data from 27 OECD countries from 1992 to 2020 to investigate the complex relationships among renewable energy consumption (RE), environmental regulations (ER), financial efficiency (FE), and trade-adjusted carbon emissions (CCE). Additionally, we examine the moderating role of FE in the relationship between RE and CCE. This study employs the method of moment quantile regression to demonstrate that an increase in RE and more strict ER substantially reduces CCE. Similarly, FE has a significant inverse effect on environmental degradation. Further, we observe that as RE increases, FE plays a crucial moderating role, reinforcing the inverse relationship with CCE. In the context of the COP28 summit, this study recommends that policymakers integrate renewable energy strategies with financial restructuring to facilitate sustainable economic growth amidst climate change."

Quantitative estimates of the carbon footprint of urban ecosystems are crucial for developing low-carbon development policies to mitigate climate change. Herein, we reviewed more than 195 urban carbon footprint and carbon footprint related studies, collated the recent progress in carbon footprint calculation methods and research applications of the urban ecosystem carbon footprint, analyzed the research applications of the carbon footprint of different cities, and focused on the need to study the urban ecosystem carbon footprint from a holistic perspective. Specifically, we aimed to: (i) compare the strengths and weaknesses of five existing carbon footprint calculation methods [life cycle assessment, input–output analysis, hybrid life cycle assessment, carbon footprint calculator, and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)]; (ii) analyze the status of current research on the carbon footprint of different urban subregions based on different features; and (iii) highlight new methods and areas of research on the carbon footprint of future urban ecosystems. Not all carbon footprint accounting methods are applicable to the carbon footprint determination of urban ecosystems; although the IPCC method is more widely used than the others, the hybrid life cycle assessment method is more accurate. With the emergence of new science and technology, quantitative methods to calculate the carbon footprint of urban ecosystems have evolved, becoming more accurate. Further development of new technologies, such as big data and artificial intelligence, to assess the carbon footprint of urban ecosystems is anticipated to help address the emerging challenges in urban ecosystem research effectively to achieve carbon neutrality and urban sustainability under global change. Les écosystèmes urbains sont des systèmes complexes présentant des caractéristiques anthropiques qui génèrent des émissions considérables de CO2 contribuant aux changements climatiques mondiaux. Les estimations quantitatives de l’empreinte carbone des écosystèmes urbains sont cruciales pour l’élaboration de politiques de développement à faible émission de carbone visant à atténuer les changements climatiques. Dans cet article, les auteurs ont passé en revue plus de 195 études sur l’empreinte carbone urbaine et reliées à l’empreinte carbone urbaine, colligé les progrès récents en matière de méthodes de calcul de l’empreinte carbone et les applications de la recherche sur l’empreinte carbone des écosystèmes urbains, analysé les applications de recherche de l’empreinte carbone de différentes villes et mis l’accent sur la nécessité d’étudier l’empreinte carbone des écosystèmes urbains d’un point de vue holistique. Plus précisément, ils ont cherché à : (i) comparer les forces et les faiblesses de cinq méthodes existantes de calcul de l’empreinte carbone [évaluation du cycle de vie, analyse entrée-sortie, évaluation hybride du cycle de vie, calculateur de l’empreinte carbone et celle du Groupe d’experts intergouvernemental sur l’évolution du climat (GIEC)]; (ii) analyser l’état de la recherche actuelle sur l’empreinte carbone de différentes sous-régions urbaines en fonction de différentes caractéristiques; et (iii) mettre en lumière de nouvelles méthodes et de nouveaux domaines de recherche sur l’empreinte carbone des futurs écosystèmes urbains. Toutes les méthodes de comptabilisation de l’empreinte carbone ne sont pas applicables à la détermination de l’empreinte carbone des écosystèmes urbains; bien que la méthode du GIEC soit plus largement utilisée que les autres, la méthode hybride d’évaluation du cycle de vie est plus précise. Avec les avancées de la science et l’émergence de nouvelles technologies, les méthodes quantitatives de calcul de l’empreinte carbone des écosystèmes urbains ont évolué et sont devenues plus précises. Le développement ultérieur de nouvelles technologies, telles que celles qui utilisent les données massives et l’intelligence artificielle, pour évaluer l’empreinte carbone des écosystèmes urbains devrait aider à relever efficacement les nouveaux défis de la recherche sur les écosystèmes urbains afin d’atteindre la neutralité carbone et la durabilité urbaine dans le contexte des changements climatiques mondiaux.

Several studies indicated that feed additives such as 3-nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP) and nitrate have great potential to reduce enteric emissions. The objective of this study was to determine the net effects of 3-NOP and nitrate on farmgate milk carbon footprint across various regions of the United States and to determine the variability of carbon footprint. A cradle-to-farmgate life cycle assessment was performed to determine regional and national carbon footprint to produce 1 kg of fat- and protein-corrected milk (FPCM). Records from 1,355 farms across 37 states included information on herd structure, milk production and composition, cattle diets, manure management, and farm energy. Enteric CH4, manure CH4, and nitrous oxide were calculated with either the widely used Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Tier 2 or region-specific equations available in the literature. Emissions were allocated between milk and meat using a biophysical allocation method. Impacts of nitrate and 3-NOP on baseline regional and national carbon footprint were accounted for using equations adjusted for dry matter intake and neutral detergent fiber. Uncertainty analysis of carbon footprint was performed using Monte Carlo simulations to capture variability due to inputs data. Overall, the milk carbon footprint for the baseline, nitrate, and 3-NOP scenarios were 1.14, 1.09 (4.8% reduction), and 1.01 (12% reduction) kg of CO2-equivalents (CO2-eq)/kg of FPCM across US regions. The greatest carbon footprint for the baseline scenario was in the Southeast (1.26 kg of CO2-eq/kg of FPCM) and lowest for the West region (1.02 kg of CO2-eq/kg of FPCM). Enteric CH4 reductions were 12.4 and 31.0% for the nitrate and 3-NOP scenarios, respectively. The uncertainty analysis showed that carbon footprint values ranged widely (0.88–1.52 and 0.56–1.84 kg of CO2-eq/kg of FPCM within 1 and 2 standard deviations, respectively), suggesting the importance of site-specific estimates of carbon footprint. Considering that 101 billion kilograms of milk was produced by the US dairy industry in 2020, the potential net reductions of GHG from the baseline 117 billion kilograms of CO2-eq were 5.6 and 13.9 billion kilograms of CO2-eq for the nitrate and 3-NOP scenarios, respectively."

CO2 levels are rising steadily, and while countries worldwide are actively moving toward the sustainability goals proposed during the Paris Agreement in 2015, we are still a long way to go from achieving a sustainable mode of global operation. The increased popularity of cryptocurrencies since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009 has been accompanied by an increasing trend in greenhouse gas emissions and high electrical energy consumption. Popular energy tracking studies (e.g., Digiconomist and the Cambridge Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index (CBECI)) have estimated energy consumption ranges from 29.96 ​TWh to 135.12 ​TWh and 26.41 ​TWh to 176.98 ​TWh, respectively for Bitcoin as of July 2021, which are equivalent to the energy consumption of countries such as Sweden and Thailand. The latest estimate by Digiconomist on carbon footprints shows a 64.18 MtCO2 emission by Bitcoin as of July 2021, close to the emissions by Greece and Oman. This review compiles estimates made by various studies from 2018 to 2021. We compare the energy consumption and carbon footprints of these cryptocurrencies with countries around the world and centralized transaction methods such as Visa. We identify the problems associated with cryptocurrencies and propose solutions that can help reduce their energy consumption and carbon footprints. Finally, we present case studies on cryptocurrency networks, namely, Ethereum 2.0 and Pi Network, with a discussion on how they can solve some of the challenges we have identified."

The current levels of consumption-based carbon footprints in all developed economies grossly exceed the sustainable level. Scientists have concluded that in addition to technological solutions, downscaling of consumption and far-reaching changes in lifestyles will be needed to achieve environmental sustainability. In this study, we provide a tangible real-world example that reveals the scale of the needed change from a perspective of a European welfare state citizen. Universal basic income (UBI) represents an income that is just enough to fulfil basic needs, such as food, shelter, and medication. In our case country, Finland, UBI is in practice at the same level as the income of the lowest income decile. The purpose of this study is to present and analyse the carbon footprints at a consumption level that corresponds to UBI. We compare the carbon footprints at this low-income level to average Finnish carbon footprints and discuss their sustainability in the light of global carbon budgets. We use an input-output approach based on the Finnish ENVIMAT model. The average carbon footprint at the UBI level is 4.8 tCO2-eq and it focuses on necessities. It’s significantly lower than the average carbon footprint in Finland, 9.4 tCO2-eq, but still far from the level compatible with the current climate change mitigation targets. The results emphasize how challenging it is to find true low-carbon solutions for living in affluent countries. Lifestyle changes and technological leaps need to be combined and fostered by legislation."

In this paper, we trace MNEs’ carbon footprints (CFs) to the upstream along global value chains (GVCs) and analyze the driving factors that lead to changes in MNEs’ CFs through hierarchical structural decomposition analysis. Our findings show that the distribution of MNEs’ CFs is highly consistent with the distribution of their GVC production networks, where these CFs are mainly concentrated in advanced economies, and emerging markets and developing economies only account for a small but gradually increasing share. Further, MNEs’ CFs are mainly attributed to medium high/high-tech manufacturing, especially in emerging markets and developing economies, where over one-half of these firms’ CFs are generated in computer, electronics and optical products and motor vehicle production. Finally, we analyze the different impacts of changes in the emissions of domestic-owned enterprises, foreign-invested enterprises in host countries and emissions generated abroad on MNEs’ CFs as well as the main driving factors leading to these changes in the US, Germany, China, India, Mexico and Singapore. Our findings provide support for MNEs’ whole global-value-chain emission control to realize global carbon neutrality and shed light on possible pathways for mitigating the domestic carbon emissions of economies that are deeply integrated into GVCs."

Greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) in the production of foods as well as irrigated water use, characterized by its relative scarcity at production locations, were matched to all foods in the recalls using previously developed databases. Impacts were summed to create carbon and water scarcity footprints for diets (n = 16,800) of adults aged >18 y. Diet quality was assessed using the Healthy Eating Index (HEI). Foods with the highest impact on GHGE and selected additional foods were substituted for calorically equivalent, less impactful items. Footprints were calculated before and after these hypothetical substitutions. Results The highest impact foods were all beef items, and 19.8% of individuals consumed them (n = 3320). After substitution of these items with poultry or pork, the mean carbon and water scarcity footprints among those with substitutions significantly decreased (P < 0.001) by 48.4 ± 0.6% and 29.9 ± 0.4%, respectively. Across the entire sample, these represented mean reductions of 9.6 ± 0.3% and 5.9 ± 0.2%, respectively. The mean HEI after substitutions was 3.6 ± 0.1% higher than before (P < 0.001). None of the selected additional foods had population impacts as large as the beef substitutions. Conclusions Simple substitutions can be made in individuals’ diets to substantially reduce their carbon and water scarcity footprints without sacrificing dietary quality. Such substitutions may be easier to promote than complex dietary patterns."

A systematic review,Journal,Purohit; Amy; Smith; James; Hibble; Arthur,Future Healthcare Journal,8.0,2021,e85,e91,https://doi.org/10.7861/fhj.2020-0080,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2514664524005915,25146645,Sciencedirect,telemedicine; sustainability; e-health; carbon footprint,"ABSTRACT In the rapidly progressing field of telemedicine, there is a multitude of evidence assessing the effectiveness and financial costs of telemedicine projects; however, there is very little assessing the environmental impact despite the increasing threat of the climate emergency. This report provides a systematic review of the evidence on the carbon footprint of telemedicine. The identified papers unanimously report that telemedicine does reduce the carbon footprint of healthcare, primarily by reduction in transport-associated emissions. The carbon footprint savings range between 0.70–372 kg CO2e per consultation. However, these values are highly context specific. The carbon emissions produced from the use of the telemedicine systems themselves were found to be very low in comparison to emissions saved from travel reductions. This could have wide implications in reducing the carbon footprint of healthcare services globally. In order for telemedicine services to be successfully implemented, further research is necessary to determine context-specific considerations and potential rebound effects."
