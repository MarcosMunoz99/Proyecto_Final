AB  - CONTEXT
Agriculture is not only the basic guarantee for human survival, but also the basis for the economy development and ecology construction. Water use and carbon emissions in grain production will largely determine China's transition to “green”.
OBJECTIVE
On the basis of finding out how much water is consumed and how much carbon is emitted by grain cultivation, and then finding out whether and what extent water use and carbon emissions affect economic-ecological development in China.
METHODS
This study uses the Tapio decoupling model to calculate the decoupling status of the grain water‑carbon footprint and economic-ecological development in mainland China from 1998 to 2020. Then the Logarithmic Mean Division Index (LMDI) model is used to analyze the drivers of the change of water-economy decoupling status.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The results show that the grain water‑carbon footprint is well decoupled from economic development, most decoupling states are absolute decoupling (−3<e<0) and relative decoupling ① (0<e<1). The grain water‑carbon footprint decoupled from ecological development is weak, and the decoupling coefficient has significant spatio-temporal differences. The agricultural production technology is the main positive driver for the decoupling between grain water footprint and economic development in mainland China (−1<eB<0). And the economic development scale is the main restraining factor for the decoupling between grain water footprint and economic development (0<eC<1). All provinces in mainland China need to correctly handle the relationship between economy-ecology development and grain security, and take water conservation and carbon emission reduction as an important starting point for adjusting the industrial structure, so as to achieve “green” development.
SIGNIFICANCE
The grain water‑carbon footprint was calculated in an integrated manner, and then based on the calculation of the decoupling situation, the drivers of the decoupling situation were further assessed.

AB  - Agriculture is the second largest contributor (20 %) to total anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the world. There is a need to identify energy and carbon efficient cropping systems that reduce GHG emission and improve environmental quality. Using life cycle assessment (LCA), we evaluated the four cropping systems namely fallow – chickpea (F–C); Sesbania – mustard (Ses–M); blackgram – chickpea (B–C); sorghum + cowpea – mustard (S + C–M) cultivated during the 2018–2022 period. The energy use pattern and the input-output relationship were analysed. Three measures were utilized to quantify carbon footprints: CFa, which denotes emissions per unit area; CFb, indicating emissions per kilogram of yield; and CFe, representing emissions per unit of economic output. The result indicates that non-renewable sources of energy (diesel and fertilizer) contributed more than ∼80 % of the total energy consumed in the different cropping systems. The total energy requirement was the highest for S + C–M (16,972 MJ ha–1), followed by Ses–M (14,365 MJ ha–1), B–C (11,132 MJ ha–1) and F–C (8679 MJ ha–1) cropping systems. The S + C–M cropping system also had the highest energy use efficiency (9.13) followed by F–C (6.03), B–C (5.41) and Ses–M (5.41). The fallow–chickpea cropping system had the lowest values of CFa, CFb, and CFe however, the highest carbon efficiency (10.7) and the carbon sustainability index (9.7) were computed in S + C–M cropping system. Our findings indicate that thoughtfully structured, varied crop systems that integrate legumes and forage crops have the potential to significantly reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions, while sustaining or potentially improving overall productivity within these systems.

AB  - The increasing severity of global climate change has made reductions in carbon emissions an urgent global issue. The relative lack of carbon footprint analyses of urban public transportation systems (UPTS) is therefore surprising, given that UPTS is an important component of urban transportation and one that may play a crucial role in carbon emission reduction. This study conducts a spatio-temporal analysis of carbon footprints for UPTS during the COVID-19 pandemic based on smart card data in Beijing. Since the core of carbon footprint calculation is to estimate travellers' trip trajectories and the ridership of urban rail transit (URT) and buses, we construct a novel multi-layer urban rail network model to calculate passenger volume and travellers' trajectories through a traffic assignment model. Furthermore, we utilize the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to analyse the correlation relationship between the carbon footprints of buses and URT. Additionally, we conduct statistical analysis of the carbon footprint of UPTS. The results of the spatio-temporal analysis of carbon footprints for UPTS show significantly lower carbon emissions during holidays compared to those on working days, and emissions during peak hours contribute approximately half of the total daily UPTS emissions, while there are notable variations in the distribution of the carbon footprint among different districts. Moreover, our analysis reveals a positive correlation between the carbon footprints of buses and URT. The statistical analysis reflects different patterns of carbon footprint distribution on different dates during the pandemic, but the carbon footprint distributions on selected dates all follow a power-law distribution. This study may facilitate the understanding to the impacts of UPTS on the environment during the COVID-19 pandemic, and also provide important guidance and reference for the development of carbon emission reduction strategies.

AB  - This study empirically examines the impact of Electric Vehicles (EVs) and clean energy adoption on carbon footprints. With growing concerns over climate change and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the transition to electric vehicles and clean energy sources has gained significant attention as potential solutions. This research investigates the relationship between the adoption of EVs and clean energy technologies and their subsequent effect on carbon footprints. The study applied the Generalised Method Moments (GMM) on the data sourced from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the World Development Indicators (WDI) for the period 2011–2021 covering 27 countries. The findings reveal a strong correlation between the adoption of EVs and reductions in carbon footprints. It shows that a 1 % increase in renewable electricity output would result in a 0.5 % decline in carbon footprints. This implies that, as EV sales increase, the overall carbon emissions from the transportation sector decrease, primarily due to the lower emissions associated with electric vehicles compared to conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. Additionally, the study finds that the integration of clean energy sources into the electricity grid further contributes to carbon footprint reductions. The use of renewable energy in charging EVs minimizes the indirect emissions associated with electricity generation. The research concludes that the widespread adoption of EVs and clean energy sources has the potential to significantly reduce carbon footprints and mitigate the impact of climate change. However, it emphasizes the importance of continued technological advancements, increased availability of charging infrastructure, and supportive government policies to accelerate the transition towards a low-carbon transportation and energy system. Therefore, the study highlights the need for collaborative efforts among governments, industry stakeholders, and individuals to foster sustainable practices and achieve a more environmentally friendly future.

AB  - Offshore wind farms are fast-spreading off the southeast coast of China to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. However, unfavorable weather conditions in Southeast China (e.g. frequent typhoons and severe wind intermittency) may increase the carbon footprint of offshore wind energy. But typhoons have never been considered in carbon accounting before, which may affect the design decisions of stakeholders and research priority setting for academicians. (i) To determine the effect of typhoons on carbon footprint, a life cycle assessment was performed on a typical offshore wind farm using real data. The results demonstrate that typhoons can be the largest contributor to carbon footprint, and the maximum wind speed of typhoons is the most critical parameter to carbon footprint. (ii) To quantify the carbon emissions caused by typhoons, simplified models estimating carbon emission intensity under different maximum wind speeds of typhoons are established, using Monte Carlo method based on 51 historical typhoons. The models imply that wind turbines with Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) are highly recommended in typhoon-prone area, because their carbon footprint is smaller than those with Doubly-Fed Induction Generator (DFIG). (iii) To set carbon benchmarks for typhoons, statistic analysis was conducted based on the simulated samples generated by Monte Carlo method. The carbon benchmarks of typhoons show that gearbox has the highest carbon emission intensity (mean=4.35g/kW, 95th percentile=7.00g/kW) among all components, resulting DFIG with gearbox not suitable in typhoon-areas. The site selection of offshore wind farms in Southeast China should avoid areas where the maximum wind speed of typhoons exceeds 44.5 m/s. This study emphasizes the importance of typhoons in carbon footprint accounting for offshore wind farms in Southeast China. More significantly, the proposed simplified models and carbon benchmarks of typhoons can be applied to feasibility studies in early design stage for engineers and stakeholders.

AB  - To mitigate climate change, individual greenhouse gas emissions need to decline substantially. This paper empirically explores the relationship between individual carbon footprints and carbon literacy as well as socio-economic and attitudinal factors. To operationalize carbon literacy, we distinguish between carbon knowledge and carbon engagement. Our econometric analysis uses widely representative survey data for 1000 individuals in Germany and distinguishes between components of an aggregate carbon footprint and of carbon footprints related with electricity consumption, heating, motorized individual transport, aviation, and dietary choices. We find a negative and sizeable correlation between carbon engagement and the aggregate footprint, as well as the footprints related to electricity consumption and diet. For example, a one-unit increase in our index reflecting carbon engagement corresponds to a decrease in the aggregate carbon footprint of about 4%. Furthermore, for carbon knowledge we find a negative correlation with the carbon footprint from diet. We also find significant correlations between the carbon footprints and gender, age, income, education, environmental preferences, and policy orientation, which generally exhibit the intuitively expected signs, but differ somewhat across activities. Overall, our findings support the notion that fostering carbon engagement represents a more effective strategy for reducing individuals' carbon footprints than enhancing carbon knowledge.

AB  - In large oil and gas producing countries, extraction and processing activities, including upstream activities, can represent a large share of domestic emissions. As oil fields approach their expected service life and reach depletion, energy use and GHG emissions increase per unit of produced oil, shifting operations away from their optimal point. Thus, it is paramount that oil field life extension decisions account for energy use and GHG emissions. However, many facilities are having their service life extended without considering this energy inefficiency and previous life extension decision making studies have neglected GHG emissions. Addressing this issue, this paper proposes the inclusion of a carbon footprint assessment within the evaluation of oil and gas offshore production facility life extension. The carbon footprint assessment adds an environmental lens to the evaluation of ageing, formerly evaluated according to material degradation, obsolescence and organizational issues. An eleven-stage framework is proposed to systematize the ageing related carbon footprint assessment and support life extension decision-making: (1) Objective definition, (2) Scope definition, (3) Field conditions description, (4) Scope breakdown into manageable portions, (5) Detailed data collection for each process and subsystem, (6) Input and output definition for each process and subsystem, (7) Process modelling, (8) Methodology definition for energy demand and inefficiency estimate, (9) Monitoring indicator definition, (10) Performance evaluation, and (11) Interpretation of results. The proposed framework is applied to a hypothetical case study, developed with data from a typical oil and gas offshore production platform operated in Brazil. Two LE improvement strategies were simulated, i.e. reducing the number of gas turbines, and increasing the export of natural gas. Both alter the modus operandi of the compression system and do not require additional equipment installation. These strategies resulted in a combined reduction of 922,000 tCO2 during the extended 10-year operation. This outcome demonstrates that by applying the framework opportunities for reducing energy use and GHG emissions during life extension can be identified and quantified, facilitating life extension decision-making.

AB  - Green finance is the beacon of hope in a world striving for sustainability, where financial growth and environmental responsibility go hand in hand. The BRICS, containing five emerging economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), recently announced Iran, Egypt, Argentina, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE as six potential new members. This expansion offers promising prospects for advancing environmental sustainability through green finance, which can be an excellent tool. In this respect, this research examines how green finance affects the carbon footprint in BRICS+6 economies. Earlier studies used panel data techniques to probe the association between these variables but overlooked that certain countries still needed to possess such a link separately. Hence, this research adopts the Quantile-on-Quantile approach, which provides a holistic universal view and customized findings for each country. The outcomes display that green finance improves environmental quality by diminishing carbon footprint at distinct quantiles of data distribution.

The present study is made on bituminous concrete pavement with traffic up to 50 MSA and studying the critical factors affecting the pavement performance. The Minitab’s Response Surface Methodology − Box Behnken method was used for the Design of Experiments which includes critical factors and responses obtained from ANSYS finite element modeling of the inverted pavement. The critical factors and responses are normally distributed and indicate a linear relationship with the least error. The composite desirability for minimum stress and strains in the pavement layers was found to be 0.89. The optimized pavement thickness and layer material properties were validated with two pavement field cross sections of different Indian National Highways and it is observed that the optimized cross-section is safe. Further, this research paper carried out Life Cycle Cost Analysis and Life Cycle Assessment of inverted pavement with optimized pavement cross-section obtained including the carbon footprint during the vehicle operation phase. The study demonstrated the benefits of inverted pavement with reduced costs and carbon emissions. Thus, this approach paves the way towards sustainable and long-lasting pavements.

AB  - The whole life cycle of wool products is long and involves many inputs and outputs. There are many issues that need to be discussed and solved in the carbon footprint accounting of wool products. In this paper, key issues such as system boundary, calculation method, accounting data, and allocation method are analyzed and discussed to accurately account for the carbon footprint of wool products. The results show that when accounting for the partial carbon footprint of wool products, the system boundary endpoint of the “gate” is more operable. The model estimation method used to calculate the carbon footprint of sheep rumination needs further improvement in feed intake prediction and methane conversion coefficient. Clarifying the carbon sequestration and carbon transfer mechanism and accurately tracing the source of carbon elements in wool can quantify the carbon sequestration effect of wool products. The data should be prioritized in the order of site-specific data, primary data, and secondary data. The protein mass allocation method can better allocate wool and co-products in the raw material production stage. A full and systematic analysis of the key issues of the carbon footprint accounting for wool products can ensure the effectiveness and comparability of the carbon footprint accounting results and contribute to the green and low-carbon development of the wool industry.

AB  - Urban activities currently consume 75% of global final energy demand, which is expected to increase given absolute and relative population growth in cities. Assessments of both producer (upstream) and consumer (downstream) ecological and socioeconomic impacts of urban inter-industry exchanges are needed to reduce energy consumption and resource use behind the industrial footprints of cities. Environmental extensions in the input-output analysis are designed from the user side perspective, focusing only on commercial energy supply and use. This study introduced emergy-evaluated supply-extended and use-extended carbon footprint models for Vienna and compared their empirical and conceptual implications. Emergy-evaluated footprints of Vienna's urban consumption were estimated by combining industrial and systems ecology approaches as per the research question, based on previous investigations of GHG emissions and energy supply- and use-extensions. Results showed that the ranking of footprints of final product categories is sensitive to the evaluation method, with products of extractive and manufacturing industries differing by more than 10% depending on whether emergy or carbon evaluation is chosen. The emergy-based comparison further reveals that for products of extractive industries, the difference between use and supply extension results can be more than 20% as opposed to carbon-based comparison with the difference between supply and use extension results for services not even amounting to 5%. Future studies could address the over-estimation of direct energy supply to the economy, under-estimation of product and service, inconsistency in standard use-extension design, and challenges in assembling emergy-evaluated supply and use extensions. Fundings are relevant for unified responsibility assessment of upstream and downstream sectors without prioritising structural features.

AB  - Estimating the carbon footprint of products at the early stage of design is crucial for streamlining the engineering process of sustainable products. However, the carbon footprint estimation of the products requires material and manufacturing information that is typically not available at the early design stage. In this study, a novel method is proposed for carbon footprint estimation, which can evaluate the carbon footprint through the shape recognition of computer aided design (CAD) models based on the graph deep learning. The learning model utilizes the boundary representation of CAD models for deeper understandings of the CAD model shape. The proposed method trains the deep learning model on the existing CAD models to recognize important sub-shapes and attributes, including materials and manufacturing information, such as welded parts, which are the essential data for the carbon footprint estimation. The proposed method enables the designers to estimate the carbon footprint without the laborious condition setting, which facilitates concurrent monitoring and improvement of the carbon footprint. The method is applied to actual assembly models and demonstrated that the material and welded parts, which are attributes required for emission prediction, can be recognized with an accuracy of more than 80%.

AB  - This study investigates the environmental impact of cryptocurrency blockchain technology, specifically focusing on the adoption of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Utilizing instrumental regression analysis, it examines the consensus mechanisms—Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS)—and their association with carbon footprint. The findings reveal a clear correlation between the adoption of PoW-based cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and carbon emissions. Notably, PoW-based cryptocurrencies generate approximately 0.86 metric tons of carbon emissions per transaction, which is significantly higher than PoS-based transactions like Ethereum. Concerns also arise regarding the sustainability of Bitcoin mining after the fourth halving period and potential shortages in PoW-based mining resources. As mining rewards decrease, the challenge of timely block creation intensifies. By projecting future BTC mining phases, the study anticipates diminishing rewards in each halving period, potentially leaving around 2500 BTC units available for mining by 2120. This suggests that achieving the full 21 million BTC may prove practically unattainable within the current blockchain framework. Furthermore, the research highlights the speculative and risky nature of cryptocurrencies lacking regulatory oversight, which tends to attract irresponsible investors. It stresses the importance of developing a nuanced understanding of the environmental implications of PoW cryptocurrencies and advocating for responsible innovation. Additionally, the study underscores the necessity of considering the monetary policy implications and raising awareness among investors to ensure responsible decision-making.

AB  - Amidst the global urgency to address climate change, Taiwan stands at the forefront of implementing sustainable solutions, notably introducing carbon footprint labels on food products. This initiative aims to usher consumers towards more environmentally-conscious purchasing decisions by providing insights into the ecological impact of their food choices. Our comprehensive research explores a variety of determinants that sway Taiwanese consumers in their buying behaviors, specifically focusing on the influence of these carbon footprint labels. Surprisingly, while one might anticipate media exposure to be a dominant force in shaping opinions, our findings suggest its role remains relatively limited in this context. Instead, personal experiences with climate events and robust influences from family and peers emerge as the primary drivers in purchasing decisions. These direct interpersonal interactions, both in terms of shared experiences and word-of-mouth recommendations, offer profound insights into shaping consumer behavior. As Taiwan ambitiously targets net-zero emissions by 2050, harnessing the power of these social dynamics becomes imperative. Through strategic interventions that amplify these social channels of influence, there's potential to bolster the public's inclination towards sustainable consumption, ensuring the success of initiatives like carbon footprint labeling.

AB  - Fast development of farming practices in China is projected to result in additional carbon emissions and thus affect farmland ecosystems' environmental performance. Based on 454 farm surveys on the North and Northeast China Plain, the carbon footprint (CF) of two farmland ecosystems (irrigated system for wheat and maize on the North China Plain and rainfed system for maize on the Northeast Plain) were assessed and emission reduction pathways explored by quantifying greenhouse gas emissions of agricultural inputs and farm practices during the entire crop growing seasons with an agricultural footprint model. The results demonstrated that the GHG emissions from wheat and maize rotation in the irrigated system were 7.63 t CO2 eq ha−1 and 3.17 t CO2 eq ha−1 for single season maize in the rainfed system. While energy consumption accounted for 12.5%–21.3% of the carbon footprint in both systems, the group assessment found that the largest difference in GHG emissions between the high and low emission groups came from mechanical energy consumption. Approximately 50.6% and 39.2% of the mechanical carbon footprint of wheat and maize, respectively, were caused by irrigation practices in the irrigated system. Regarding the rainfed system, where 46.6% of mechanical carbon emissions were generated by maize tillage operations. In addition, scenario analysis indicated that the mechanical carbon footprint could be reduced to 56 kg CO2 eq t−1 for NCP-wheat and 26 kg CO2 eq t−1 for NCP-maize, respectively, by optimizing yields and irrigation practices in irrigated systems and that the mechanical carbon footprint of NEP-maize could be reduced to 25 kg CO2 eq t−1 by optimizing yields and tillage practices in rainfed systems. Therefore, improvement in mechanization in irrigation and tillage practices can contribute to reduce GHG emissions in China. Water-saving irrigation technology is recommended in irrigated area and conservation tillage is recommended in rainfed agricultural area to reduce carbon footprints.

AB  - Craft breweries may fall behind large brewing companies in reducing the carbon footprints of their value chains due to limited resources, financial constraints, and a lack of technical knowledge to fully understand their emissions. However, by increasing their awareness of the impact of their entire value chains, craft breweries can accelerate the decarbonisation of the industry by creating competition among breweries to appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. This work developed a freely available carbon calculator (10.6084/m9.figshare.22758692) using transparent, open-source data which may be used for benchmarking and identifying opportunities for emission reductions in UK craft breweries as well as providing a reference point for future carbon footprint analyses of global brewing value chains. The carbon footprint for craft brewing was calculated for a wide range of packaging types across three realistic scenarios (low, medium, and high carbon footprints) based on collected data and addresses the discrepancies between values reported in previous literature. Overall, the calculated carbon footprints ranged between 205 (20 L steel kegs, low carbon footprint scenario) and 1483 (single-use, 0.33 L glass bottles, high carbon footprint scenario) gCO2e per litre of beer. Novel hotspots (including wort boiling, the packaging process in a brewery, and the contribution of secondary and tertiary packaging) were identified. The overwhelming contribution of Scope 3 emissions (contributing between 57 and 95 % of the total carbon footprint) further emphasised the need to provide increased knowledge to craft breweries.

AB  - This research is devoted to the analysis of tourists’ preferences for climate change (CC) mitigation policies in the Mallorca region. The stated choice experiment, used for evaluation, was designed combining a set of alternatives, characterised by carbon footprint reduction and offset policies, taking into account the existence of environmental direct benefits, but also indirect benefits that improve tourist experience or co-benefits derived from the location of policy projects. Economic welfare in form of willingness to pay (WTP) was estimated, and the alternatives were compared using compensating variation values. The study's findings validate the prevailing preference for carbon reduction policies over offsetting measures, except when the first don't have co-benefits and the latter are implemented locally. In the latter case, there is no significant difference in WTP between reducing the carbon footprint and locally offsetting it. Results not only contributes to the ongoing economic debate surrounding CC mitigation policies but also provides key information for designing mitigation schemes in diffuse emission sectors such as tourism.

AB  - Digitalization is a primary driver of sustainable development. We investigate the impact of digitalization on the carbon footprints of the (national) government sector, households, enterprises, non-governmental organizations, and imported carbon footprints. We use panel data analysis to study the link between digitalization and sustainable economic growth by monitoring digital carbon footprint patterns. Our study results show that digitalization has a positive and statistically significant impact on sustainability development measured by the sustainable development goals (SDG). Furthermore, our results support the hypothesis that advancing total factor productivity, referring to green total factor productivity, is critical for meeting SDGs. Notably, we determine that the ecological footprint across sectors and countries is diverging, or at best, slowly converging at a pace that is not even close to that required to meet the 2030 SDGs. Therefore, policymakers and practitioners must strategically revise sustainability policies to ensure industrial and economic transition and adaptability to climate change and advance economic green growth and sustainable development.

AB  - Interest on the potential CO2 sequestration of marine bivalve aquaculture has increased during the last decade. However, there is still some controversy about which biological processes are involved and how to estimate their contribution to the carbon footprint of bivalve aquaculture. This work considers the dissolved inorganic carbon, CO2 and alkalinity fluxes linked to flesh and shell growth, calcification, respiration, faeces egestion, and ammonia excretion, accounting also for the RDOC production associated to these processes. We have developed an algorithm for a dynamic estimation of these fluxes based on a net production DEB growth model for mussels. The resulting model has been implemented in Python to create a toolbox with a graphical user interface. This toolbox allows the selection of different culture strategies, in terms of seeding date, seed size and culture length, and consequently analyzes the carbon footprint and impact on the carbonate chemistry of seawater of aquaculture management.

AB  - The distribution of the footprint within a country is regularly computed using consumption data, and with the assumption that the footprint from a product category is proportional to the spending on that product. Here, we explore the limitations of this proportionality assumption. We provide a systematic framework for discussing the gap between the true carbon footprint and the carbon footprint imputed with spending, a framework which is valid for any type of footprint. We show that two channels can bias the distribution of the carbon footprint: the heterogeneity in prices paid and the heterogeneity in the carbon intensity of products purchased. We rely on French household budget survey data to illustrate how these channels operate and interplay, and use cooking oils as a case study of the interplay of the two channels. We find that wealthier households pay higher prices. Because of the price heterogeneity, the carbon footprint tends to be overestimated for top income and underestimated at the bottom. We also use consumption of cooking oils as a more-in depth case study of the carbon intensity heterogeneity. This case shows that it can lead to an outcome similar to price heterogeneity.

AB  - For a developing nation such as Malaysia with a significant reliance on fossil fuels for electricity, understanding the environmental consequences of this dependency is crucial. Thus, this study utilizes the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) method to explore the impact of electricity intensity (EINT), renewable energy in electricity generation (ERE), and gross domestic product (GDP) on Malaysia's environmental quality, from 1985 to 2020. By using carbon emissions (CO2 emissions) and ecological footprint (EF) as proxies, the study finds a significant long-run impact of these factors on environmental degradation. Notably, the study also observed an inverted U-shaped relationship between GDP and environmental degradation, validating the existence of Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. The findings also imply that while electricity intensity is associated with increased emissions, the use of renewable energy (RE) sources for electricity generation may contribute to emission reduction. But the results for both variables show reversal signs on EF. The study's adoption of the fully ordinary least square (FMOLS) method reinforces the same results, thus, justifying the cointegrating relationship between studied variables. Drawing from these outcomes, the study advocates for a comprehensive approach to renewable energy management, emphasizing both its utilization and waste in order to improve ecological footprint. Moreover, the pressing need to enact legislation on energy efficiency and conservation is crucial in ensuring decoupling and securing sustainable development in Malaysia.

AB  - Pruning is a major source of carbon emissions from urban trees. The high cost of evaluating pruning quantities by destructive measurements has limited the research on pruning. By combining terrestrial laser scanning and quantitative structure models, pruning quantities can be assessed non-destructively. This study focuses on the impact of pruning during tree production, as it is intense and has been rarely evaluated. Using Sophora japonica from a nursery in Beijing as an example, point cloud data were collected from 181 uneven-aged Sophora japonica for the simulation of pruning at a single tree level. All pruning stages were incorporated into the assessment of the carbon footprint of Sophora japonica production for 15-year-old trees. The results show that previous studies have underestimated the tree carbon footprints of pruning, leading to a severe underestimation of the carbon footprint of tree production. Crown reduction removes the most above-ground woody biomass during tree production, over half, while the decomposition of pruning waste is the most significant source of carbon emissions. The removal ratio from pruning of individual trees is consistent within the same pruning pattern. The tree volume can serve as a good predictor for estimating pruning quantities, but crown diameter sometimes needs to be considered. Implementing pruning interventions, harvesting in advance, and choosing appropriate methods for pruning waste disposal can reduce carbon emissions from pruning.

The time period considered for the research spans from 2009 to 2019. Utilizing the CS-ARDL methodology, the results indicate a correlation between reducing ecological footprint and bolstering private sector domestic credit. Additionally, a relationship between diminishing private sector domestic credit of banks and augmenting private sector domestic credit within the financial sector has been identified. In conjunction with other indicators of financial advancement, the significance of domestic lending to the private sector has been underscored. The study reveals a notable reduction in human population's adverse impact on the environment. However, increased levels of energy consumption, foreign direct investment and per capita GDP are associated with an improvement in global quality of life. Particularly noteworthy is the validation of the "pollution haven hypothesis" in the global economic context. The implications of this research are substantial; suggesting that global economic dynamics may support efforts towards environmental conservation. However, outcomes may vary across regions or countries, particularly regarding the emphasis placed by the financial sector on environmental preservation. This study comprehensively examines the complex nexus between economic progress and its ecological consequences, keeping in consideration factors such as financial growth, urbanization, energy consumption and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).

AB  - This study presents a novel methodology for repurposing dumped coal ash (DCA) from power plant landfills, aiming to reduce waste and lower carbon footprint of pavement base construction. Three DCAs were modified into two distinct particle groups through sieving: fine particles for cement replacement, evaluated against a ternary cementitious binder with fly ash (FA) and flue gas desulfurization gypsum (FG) using Response surface methodology (RSM), and coarse particles for aggregate treatment. The modified DCA mixes and conventional cement-treated base (CTB) mix were compared for environmental and economic benefits through cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment. The results indicate that replacing fine DCA optimized setting time and compressive strength based on its chemical composition, aligning with FA and FG in the RSM process. A 25 % cement replacement with fine DCA balanced the mechanical properties of the modified cement, while a 50 % replacement with coarse DCA effectively improved aggregate properties compared to natural crushed rock. Modified DCA enhanced pavement engineering properties, surpassing the strength and resilience benchmarks of CTB mix. Utilizing optimal modified DCA mixes could reduce carbon footprint and costs by approximately 40 % and 44 %, respectively. Hence, the outcomes highlight challenges and opportunities for modifying DCA for resource conservation and low-carbon transportation infrastructure.

AB  - The increasing inter-provincial trade is prompting the regional transmission of agricultural carbon footprint (ACF) in China. Understanding the factors driving this phenomenon is crucial for mitigating the carbon footprint of agricultural production. Nevertheless, comprehending the carbon flow of the agricultural industry within China remained insufficient. Furthermore, quantifying the driving forces behind ACF and carbon flow for a single year posed a significant challenge. In this study, we aim to uncover the distribution and flow pattern of the carbon footprint in China's agricultural industry using a multi-regional input-output model. Moreover, we introduce a novel approach by employing geographical detectors to analyze the influencing factors from a spatial heterogeneity perspective. The results reveal that China's ACF in 2015 amounted to 48,826.69 thousand tons of carbon equivalents (CO2eq). The ACF was generally higher in the northern regions and lower in the central areas. A Jevons paradox phenomenon was observed in Shandong, where ACF was higher, and agricultural carbon emission intensity was lower, suggesting that improvements in agricultural efficiency can paradoxically lead to increased carbon emissions. Notably, 39.39% of ACF was involved in regional transfers. The primary flow of agricultural carbon occurred from northern to southeastern coastal areas, with Guangdong (4447.49 thousand tons of CO2eq) and Heilongjiang (−2225.25 thousand tons of CO2eq) being the leading inflow and outflow provinces, respectively. Socioeconomic and agricultural factors played a significant role in shaping the distribution of ACF and its inter-regional transmission. Socioeconomic factors, including GDP, population, industry structure, and educational expenditure, predominantly influenced inflow ACF. Meanwhile, agricultural factors related to land use and grain output primarily affected outflow ACF. Suggestions for reducing carbon footprint in the agricultural sector was proposed based on the condition of ACF and flow types, from the production and consumption aspects. Provinces of ACF inflow and outflow should share the responsibility for reducing ACF, potentially through carbon trading and reciprocal technological assistance. This study offers substantial theoretical value by providing a comprehensive understanding of the spatial flow and driving factors of ACF within China's agricultural sector.

Rain garden is an exceptional Nature-based Solution for rainwater management. When applying them to renovate old communities, the carbon footprint should be considered. This study focused on renovating facilities in the Greater Bay Area and utilized the Energy Expert platform to calculate rain garden carbon footprint with the Life Cycle Assessment. The carbon reduction benefits during the operation were estimated. This study accounting the life cycle carbon footprint of the 5455 m2 rain garden was 1117.42 tCO2e. The carbon footprint contribution, from highest to lowest was the end-of-life phase, materials production phase, construction phase, use and maintenance phase. Regarding carbon emission inventory, waste soil landfill, fertilizer acquisition, and waste soil recycling ranked high. Transportation also accounted for a remarkable carbon emission. The rain garden showed great potential for climate change mitigation, with a total and net carbon reduction of 1927.41 and 809.99 tCO2e, respectively. To reduce the carbon footprint of the rain garden, we should focus on waste soil treatment and transportation. Recommendations included increasing waste soil recycling, in situ recycling and green transportation.

AB  - Reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to address climate change is a global consensus, and municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWWTPs) should lead the way in low-carbon sustainable development. However, achieving effluent discharge standards often requires considerable energy and chemical consumption during operation, resulting in significant carbon footprints. In this study, GHG emissions are systematically accounted for, and the driving factors of carbon footprint growth in China’s MWWTPs are explored. In 2020, a total of 41.9 million tons (Mt) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) were released by the sector, with nearly two-thirds being indirect emissions resulting from energy and material usage. The intensity of electricity, carbon source, and phosphorus removing agent consumption increasingly influence carbon footprint growth over time. Through statistical inference, benchmarks for electricity and chemical consumption intensity are established across all MWWTPs under various operational conditions, and the potential for mitigation through more efficient energy and material utilization is calculated. The results suggest that many MWWTPs offer significant opportunities for emission reduction. Consequently, empirical decarbonization measures, including intelligent device control, optimization of aeration equipment, energy recovery initiatives, and other enhancements to improve operational and carbon efficiency, are recommended.

AB  - The increasing metal demand driven by energy and digital transition has led to more complex mining operations. To allocate environmental impacts in cases of mining co-production, this study proposes a physical method based on the relative geological scarcity of elements, which provides the basis for an exergy cost allocation. It focuses on calculating the energy and carbon footprint of 51 metals, including 28 co-products, based on available databases. The analysis considers the fuel type, main production stages and the energy footprint of up to 25 chemicals. This study provides new insights into 39 infrequently studied metals. Results show that by using renewable electricity in production, 41 metals can reduce their carbon footprint by up to 50 %. However, key metals such as Fe or Li require additional decarbonization efforts beyond electricity. Only by decarbonizing metal production is possible a renewable infrastructure that can achieve the energy transition goals.

To our knowledge, there is no study in France on waste production by the surgical team during the operation in orthopedic surgery, in a global scope. Therefore, we performed an observational investigation aiming to: (1) quantify and characterize the weight of the wastes generated after a panel of orthopedic procedures, (2) calculate the CO2 footprint generated by these wastes and extrapolate the figure at the national scale.
Hypothesis
Waste production is highly variable according to the types of procedures and infectious clinical waste is still a predominant source of waste and CO2 emission.
Materials and methods
It is a comparative and prospective study in which a total of 14 procedures were selected as a representative panel: arthroplasties (hip, knee), spine fusions, arthroscopic procedures (shoulder, knee), nerve release, forefoot osteotomies, trauma procedures. The main outcome was the average total weight of waste for each of the fourteen categories (280 measurements: 140 times 2, at the end of each procedure), expressed in kilograms (kg), and the proportions of infectious clinical waste (ICW) and household wastes (HW), expressed in percentages. Ten measures were prospectively recorded for each type of procedure in a single teaching hospital from January to September 2022. The theoretical carbon footprint generated by the treatment of the wastes was estimated in kilograms of CO2 equivalent (KgEqCO2). The national extrapolation of the carbon footprint was performed by collecting the total number of procedures in France in 2021 using the VisuChir tool.
Results
A total of 937kg of waste were produced for the 140 procedures, amongst which 514kg of ICW (54.8%) and 423kg of HW (45.2%). The overall median waste weight was 5.9kg (Q1: 4.4, Q3: 8.1), ranging from 1.8kg to 18.3kg. The overall median waste weight for HW was 2.8kg (Q1: 2.5, Q3: 3.4), ranging from 1.8kg to 17.8kg. The overall median waste weight for ICW was 3.8kg (Q1: 2.7, Q3: 4.8), ranging from 0.8kg to 7.2kg. The knee surgeries were responsible for the heaviest waste weight; the least waste-productive procedures were the foot and the carpal tunnel release. The median proportions of ICW varied from 39% for the total knee replacements to 72% for the femoral nails. There was a significant inverse correlation between the total waste weight and the proportion of ICW: r=−0.47, p<10−4. The total median estimated carbon footprint was 4.3KgCO2Eq (Q1: 3.1, Q3: 5.8), ranging from 1.59KgCO2Eq (Q1: 1.5, Q3: 1.8) and 7.07KgCO2Eq (Q1: 6.7, Q3: 8.17). The total median estimated carbon footprint was 3.5KgCO2Eq for ICW (Q1: 2.5, Q3: 4.5) and 0.76KgCO2Eq (Q1: 0.54, Q3: 1.3) for HW. The national median estimated carbon footprint was 10.1 million KgEqCO2 in 2021 for orthopedic surgery.
Conclusion
Our study revealed that in most cases more than half of the wastes were ICW. The total estimated national carbon footprint for orthopedic procedures was 10 million kilograms. The reduction of the ICW constitutes a cornerstone, as they are responsible for more carbon emissions.

AB  - The global carbon budget to keep warming within 1.5° is being rapidly depleted, and demand-side measures are crucial to meet mitigation targets. Although the Nordic countries are regarded as having strong environmental policies, per capita consumption-based carbon footprints are high. The effect of climate concern and other pro-environmental attitudes on pro-environmental behaviour has been extensively studied, but the relationship between climate concern and consumption-based carbon footprints is largely unknown. Using responses from around 8000 Nordic participants of an online carbon footprint calculator survey, carbon footprints were investigated at different levels of climate concern, across consumption domains, and across the five Nordic countries. Although participants with high climate concern had carbon footprints between 1.5–2 tons lower than those with low concern, the overall footprints were well above the global average, and 2–3x higher than the level compatible with 1.5° warming.

AB  - Carbon taxes are key policies to achieve climate goals. Yet, they increase prices especially in the short term, and can affect households’ income depending on their carbon footprints. Cash transfer programs can be used to address adverse social impacts and protect the poorest. However, because carbon footprints, and the consequent tax impacts, may change over time it is important to understand how to design and adapt such cash transfer programs accordingly. As the existing studies focus on single years, we address the gap in the literature in two steps. First, we estimate changes in carbon footprints and their drivers over time; second, we simulate the effects of a carbon tax in combination with cash transfers on poverty and inequality for the years 2004, 2007 and 2011 in Peru. We combine a bottom-up household carbon footprint estimation, and multiple scenarios simulation. We show that, in a context of rapid economic growth, footprints increase over time, particularly for lower deciles. Most importantly, the distributional impacts of a reform combining carbon tax and cash transfers change by year. The paper concludes that, to maximize poverty and inequality reduction, the design of cash transfer programs and tax levels need to be adapted over time.

AB  - The energy consumption in Pakistan, both renewable and nonrenewable, is examined herein as an important factor in carbon emissions. Employing a nonlinear ARDL (auto-regressive distributed lag), the research examines data from 1980 to 2021. The results show that the use of renewable energy has a negligible effect when it comes to the nation's overall carbon emissions. This is mainly because the key pollutants in Pakistan's energy sector come from nonrenewable sources, such as coal and natural gas. However, the report observes that the carbon emissions within the nonrenewable energy sector are directly related to economic growth. A further theorem of the nonlinear analysis has brought the limited role of renewable energy in resolving environmental problems into sharper focus, perhaps due to its lower proportion of Pakistan's total energy mix. According to the study, improving the proportion of renewable energy is the only way to combat environmental problems.

AB  - Carbon footprint (CF) estimation has emerged as an integral tool for greenhouse gas (GHG) management, providing direction for emission reduction strategies and verification processes. Since capturing the full lifecycle emissions of goods and services at the city level can be methodologically challenging due to the fact that cities have multiple sources of emissions (e.g. transportation, waste, buildings), our study focused on evaluating the carbon footprint of various types of urban buildings across six sectors. This evaluation was conducted in one of the most rapidly urbanized cities in the Middle East, Doha City, Qatar, and was based on electricity consumption data from 2017 to 2020. Using multiregional input–output life cycle assessment (MRIO-LCA) and hot/coldspot analysis, this study identified CF emission spatiotemporal patterns and the major buildings responsible for the highest emissions. The results indicated that residential villas and the commercial sector had the highest electricity consumption and steady increases in CF emissions during the study period, whereas hotels had the lowest annual electricity consumption among all sectors. The study also identified significant CF emission hotspots from Doha residential buildings in the southwestern and northeastern areas. In contrast, the CF hotspots from commercial buildings were concentrated in the industrial area in the southern part of the city and in the West Bay area in the eastern part. Overall, the findings of this study provide important policy implications and a comprehensive assessment of dynamic changes in CF emissions from different building types.

AB  - Purpose
The National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom (UK) is aiming to be carbon net zero by 2040 to help limit the dangerous effects of climate change. Radiotherapy contributes to this with potential sources quantified here.
Method
Activity data for 42 patients from within the breast IMRT and prostate VMAT pathways were collected. Data for 20 prostate patients was also collected from 3 other centres to enable cross centre comparison. A process-based, bottom-up approach was used to calculate the carbon footprint. Additionally, patients were split into pre-COVID and COVID groups to assess the impact of protocol changes due to the pandemic.
Results
The calculated carbon footprint for prostate and breast pre-COVID were 148 kgCO2e and 101 kgCO2e respectively, and 226 kgCO2e and 75 kgCO2e respectively during COVID. The energy usage by the linac during treatment for a total course of radiotherapy for prostate treatments was 2–3 kWh and about 1 kWh for breast treatments. Patient travel made up the largest proportion (70–80%) of the calculated carbon footprint, with linac idle power second with ∼ 10% and PPE and SF6 leakage were both between 2 and 4%.
Conclusion
These initial findings highlight that the biggest contributor to the external beam radiotherapy carbon footprint was patient travel, which may motivate increased used of hypofractionation. Many assumptions and boundaries have been set on the data gathered, which limit the wider application of these results. However, they provide a useful foundation for future more comprehensive life cycle assessments.

AB  - This paper presents a multi-dimensional evaluation of decentralized production networks based on modular production plants. The main objective of this evaluation is to examine the effects of different degrees of decentralization in production networks of the chemical industry. Using the production of a biopolymer as an example, the study includes strategic supply chain planning by agent-based simulations, economic evaluation by calculation of net present values and environmental assessment by calculation of carbon footprints. By allowing for dynamic reconfiguration of the decentralized networks over time, it is shown that mobile, modular plant concepts are beneficial to reduce supply chain expenses. Transportation efforts resulting from strategic supply chain planning are reduced by 40 % with increasing degree of decentralization. The profitability of the decentralized networks is dominated by the costs for the production processes themselves as capital and operational expenditures allocate to >50 % of the total costs. Product prices of 3000 to 5500 €2020 per ton are necessary to reach profitability of the decentralized production networks. Regarding the environmental assessment, the carbon footprint of the supply chain accounts for <3 % of the total emissions, which are dominated by the provision of process heat that accounts for 46 to 68 % of the total emissions. Carbon footprint of the decentral production networks can be significantly reduced by a systematic electrification of 90 % of the process heat demand.

AB  - Cities, as the primary hubs of economic activities and the end-points of goods and services consumption, bear significant responsibility for the majority of global greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, there is a pressing need for more granular data at the subnational level to formulate effective and feasible measures in line with current decarbonization targets. In this study, we present the carbon footprint embodied in household consumption behavior of 11 major metropolitan areas in Japan. Furthermore, our study innovatively introduces a temporal perspective, employing time organization as an insightful indicator to delineate the disparities in carbon footprints that arise from varying carbon intensities of distinct activities. The results are given from the following three aspects: 1) structural comparison of urban household carbon footprints; 2) time-based activity differences and drivers; and 3) inequality analysis among different activity-based carbon footprints. Here, we found that eating contributes most substantially to the carbon footprint. Conversely, transportation activities manifest the greatest regional inequality in carbon footprints. These findings provide indispensable evidence for the development of city-specific net-zero-emission goals within Japan. Furthermore, they exemplify the value of incorporating a temporal dimension into household carbon footprint analyses, thereby providing a broader perspective for future investigations in this field.

AB  - Agricultural carbon footprint (CF) evaluation plays an important role in climate change mitigation and national food security. Many studies have been conducted worldwide to evaluate the CF of rapeseed and its byproducts; however, only a few of these studies have considered finer-scale spatial-temporal heterogeneity. Considering the advantages of using detailed crop information extracted by remote sensing (RS) techniques, we attempted to integrate RS into life cycle assessments to improve rapeseed CF evaluation. A case study was conducted from 2021 to 2023 in one of the most important grain- and rapeseed-producing areas in Southwest China, namely, the Chengdu Plain, covering an area of 18,810.00 km2. The results of our study suggest that: (1) the proposed approach is applicable for high-resolution (10 m ∗ 10 m) rapeseed distribution mapping; (2) the farm-based CFs of rapeseed in the studied region range from 3333.08 to 4572.82 kgCO2-eq ha−1, while the product-based CFs (PCFs) vary from 1316.23 to 2443.95 kgCO2-eq t−1. Nitrogen fertilizer processing and its application are identified as the dominant contributors to upstream and downstream greenhouse emissions (GHGs), respectively; (3) the significant role of soil properties and soil organic carbon in influencing crop PCFs indicates good GHG offsets. The method used in the current study has strong adaptability and universality in different areas with various climatic conditions and can provide a solid basis for policymakers to formulate differentiated agricultural carbon reduction policies.

AB  - Implementing emission reduction policies at county level is important to realize high-quality development in the Yellow River Basin and achieve national “carbon peaking” and “carbon neutrality” goals. Based on remote-sensing data of night light, net primary productivity, and land use, the present study utilized the light‑carbon conversion and carbon footprint measurement models to quantify the carbon footprint of energy consumption. An exploratory spatiotemporal data analysis method was implemented to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution path. Panel quantile regression and spatiotemporal transition-nested models were used to reveal the influence mechanism of the spatiotemporal evolution of the carbon footprint. The following results were obtained. (1) The carbon footprint of counties increased from 2001 to 2020. Counties with high‑carbon footprint diffused around the “one center and two axes”. Carbon-deficit counties exhibited a diffused trend towards the west. In 2020, 506 counties exhibited carbon deficits, and the carbon balance of the ecosystem was severely unbalanced. (2) The carbon footprint showed evident path dependence and Matthew effect. The high‑carbon footprint lock-in area comprising 177 counties is a challenging zone for governance. The 86 counties that exhibit carbon footprint changes are the key zones to drive the carbon footprint changes in the Basin. The change direction of the county's carbon footprint type, with evident spatial correlation characteristics, is in accordance with adjacent counties. (3) The carbon footprint spatiotemporal transition types and influence mechanisms in counties exhibited significant differences, with the coexistence of low-carbon footprint driving, low-carbon footprint restriction, high-carbon footprint driving and high-carbon footprint restriction modes. As the influence mechanisms of different modes and the paths to achieve “dual carbon” goals are different, the governance of different modes should focus on optimizing and strengthening restriction factors or controlling and improving of driving factors.

AB  - The availability of models constitutes a key factor when selecting a decision support tool aimed at improving the production and environmental aspects of farms. There is a need for robust models that are user-friendly, facilitating the estimation of farm emissions and the analysis of their temporal fluctuations. The objectives of this study were i) to calculate both the partial (PCF) and total carbon (TCF) footprints of 212 dairy farms, distinguishing those with and without maize cultivation; ii) to identify critical variables related to feed, nutrition, productivity and environmental efficiency; and iii) to formulate and validate prediction equations based on available data from dairy farms. The database encompasses information from 212 dairy cattle farms situated in the temperate-humid zone of northern Spain, spanning the period from 2014 to 2018. Farm classification was based on the presence (CcMz) or absence (ScCMz) of maize cultivation for silage production, resulting in 96 farms in the CcMz category and 116 farms in the ScCMz category. Among the variables considered, the variable herd N-use efficiency (NUECR) for (PCF) showed the lowest root mean square error of prediction at 0.39% and the correspondingly lowest root men. The root mean squared percentage error (RMSPE): standard deviation ratio (RSR) at 0.52. In the case of total carbon footprint (TCF), herd N-use efficiency (NUECR) again showed the lowest root mean square error of prediction at 0.52%. Regarding TCF, herd feed efficiency (EACR) was the variable with the lowest both RMSPE and RSR, with 0.65 and 0.64, respectively. Consequently, the estimation of the PCF and TCF of 1 ​kg of milk from the temperate-humid zone of northern Spain at the farm gate can be feasibly accomplished utilizing NUECR and EACR, respectively.

AB  - One of the primary issues of sustainable consumption is that many individuals are uncertain about the environmental impact of their consumption choices and, consequently, they are uncertain how to adjust their habits to consume more sustainably. Carbon footprint tracking apps (CFTAs) seek to address this information gap by continuously educating consumers on their carbon emissions. Since the effectiveness of CFTAs has not yet been investigated at all, the authors developed a CFTA to explore whether and how such applications help shape consumption behavior. Over several survey rounds, 216 participants used the application to log their consumption in four main consumption domains. The results indicate that the feedback given can help decrease carbon emissions by 23%. The impact varies by consumption category, ranging from a 12% reduction in mobility to a 35% reduction in household activities. Moreover, individual traits influence the effectiveness of CFTA usage: Perceived green self-efficacy amplifies the feedback's effect, whereas a strong green self-identity diminishes it. Based on these results, the authors guide practitioners and academics on how to employ CFTAs to foster and research sustainable consumer behavior, and the authors show how to account for inter-individual differences when endorsing such apps. Future research should probe ways to boost effectiveness in specific areas and for particular personalities.

AB  - Energy storage is a crucial flexibility measure to temporally decouple power generation from power demand and is touted as the missing link in realizing a decarbonized energy system based on renewable energy. Energy storage capacity buildup at all levels of the global energy system is expected to accelerate the decarbonization process. To this end, a coherent mathematical framework to ascertain the carbon footprint of localized energy systems with energy storage is indispensable. This article presents an open-source energy system simulation program — Energy System Network (ESN). A variety of energy system configurations can be simulated with the Python program, which incorporates key energy system components such as generation, grid, storage, and loads. ESN features an integrated bottom-up approach that combines energy system modeling with streamlined life cycle assessment techniques to quantify the carbon footprint of all components in a localized energy system. The lifecycle phases of each component, including production, operation, and end-of-life treatment, can be considered. Carbon footprint values are obtained for two demonstrative case studies with lithium-ion battery applications: energy arbitrage and home energy systems. The metric Levelized Emissions of Energy Supply (LEES) has been used to evaluate the carbon footprint of each application. An unconventional energy arbitrage strategy designed to exploit the grid carbon intensity spreads instead of the energy price spreads manages to achieve a LEES value about 17% lower than the conventional variant. The influence of rooftop solar generation, battery energy storage system, and the energy management strategy on the LEES values for a home energy system is explored. A maximum LEES reduction of over 37% vis-á-vis the base scenario was observed with optimal energy management for the solar generation and the battery system. The open-source availability of ESN can contribute to transparency, comparability, and reproducibility in carbon footprint assessments of localized energy systems with energy storage.

AB  - By observing the disturbance of indicators, models, and samples variability to the robustness of low carbon performance evaluation, the importance of random errors and heterogeneity of sample data is clarified. The carbon footprint joint total factor productivity conceptual framework is proposed in this study, then we apply it to a food production system in a region of China to reasonably judge the carbon footprint performance level of peasant households. With regard to the single-output production frontier, the internal method changes did not cause significant changes in the level of crop production technical efficiency in the deterministic and stochastic estimation strategies respectively. Although the results of partial low-carbon economic technical efficiency are consistent in the two estimation strategies, a significant difference is obvious for the low-carbon technical efficiency; The total low-carbon economic technical efficiency is significantly different between deterministic non-parametric slacks-based measure and parameterized random distance function estimation strategies under the framework of the multi-output production frontier; Ultimately, the total factor productivity including the carbon footprint of the food system in our research area close to the technical level of the industry, as well as the technical efficiency of the sample is at an efficient level.

AB  - The Laser Direct Metal Deposition (LDMD) process offers notable advantages and obtains wide application in aerospace, defence equipment and other industrial sectors. However, the characteristics of multiple-inputs and low-efficiency in the process will bring about high carbon footprint. Additionally, the carbon footprint fluctuates with processing states and equipment systems owing to the discontinuous process in LDMD involving the layer-by-layer deposition and the laser-powder coupling. This paper investigated dynamic carbon footprint based on the resource and energy consumption from the process-oriented standpoint in LDMD process, which quantified the processing time, power distribution and material consumption of each processing state for every sub-system. In this research, the discontinuous process was divided into effective processing state, rapid moving state and transformed delay state and the processing time of each state were estimated with process parameters. Besides, the operating state time and power distribution of five sub-systems were estimated combining the equipment triggering mechanism and the processing state time. The orthogonal experiment was carried out to deposit the 316L stainless steel powder into parts with the size of 15 mm*15 mm*10 mm under the given process parameter conditions (Vf ∈ [8,12] g/min, P ∈ [600,1000] w, Vs ∈ [500,900] mm/min). The results show that carbon footprint of deposited parts fluctuates in the range of 3624.68–15759.08 g under parameter combinations and the low carbon footprint parameter-interval is obtained. The average carbon footprint of effective processing state, the transformed delay state and the rapid moving state account for 55%, 40% and 5% respectively, while the carbon footprint of powder supply sub-system contributes to 68% among the five sub-systems. This research revealed and qualified the dynamicity of carbon footprint at the levels of processing states, process parameters and sub-systems, offering potential for carbon footprint reduction in advanced manufacturing processes.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to present options to make low-carbon footprint large-scale desalination a reality on arid islands with weak electrical grids. Through these options, the goal is to reconfigure on-grid wind energy/desalination systems for large- and medium-scale water production. In this context, it is proposed to use lithium-ion batteries for stationary energy storage together with management strategies aimed at avoiding the wind energy/desalination systems having to consume energy from the conventional grid they are connected to. The control strategy is based on ensuring that the power provided by the wind farm and batteries remains in synchrony with the power demand of the desalination plant throughout the system's useful life. The interannual variation of wind energy is considered when sizing the renewable energy system and processes for its estimation are proposed. The case study is centred on the Canary Archipelago, a region that is especially vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, but which enjoys exceptional characteristics for the exploitation of wind energy. The results obtained show the optimal wind farm and energy storage system capacities of the analysed configurations. The approach presented allows a low-carbon operational footprint. If the control strategy were to be put into practice today, the current grid restrictions and a life cycle assessment of the system carried out in a societal context that continues to be fossil fuel dependent indicate a potential reduction of 77.4% of the footprint. However, the remaining 22.6% could be eliminated in the future when the manufacturing processes of wind turbines, batteries and desalination plants receive the benefits of carbon-neutral societies.

AB  - As a precautionary tool for decision-makings towards sustainable development, strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is quite promising in coping with climate change by taking the advantage of alternatives evaluation as early intervention and planning optimization. Despite of the acknowledged merits, the current alternatives evaluation has presented a weakness when tackling with the climate factors in practice due to an evident lack of carbon-related indicators. The challenge is even more pronounced in hydropower planning for the most sensitive response to climate, the most complicated impacts to evaluate and the recent doubts about the nature as a clean energy. Considering the assignable carbon emissions from the hydropower engineering including pre-treatment, construction, operation and decommission, six indicators of carbon footprint were selected and integrated with the conventional eco-environment and socio-economic considerations for evaluating four alternatives in the SEA of Upper Yellow River hydropower planning in China. The total 24 indicators were marked by the invited experts, and weighted by employing the BP neural network. The ranked marks from invited experts and improved by BP neural network weighting showed that the alternative II is the best among the four, indicating the slightest environmental impacts, the minimal carbon emissions, and the highest socio-economic benefits. This study delivered an improved framework based on the conventional rapid impact assessment method (RIAM) and carbon footprint assessment, and provided a practical technical solution for evaluating planning alternatives in the context of green hydropower development.

AB  - Microalgae biomass energy is an environmentally friendly and sustainable renewable energy source. Accelerating its development can address energy scarcity, improve the environment, and achieve carbon sequestration and emission reduction goals. However, research on calculating carbon footprints for biomass energy production is deficient. Existing evaluation methods fail to allocate emission responsibilities and inadequately assessed the low-carbon production potential of biomass energy. This study presents a comprehensive method for calculating and evaluating carbon footprints, enabling direct estimation of product carbon emissions and analysis of the potential for low-carbon production in various industries. This method aimed to calculate the carbon footprint of microalgae biodiesel production and evaluate it using specific evaluation parameters. The results demonstrated that the carbon footprint of microalgae biodiesel is −2995.37 kg CO2/ton. The calculated microalgae biodiesel production exhibits a significant negative carbon emission, accurately depicting the carbon footprint of the entire biodiesel production process. Based on these carbon footprint results and evaluation parameters, improvements were made to the biodiesel production process, and its development prospects were explored. The novel approach presented to calculate and assess carbon footprints in energy production can provide valuable theoretical insights and technical support to promote low-carbon development and carbon reduction in the energy industry.

AB  - The correct management of renewable polygeneration systems is a highly effective approach that can not only help expand renewable energy systems but also ensure sustainable production. In the present work, a new procedure for designing renewable polygeneration systems is introduced. In this procedure, the management of polygeneration systems is discussed from various aspects, including climatic change, techno-economic and environmental conditions, layout design, ecological sustainability, and the sociological approach to polygeneration systems in a practical form. As a case study, an innovative biomass-solar-wind polygeneration system to produce power, ammonia, and freshwater for Ahvaz in Iran was designed and evaluated according to the developed procedure. The integration of multi-effect distillation and humidification-dehumidification desalination has been employed for freshwater production. For ammonia production, syngas produced in the gasification unit and nitrogen obtained from the air separation unit were utilized. Power production has been achieved using a combination of the hydrogen-ammonia Brayton cycle, the supercritical carbon dioxide cycle, and the organic Rankine cycle. The designed system was evaluated using energy, exergy, exergoeconomic, exergoenvironmental, emergoeconomic, emergoenvironmental, carbon footprint, and water footprint analyses. The layout design of the proposed system and the sociological study of the system from a systemic approach have enhanced the visibility of its application. Additionally, the investigation of biomass fuel variations and combinations according to climate, along with optimization and dynamic analyses, are key measures that allow for a more comprehensive evaluation of the system from various management perspectives. The results show that the proposed system is capable of producing 523.34 m3/day freshwater, 10.1 MW of power, and storing 17.75 ton/day of ammonia in optimal state. The energy and exergy efficiency of the polygeneration system in the optimal state is 29.97% and 13.12%. The total cost rate and total environmental impact rate of the entire system in this case are equal to 0.48 $/s and 19.79 mPts/s, respectively. Meanwhile, the defined renewable system has an ecological sustainability index of 1.76.

AB  - Background
The healthcare sector has an environmental impact of around 4.6% of global CO2 emissions, contributing to aggravating the climate crisis. However, the impact of the health sector’s emissions on human health is not regularly assessed. We aim to estimate the health burden and associated costs of the health sector’s carbon footprint within the European Union (EU).
Methods
We calculated disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and associated costs based on human health damage factors (DALYs/kg-CO2e) by considering four scenarios. Three scenarios for shared socioeconomic pathways (S1 – high growth, S2 − baseline, and S3 − low growth) represented variations of global society, demographics, and economics until 2100. A fourth scenario (S4) considered the current EU’s 55% reduction goal of greenhouse gas emissions. The healthcare sector’s emissions per capita (in CO2-equivalent) in 2019 were extracted from the Lancet Countdown, and population data were retrieved from Eurostat for the same year.
Results
In the EU, 365,047 DALYs (95%CI: 194,692–535,403) are expected to be caused by the health sector’s emissions at baseline (S2). In an S1 scenario, the burden would slightly decrease to 316,374 DALYs (95%CI: 170,355–462,393), whereas a S3 scenario would increase 486,730 DALYs (95%CI: 243,365–681,422). If EU’s carbon goals are met, the burden could be substantially reduced to 164,271 DALYs (95%CI: 87,611–240,931). Costs can amount to 25.6 billion euros, when considering DALYs monetisation.
Conclusion
CO2 emissions from the health sector are expected to significantly impact human health. Therefore, it is important to ensure that EU climate policies for public buildings are in line with the Paris Agreement, increase funding for climate mitigation programs within the healthcare sector, and review clinical practices at the local level.

AB  - Introduction
Reducing costs and carbon footprints are important, parallel priorities for the US health-care system. Within surgery, reducing the number of instruments that are sterilized and disposable supplies that are used for each operation may help achieve both goals. We wanted to measure the existing variability in surgical instrument and supply choices and assess whether standardization could have a meaningful cost and environmental impact.
Methods
We analyzed surgeon preference cards for common general surgery operations at our hospital to measure the number of sterilizable instrument trays and supplies used by each surgeon for each operation. From this data, we calculated supply costs, carbon footprint, and median operative time and studied the variability in each of these metrics.
Results
Among the ten operations studied, variability in sterilizable instrument trays requested on surgeon preference cards ranged from one to eight. Variability in disposable supplies requested ranged from 17 to 45. Variability in open supply costs ranged from $104 to $4184. Variability in carbon footprint ranged from 17 to 708 kg CO2e. If the highest-cost surgeon for each operation switched their preference card to that of the median-cost surgeon, $245,343 in open supply costs and 41,708 kg CO2e could be saved.
Conclusions
There is significant variability in the instrument and supply choices of surgeons performing common general surgery operations. Standardizing this variability may lead to meaningful cost savings and carbon footprint reduction, especially if scaled across the entire health system.

AB  - Lei bamboo shoots are extensively used in the food processing industry, producing solid waste such as bamboo shoot shells and liquid wastewater. This study analyzed several sewage indicators, revealing that the majority exceed the national standards of China for direct water discharge. A field experiment was conducted over a period of 4 months to evaluate the effects of different treatments during the natural decomposition of bamboo shoot shells.The treatment groups consisted of the boiled experimental group (EG) and the control group (CG). Results showed that in EG, the methane emission increased by 8.6% (P < 0.05), the carbon dioxide emission increased significantly by 19.7% (P < 0.01), and the nitrous oxide emission decreased by 37.9% (P < 0.01) relative to those in CG. Regression analysis was employed to establish a relationship model between CH4, CO2, and N2O emission fluxes and temperature and humidity in the EG and CG groups. A specific functional relationship was identified between CH4 and CO2 emission fluxes and temperature and humidity, but N2O emission was present. No significant correlation was found between flux and ambient temperature and humidity (R2 < 0.3). We also estimated that the carbon dioxide emissions and water consumption of producing 1 kg of canned bamboo shoots were 2.8669 kg and 86.8 L, covering the processes in the life cycle of bamboo shoot products. This study identifies the potential water pollution problems and provides insights into resource utilization and recycling in bamboo shoot food processing, facilitating the realization of clean production processes. It also sheds light on the water footprint of bamboo shoot products throughout their life cycle, and the carbon footprint research provides valuable references.

AB  - This paper examines the portfolio carbon footprint of Indian banking system. To this end, we combine the emissions data from India's Biennial Update Reports to UNFCCC and Reserve Bank of India's bank database from 2010 to 2016; apply Network for Greening the Financial System's backward-looking methodology and Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials Standards in conjunction with Leontief's Input-Output technique to estimate the weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of bank's loans portfolio at three levels – System level, Bank group level and Spatial level. Our major findings include-first, at system level, the carbon footprint of Indian banks shows a rising trend over the study period with the aggregate WACI of bank loans increasing by 9.4% from 332.5 tCO2e/US$ million in 2010 to 363.7 tCO2e/US$ million in 2016. Second, at the group level, while the financed emissions of public sector banks have plateaued, for private sector banks they have nearly doubled during the study period, suggesting the increased exposure to carbon intensive assets. Third, on the spatial level, top five regions by WACI include Delhi, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana in descending order.

AB  - Drawing from a 60 cross-country dataset, this study examined the association between political connections and carbon footprint. Based on carbon emissions and carbon intensity measures, a positive and highly significant association between political connected (PCON) firms and carbon footprint was documented. The study also found that the carbon footprint results were largely driven by direct carbon emissions, while the effect of political connections was stronger for state owned enterprise (SOE). The baseline findings were found to be robust to endogeneity test. Further tests revealed that higher carbon footprint emitted from PCON firms was more pronounced in advanced economies, and in carbon-intensive industries. However, the study found that stronger institutional governance could partially alleviate the significant and positive association between PCON firms and carbon footprint.

AB  - Climate change mitigation to the 1.5 °C calls for significant and extensive climate actions. Nordic countries are showing high engagement to climate change mitigation while the consumption and lifestyle-based carbon footprints are among the global highest. Majority of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are connected to household consumption where various behavioral changes have been presented in order to reduce the personal carbon footprints. Previous research has shown how behaviors are connected to the living environment and urban structure, which have shown having an impact in forming variations in our lifestyles and behavioral patterns. In this study, with a survey dataset of ∼8000 respondents across the five Nordic countries, the engagement of respondents to different climate and carbon mitigation actions were analyzed and linked to their calculated carbon footprints. Three types of behavioral clusters were found among the respondents, one presenting conscious pro-climate behavior, one relating to frugality behavior, and one cluster related to self-sufficient behavior. The pro-climate behavioral intentions were present more in urbanized areas together with high climate motivation, whereas frugality behavior was level across the urban gradient, and finally respondents from less urbanized areas emphasized self-sufficient behavior. The stated behavioral intentions of the respondents were in contrast to their carbon footprints. Carbon footprints related to leisure consumption were highest in the urban regions and everyday consumption related footprints in the rural regions. Interestingly, only frugality behavior was associated with lower carbon footprints both in everyday and leisure consumption categories, whereas climate conscious behavior was positively related to leisure consumption footprint but negatively related to everyday consumption. The findings emphasize the variation of lifestyles based on different actions in different urban forms where the engagement to climate change mitigation presents differently. The results underline the importance of understanding the role that the built environment plays in being linked to the behavioral patterns and the need to increase the knowledge of the climate impacts of behavioral choices.

AB  - Developing nations have emerged as integral contributors to the global economy since the beginning of the 21st century. Their swift economic expansion and associated activities lead to a rise in carbon footprint. Keeping this in view, unlike previous studies, this study unfolds the asymmetric repercussions of competitive industrial performance and renewable energy within the context of the industrialization era in seven Asian developing countries from 1990 to 2020. The panel NARDL and asymmetric panel causality methodologies have been applied for the purpose of nonlinear analysis. According to the results, the advantageous influence of competitive industrial performance is considerably more pronounced than that of industrialization. The coefficient magnitude associated with the negative shock demonstrates a significantly substantial value in comparison to the positive shock concerning the influence of competitive industrial performance on carbon footprint. Both positive and negative changes in competitive industrial performance mitigate carbon footprint. Renewable energy generates favorable consequences by promoting environmental quality via a reduction in carbon footprint. Across various emerging economies in Asia, the rapid rise of industrialization is linked to the deterioration of environmental quality. Finally, artificial intelligence and natural resource rents decrease carbon footprints while information and communication technology intensifies environmental concerns. The research emphasizes the critical nature of integrating artificial intelligence, robotics, and technological industrial competitiveness in order to adequately tackle the carbon footprint in Asian developing countries.

AB  - The ambitious goal of reaching net-zero worldwide has promoted the development of renewable energy, but the seemingly green energy also requires massive resource and energy consumption during its lifecycle. Especially for China, the top solar panel manufacturer and user, the environmental impacts of solar systems should be concerned in the long-term, particularly in the field of retired photovoltaic (PV) recycling. However, provincial carbon footprints of solar panels based on different production and waste treatment techniques have not been estimated before, including the accumulated and potentially reduced amount of carbon footprints (compared with designed optimal scenarios) in China. This research aims to calculate the total and reduced carbon footprints of solar panels by using the provincial electricity generation data of PVs in China. Results show that the national accumulated carbon emissions of installed panels from 2011 to 2035 would exceed 5 Gt CO2eq by 2060. With advanced production technology and efficient waste treatment, the emissions could be significantly reduced by 50% for the whole lifecycle and 36% for recycling. Although large emission variations existed among provinces, the dominant emission sources shifted from the northwest to eastern regions of China in recent years. Our study provides fundamental guidance to the governmental regulations of waste PVs as well as technological development of recycling treatment scenarios.

AB  - We examine individuals' willingness to pay to offset their carbon footprint (WTPO) in response to receiving information about (i) their own carbon footprint size (size nudge), and (ii) receiving information about their own carbon footprint size and the gap with per-capita GHG emissions consistent with the 1.5 °C target (distance-to-target nudge). We employ a demographically representative online survey among the adult population in Germany which includes a carbon footprint calculator and the randomized information nudges. Results from estimating double-hurdle regression models suggest that the size nudge increases participants' average WTPO by about one third. Yet, we find only limited support that the distance-to-target nudge affects participants' WTPO. We further find that participants' response to the information nudge is primarily effective for younger participants, females, participants with mid-range income, with high levels of education, and with low to medium-sized carbon footprints, ceteris paribus. Further, the WTPO is positively related with income, education, carbon literacy, and environmental preferences. Also, participants tend to underestimate the size of their carbon footprint relative to that of others. We find no evidence, however, that participants' WTPO depends on whether they believe that their carbon footprint is lower or higher than that of others.

AB  - The literature on the environmental impacts of household consumption in India focuses on carbon and ecological footprints of income groups. This article connects conspicuous/luxury (C/L) consumption in India to its local, regional and global environmental impacts. We evaluate carbon dioxide (CO2), water, and particulate matter (PM2.5) footprints of consumption disaggregated into food-basic, nonfood-basic, and C/L consumption across expenditure deciles. We find that all three footprints rise, but at different rates, with increasing expenditure. Notably, CO2 and PM2.5 intensities of C/L consumption increase with income, unlike all other intensities of consumption. However, in all three footprints, there is a disproportionate rise in the top decile, which is driven by C/L consumption expenditure more than the pollution intensity of C/L consumption. These results imply that demand reduction measures in C/L consumption could have broad-based and deep environmental benefits, while pollutant-specific mitigation policies may face trade-offs with other environmental impacts. There is a need for further research on connecting local and regional environmental footprints with the actual impacts, to better understand the relationships between conspicuous/luxury consumption and multi-dimensional environmental impacts in developing countries context.

AB  - Context
Securing food and energy supplies presents a significant challenge to human survival and progress. The rice-wheat rotation is one of the main food crop systems in China. However, no comprehensive assessment of the water footprint (WF), carbon footprint (CF), carbon production efficiency (CPE), and net ecosystem economic benefits (NEEB) of different rice-wheat rotation systems has been reported.
Objective
This study was conducted to assess the productivity, WF, CF, CPE, and NEEB of dry direct-seeded, wet direct-seeded, and transplanted rice-wheat (TR-W) rotation systems. The objective was to provide theoretical guidance for the development of clean and sustainable rice-wheat rotation production technology systems.
Methods
We used a split-plot design, with the main plots being the dry direct-seeded, wet direct-seeded, and transplanted rice planting methods, and the subplots consisting of two rice genotypes. Dry direct-seeded rice was mainly rainfed, ensuring that the soil remained relatively dry so that the soil is kept aerobic during the whole reproductive period of rice. Wet direct-seeded rice continues to keep the soil moist after sowing; the plots were maintained under a water layer of 3–10 cm following the emergence of 4.5 leaves, a condition that persisted until two weeks prior to the rice harvest. Transplanted rice was maintained under a water layer of 3–10 cm following transplanting until 2 weeks prior to the rice harvest. Subsequent to the rice harvest, the above-ground rice stubble was removed, and the ground was tilled with a rotary tiller in preparation for the subsequent wheat planting.
Results
Results demonstrated that the annual yield from the dry direct-seeded rice-wheat (DR-W) rotation system was comparable to the wet direct-seeded rice-wheat (WR-W) rotation system, while significantly lower than that of the TR-W rotation system. However, the WF of DR-W rotation system was 45.96% and 33.94% lower than that of WR-W and TR-W rotation systems, respectively, and the CF was 35.57% and 25.87% lower than that of WR-W and TR-W rotation systems, respectively. Therefore, its water and carbon production efficiencies were higher than those of WR-W and TR-W rotation systems. In addition, NEEB in DR-W and TR-W was comparable and significantly higher than that in WR-W.
Conclusions
The DR-W rotation was a promising rotation system according to the comparable annual yield, lower water and carbon footprints, higher CPE, and comparable or higher NEEB in comparison with other rice-wheat rotation systems.
Significance
We suggest that the DR-W rotation should be promoted as the primary production mode for the rice-wheat rotation.

AB  - The integration of solar full-spectrum and wind devices into district energy systems presents a promising avenue for reducing fuel consumption and advancing renewable energy utilization. To meet the heat and power demands of an industrial park, a solar-wind-gas coupling system is proposed, leveraging an organic Rankine cycle for efficient utilization of renewable and waste heat. Through the optimization of profit maximization via integrated demand response and carbon trading mechanisms, the specific carbon footprint in an ecological perspective considering both direct and indirect emissions is estimated. The findings reveal significant cost savings for users exceeding $400 through the demand response method, alongside a 5% reduction in operating costs for the system through carbon trading, albeit with elevated carbon footprints in energy and exergy domains. Moreover, higher carbon prices are shown to enhance profits due to increased award costs in carbon trading, while concurrently resulting in heightened ecological carbon emissions. This research extends traditional dispatching methods by integrating ecological carbon footprint analysis, offering valuable insights for sustainable energy management strategies.

AB  - Mitigation actions in all sectors of society, including sports, to limit global warming have become an increasingly hot topic in public discussions and sports management. However, so far, there has been a lack of understanding and practical examples of how these organizations, especially in team sports, can holistically assess and reduce their climate impacts to achieve carbon neutrality. This paper presents a carbon footprint assessment, implemented actions for GHG emission reduction, and offers the example of a professional Finnish ice hockey team that achieved carbon neutrality. The study is based on a life cycle assessment method. The Results show that the team's carbon footprint was reduced from 350 tCO2eq by more than 50% between seasons 2018–2019 and 2021–2022 in the assessed categories. The most GHG emission reductions were achieved in the team's and spectators' mobility and ice hall energy consumption. Furthermore, the team compensated for their remaining emissions to achieve carbon neutrality. Multiple possibilities for further GHG emission reductions were recognized. The majority of the GHG emissions were linked to the Scope 3 category, indicating that co-operation with partners and stakeholders was a key to success in attaining carbon neutrality. This paper also discusses the possible limitations and challenges that sport organizations face in assessing climate impacts and reducing GHG emissions, as well as the prospects of overcoming them. Since there are many opportunities for sports to contribute to climate change mitigation, relevant targets and actions to reduce GHG emissions should be integrated into all sport organizations' management.

AB  - Summary
The ecological sustainability of the operating room (OR) is a matter of recent interest. The present systematic review aimed to review the current literature assessing the carbon footprint of surgical procedures in different surgical fields. Following to the PRISMA statement checklist, three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library) were searched by independent reviewers, who screened records on title and abstract first, and then on the full text. Risk of bias was evaluated using the MINORS system. Over the 878 articles initially identified, 36 original studies were included. They considered ophthalmologic surgical procedures (30.5%), general/digestive surgery (19.4%), gynecologic procedures (13.9%), orthopedic procedures (8.3%), neurosurgery (5.5%), otolaryngology/head and neck surgery (5.5%), plastic/dermatological surgery (5.5%), and cardiac surgery (2.8%). Despite a great methodological heterogeneity, data showed that a single surgical procedure emits 4–814 kgCO2e, with anesthetic gases and energy consumption representing the largest sources of greenhouse gas emission. Minimally invasive surgical techniques may require more resources than conventional open surgery, particularly for packaging and plastics, energy use, and waste production. Each OR has the potential to produce from 0.2 to 4kg of waste per case with substantial differences depending on the type of intervention, hospital setting, and geographic area. Overall, the selected studies were found to be of moderate quality. Based on a qualitative synthesis of the available literature, the OR can be targeted by programs and protocols implemented to reduce the carbon footprint and improve the waste stream of the OR.

AB  - The environmental impacts of municipal solid waste have become a critical issue in Iran due to rising waste generation and limited waste treatment methods. From a global warming perspective, in 2018, Iran was the seventh-highest greenhouse gas emitter in the world. An implementation should demonstrate that it is possible to estimate the environmental impact of climate change. A simple carbon footprint estimation model for waste-to-energy power plants with a life cycle assessment using the 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines is presented in this study. For this purpose, first the system boundary is determined. Then, the total emissions of each part within boundary are identified in terms of total greenhouse gas emission (and expressed in mass of carbon dioxide equivalent). In conclusion, the carbon footprint of generating one kWh of electricity is estimated. The final emission of the Tehran power plant is calculated at 24.46 ktCO2eq/year. Thus, the carbon footprint is estimated to be 1351.94 g CO2eq/kWh. Key parameters that affect carbon footprint are divided into two groups: emission parameters and electricity generation parameters. The sensitivity analysis of effective parameters showed the distance travelled and weight of waste transported during waste transportation, the fossil carbon content in waste composition has the highest effect on carbon footprint. The study shows a 1.2-fold difference between the carbon footprint of two current scenarios of waste treatment: landfill and waste-to-energy plant. The life cycle emissions of landfills exceed of waste-to-energy plants, indicating that these systems can contribute significantly to addressing the current environmental challenges. Additionally, they offer advantages in terms of electricity generation.

AB  - In this paper, we analyze the carbon footprint of Castilla-La Mancha households, a region of the so-called “empty Spain,” and their mitigation potential. For this purpose, we use the environmentally extended multiregional input-output model and the Spanish Households Budget Survey to extract expenditure microdata by municipality size. We find that households in smaller municipalities have a larger total carbon footprint due to their higher direct emissions. Although their consumption is lower than other municipalities, they have a more intensive pattern of embedded carbon consumption. Households in smaller municipalities spend a higher share in private transport and housing-related activities, emitting almost an additional ton of direct carbon emissions. Regarding their mitigation potential, results show that for every euro that municipalities with less than 10,000 inhabitants reduce their consumption, they would reduce emissions by 0.796 kgCO2. However, while the size of the municipality increases, the mitigation potential decreases (0.378 kgCO2 for more than 100,000 inhabitants). This highest mitigation potential will only be achieved if mitigation policies especially favor their inhabitants and if infrastructures and social services are developed to facilitate a change in their consumption patterns.

AB  - As one of the most vital wood-based products, the carbon footprint of wooden doors has received increasing attention in recent years. The studies on the carbon footprints of different types of wooden doors are few. In this study, the cradle-to-grave carbon footprints of three types of wooden doors produced in China were comparatively analyzed. Models used for calculating the total life-cycle carbon footprint of a wood-based composite door, a solid wood composite door, and a solid wood door were developed. Considering the biogenic carbon storage and its delayed emissions, the wood-based composite door, solid wood composite door, and solid wood door featured carbon footprints of 0.379, 0.257, and −0.277 kg CO2 e per kg product, respectively. The solid wood door exhibited a negative carbon footprint, indicating that its carbon storage was higher than the carbon emission during the life cycle stage. The raw material acquisition (38%–66%) and the transportation stages (23%–38%) of the three types of wooden doors were the main contributors to the total carbon footprints (excluding the biogenic carbon). The product manufacturing stage released relatively small emissions (11%–24%). The waste disposal treatment at the end-of-life phase, the degradation of wood materials in landfills, and their service life displayed significant impacts on the carbon footprints of the three types of wooden doors. Fiberboard, laminated veneer lumber, sawn lumber, finger-jointed lumber, and electricity were identified as the main emission hotspots. This study provides guidelines for low-carbon development in the wooden door industry.

Hence, this study considers a sample of 33 members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and checks whether reducing exposure to different forms of country risks, in the presence of international trade and clean energy consumption, can reduce their respective carbon footprint levels. Utilizing annual data from 2000 to 2018 and employing methods that handle problems related to dependence across cross-sectional units and heterogeneity of slope coefficients, the findings endorse that (a) reducing financial and political risks abate carbon footprints, (b) economic risk exposure does not influence carbon footprints, (c) international trade exerts carbon footprint-boosting effects, and (d) undergoing unclean to clean energy transition curbs carbon footprints. Accordingly, the concerned governments should these findings into account while conceptualizing green environmental policies in the future.

AB  - Extensive research has explored land use and land cover change (LULCC) in tropical ecosystems, but more detailed carbon footprint data is essential for defining strategies to enhance carbon sinks. This study assessed LULCC and its associated carbon footprints in different natural ecosystems. It also established forest reference levels (FRL). We used Landsat images for supervised classification and conducted forest inventories in 186 plots that span moist semi-deciduous forest, swamp forest, gallery forest, woodland and savannah areas. Biomass calculations employed allometric models, biomass expansion factors, and root-to-shoot ratios. Except in Lama Forest Reserve, anthropogenic pressures led to the regressive conversion of natural forest areas to savannah, croplands, and fallows. A progressive trend was observed in semi-deciduous forest (3.18 % per year), resulting in a positive LULC carbon footprint (16.06 tCO2eq.yr−1ha−1). 41.94 % of typical swamp forest was lost, releasing -62.89 tCO2eq.yr−1ha−1. Similarly, woodland decreased by -1.48 and -5.89 % per year, according to considered site, with emissions of -12.16 and -21.83 tCO2eq.yr−1ha−1, respectively. FRL followed the gradient of canopy cover of the different vegetation types. The results highlight the need for adequate conservation and management, considering land use and cover specifics, and provide useful baselines for REDD+ activities in countries with similar ecosystems.

AB  - Mitigating climate change, improving economic growth, and reducing income inequality are three of Sustainable Development Goals (17 SDGs). It has been well understood that economic growth has a significant impact on carbon footprint, but it remains unclear whether this impact will be mitigated or intensified by reducing income inequality. By applying the Multi-Regional Input-Output model, this study assesses the consumption-based carbon footprints of 43 major economies over the period 1995–2019 and conducts the corresponding empirical analysis. Through examining the moderating effect of income inequality (Gini coefficient) on the relationship between economic growth (GDP per capita) and consumption-based carbon footprint (CO2 per capita), we demonstrate that a lower Gini coefficient – a more equitable distribution of income − could significantly promote the decoupling of economic growth from carbon footprint. The results also show a heterogeneous moderating effect of income inequality – reducing income inequality in rich countries helps decouple economic growth from carbon footprint more than in poor countries. This study contributes to a better understanding of the synergy among economic growth (SDG 8), income inequality reduction (SDG 10), and carbon mitigation (SDG 13). Given that reducing income inequality in the context of economic growth can have significant benefits for carbon mitigation, we would suggest that income inequality reduction should be incorporated into climate action, particularly in rich countries.

AB  - Hydropower is usually considered as a low-carbon electricity source, as it does not lead to direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, unlike producing electricity from fossil fuels. However, the flooding of lands following the construction of the dam generally leads to an increase in biogenic GHG emissions due to the degradation of biomass found in the newly created reservoir. The life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology is widely used to calculate and compare the carbon footprint of different electricity production pathways, while considering all life cycle stages. Net biogenic GHG emissions from hydropower reservoirs have been poorly considered in LCA because of the scarcity of data. These emissions are complex to quantify as several mechanisms are involved, and extrapolating observations from one reservoir to another is risky as emissions vary greatly depending on different parameters, such as climate, geographic location, age of impoundment, and watershed properties. The objective of this article is to compare different approaches to estimate hydropower reservoir emissions in LCA, to select the most appropriate one, and to apply it to the calculation of the carbon footprint of electricity distributed in the Canadian province of Québec. Net biogenic GHG emissions of all hydropower reservoirs in the province (with 2.5 and 97.5% confidence intervals), as estimated using the G-res model, are 16.5 (14.7–18.6) gCO2∙kWh−1 and 0.29 (0.23–0.35) gCH4∙kWh−1. Combined to ecoinvent data for other life cycle emissions, the carbon footprint of electricity distributed in the province in 2017 is 34.5 gCO2eq∙kWh−1.

AB  - This study explores whether increasing renewable energy consumption can alleviate environmental pressures (per capita carbon emissions and per capita ecological footprint) and the heterogeneity of the effects of increasing renewable energy consumption on the environmental pressures of countries in different income groups. We analyze 130 countries and three income groups from 1992 to 2019 based on a panel threshold regression estimation approach. The results show that (i) There is a negative relationship between renewable energy consumption and per capita ecological footprint and per capita carbon emissions, indicating that renewable energy consumption alleviates environmental pressure. (ii) When renewable energy consumption increases, the negative effects of renewable energy on per capita ecological footprint and per capita carbon emissions become more significant. This means that the more renewable energy is developed, the more it helps to alleviate environmental pressure. (iii) The inhibitory effect of renewable energy consumption on per capita ecological footprint is more significant in low-income countries than in middle-income countries. This indicates that renewable energy is more effective in reducing environmental pressures in poor countries than in rich countries.

AB  - To reduce pollution and carbon emissions, a quantitative evaluation of the carbon footprint of the wastewater treatment processes is crucial. However, micro carbon element flow analysis is rarely focused considering treatment efficiency of different technology. In this research, a comprehensive carbon footprint analysis is established under the micro carbon element flow analysis and macro carbon footprint analysis based on life cycle assessment (LCA). Three wastewater treatment processes (i.e., anaerobic anoxic oxic, A2O; cyclic activated sludge technology, CAST; modified cyclic activated sludge technology, M-CAST) for low carbon source urban wastewater are selected. The micro key element flow analysis illustrated that carbon source mainly flows to the assimilation function to promote microorganism growth. The carbon footprint analysis illustrated that M-CAST as the optimal wastewater treatment process had the lowest global warming potential (GWP). The key to reduce carbon emissions is to limit electricity consumption in wastewater treatment processes. Under the comprehensive carbon footprint analysis, M-CAST has the lowest environmental impact with low carbon emissions. The sensitivity analysis results revealed that biotreatment section variables considerably reduced the environmental impact on the LCA and the GWP, followed by the sludge disposal section. With this research, the optimization scheme can guide wastewater treatment plants to optimize relevant treatment sections and reduce pollution and carbon emissions.

AB  - Energy sovereignty and carbon footprint mitigation are challenges faced by island electricity systems (IES), along with the promotion of renewable generation systems. One of the aspects that can improve this is the development of specific actions in the recovery of agricultural waste as biofuels. Among them, the banana residue stands out, as it is the majority in agricultural production in the Canary Islands. On the other hand, biofuels are alternatives to fossil fuels that contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This article studies the potential of waste, the transformation of the existing sugars in the fruit waste of the Canarian banana to transform it into a 100% renewable fuel, bioethanol and, therefore, the environmental impact that it has on banana production, its new carbon footprint.

AB  - Economic expansion often causes multifaceted damages to environmental well-being. Thus, the persistent degradation in the global environment has become a concerning issue for both developed and developing regions across the world. Against this backdrop, this study checks how the per capita carbon footprint figures of the developed Group of Seven (G7) and the developing Emerging Seven (E7) countries are influenced by energy productivity improvement, institutional quality, and other key macroeconomic factors. Considering annual data from 2000 to 2020, advanced panel data estimation techniques that are robust against data-related problems such as endogeneity, heterogeneous slope coefficients, and dependency among the cross-sectional units are utilized. Overall, the results certify that making productive use of energy reduces consumption-based carbon footprints in E7 countries but not in G7 countries. Besides, improving institutional quality is seen to not only reduce carbon footprints in both samples directly but also indirectly mediate and moderate the energy productivity-carbon footprint nexus in G7 and E7 countries, respectively. Moreover, financial globalization is observed to minimize carbon footprints in G7 countries while boosting them in E7 countries. Contrastingly, financial development is observed to homogeneously boost the carbon footprint levels of both G7 and E7 countries. Lastly, international trade is found not to influence the carbon footprint levels in both samples of countries. Therefore, taking these major findings into consideration, a set of policies apart from making optimal use of energy are recommended for inhibiting the consumption-based carbon footprint figures of the concerned countries.

AB  - Food production is an important source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Quantifying the carbon footprint of all the major food categories in different continents is critical for accurately evaluating various aspects of GHG emissions from food production on a continental and global scale. Such information, however, is lacking. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis of plant-based and animal-based food production in all continents comprehensively using 5353 carbon footprint values from 524 published papers and calculated GHG emissions from food production (system boundary is from cradle to farm gate) at the continental and global scale. Our results indicate that the average carbon footprint of plant-based foods amounts to 0.66 kg CO2-eq kg−1, which is only 10.7% of animal-based foods (6.15 kg CO2-eq kg−1). The carbon footprint of plant-based food in Asia and Europe is 8.9%–184% higher than that of other continents. Africa has the lowest carbon footprint for plant-based foods, owing to its low agricultural input and limited crop management. However, the carbon footprint of animal-based foods in Africa and Asia is 2.5%–150% higher than that of other continents, with North America and Oceania recording the lowest. Total annual GHG emission from global food production reached 8125 Mt CO2-eq, with grains, meat, and milk together accounting for 70.8%. Asia, owing to its large production, emerged as the largest emitter, accounting for 55.4% of global GHG emissions. It was followed by Europe (16.3%) and North America (10.5%), while Africa, South America and Oceania together emit 17.8%. In summary, our study presents the most comprehensive account of the carbon footprint of food production at the continental and global scale to-date, which will help develop strategies and policies to reduce GHG emissions at various levels such as geographical regions, food and nutrition security, resource availability and resource use.

AB  - This paper explores the impact of providing carbon footprint information on long-haul international air travel demand. By combining the doubly randomized preference trial (DRPT) and randomized conjoint experiment, the paper examines how targeted information influences consumers’ purchasing decisions. The primary data is obtained from an online survey conducted in Japan with 3261 respondents. The results show that providing carbon footprint information significantly affects consumers’ choices, particularly those with higher environmental awareness. The provision of carbon footprint information increases the purchasing probability of environmentally conscious consumers by 12.3% over mileage accrual rate information. Moreover, when carbon emissions increase by 50%, respondents with higher environmental concerns are 17% less likely to make a purchase compared to those who do not prioritize environmental factors. This study holds implications for designing effective environmental awareness campaigns in the transport sector to encourage sustainable consumer choices.

AB  - A comprehensive investigation into the carbon and water footprint of a black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) farm in Murcia, Spain, was carried out following ISO 14064-1 standards. The study, utilizing data from BioflyTech, the managing company, spanned various departments to comprehensively analyze production and consumption. The results highlight that the carbon footprint associated with fresh larva production is approximately thirty times lower than that of conventional animal farming, aligning with sustainable practices and offering a promising alternative in the quest for eco-friendly protein sources. Moreover, the water footprint of the black soldier fly farm is significantly lower than that of traditional animal farms, underscoring the environmental advantages of this innovative approach to larva production over conventional livestock farming. These valuable insights contribute substantively to the ongoing discourse on sustainable and responsible agricultural practices, paving the way for more environmentally friendly solutions in the ever-evolving landscape of sustainable food production practices.

AB  - In the process of accounting for product carbon footprints, data quality is a key requirement. To mitigate the impacts of uncertainty, dynamism, and coupling in carbon data during product carbon footprint accounting, a method based on multi-level dynamic allocation of carbon data between organizations and products is proposed. First, considering the complex distribution and merging relationships between organizational carbon emissions and product carbon footprints, an AAC (Accounting Allocation Correlation) model between the two is constructed. Then, through EIS (Enterprise Information System), carbon data is obtained, and a multi-level dynamic allocation method for carbon data, as well as a Monte Carlo-based method for merging carbon data, is proposed for the dynamic accounting of product carbon footprints. Finally, using high-voltage switchgear as a case study, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method are validated.

AB  - Household carbon footprints significantly contribute to global carbon emissions, yet the limited features hinder the accurate assessment in regions with inadequate data. In this study, we developed a data-driven model for evaluating household carbon footprint in China based on a nationwide questionnaire survey. Employing explainable machine learning, we identified the most influential features impacting the model outputs, which were utilized to assess household carbon footprints across Chinese provinces and cities from 2006 to 2021. Additionally, we constructed 27 scenarios with varying peak carbon times, technological evolution pathways, and cumulative carbon budgets to analyze climate change mitigation options for policymakers. The results demonstrate that using the XGBoost-TPE method, the model constructed with only five pivotal features achieves a confidence level of 87.4%. From 2006 to 2021, China's provinces exhibited fluctuating growth trends in household carbon footprints, with economically developed and eastern regions demonstrating higher per capita household carbon footprints. Scenario modelling reveals that combining multiple moderate scenarios yields a 26% increase in effectiveness compared to a single scenario. Promoting low-carbon household food, energy, and transport policies earlier or more aggressively can result in an earlier peak in household carbon footprints and a 2.5% greater carbon reduction.

KW  - Life cycle assessment
KW  - Sustainability of water use
AB  - Climate change has become a global threat and a cause of uncertainty for numerous economic sectors, particularly agriculture. Several studies addressing the impacts of climate change can be found in the literature; however, studies on strategies to improve sustainability in orchards are scarce. Bananas are of great economic importance in tropical regions, and their production is characterized by high consumption of natural resources, increasing greenhouse gas emissions and environmental impacts. This study aimed to identify critical points in banana production, understand how they influence future footprints, and develop strategies to reduce current footprints. Life cycle assessment was used to estimate water scarcity (ISO 14046) and carbon (ISO 14067) footprints. Results are presented per 1 kg of banana. Primary data from 10-year averages were collected from farms located in the Lower Jaguaribe sub-basin. The results revealed that the carbon footprint ranged from 0.21 to 0.84 kg CO2 eq kg−1 in 2023, whereas the water scarcity footprint reached 1441 m3 eq kg−1. Under the current scenario, yield improvement could reduce carbon footprint by up to 57.9%, and greater efficiency in water use could decrease water footprint by up to 77%. In 2055, projections suggest that improvements in irrigation could lead to reductions of 5% in carbon footprint and 24.9% in water scarcity footprint. The findings of this study highlight the importance of adopting a sustainable approach to banana production, emphasizing the need to improve natural resource management and promote conscious agricultural practices, such as no-till farming and polyculture, which favor carbon sequestration. The use of plants that perform biological nitrogen fixation can reduce the need for nitrogen fertilizers, in alignment with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Public policies focused on providing technical assistance to farmers are crucial for achieving environmentally sustainable production and enhancing resilience to climate change and water scarcity.

AB  - Intelligent chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs) have recently been sweeping the world, with potential for a wide variety of industrial applications. Global frontier technology companies are feverishly participating in LLM-powered chatbot design and development, providing several alternatives beyond the famous ChatGPT. However, training, fine-tuning, and updating such intelligent chatbots consume substantial amounts of electricity, resulting in significant carbon emissions. The research and development of all intelligent LLMs and software, hardware manufacturing (e.g., graphics processing units and supercomputers), related data/operations management, and material recycling supporting chatbot services are associated with carbon emissions to varying extents. Attention should therefore be paid to the entire life-cycle energy and carbon footprints of LLM-powered intelligent chatbots in both the present and future in order to mitigate their climate change impact. In this work, we clarify and highlight the energy consumption and carbon emission implications of eight main phases throughout the life cycle of the development of such intelligent chatbots. Based on a life-cycle and interaction analysis of these phases, we propose a system-level solution with three strategic pathways to optimize the management of this industry and mitigate the related footprints. While anticipating the enormous potential of this advanced technology and its products, we make an appeal for a rethinking of the mitigation pathways and strategies of the life-cycle energy usage and carbon emissions of the LLM-powered intelligent chatbot industry and a reshaping of their energy and environmental implications at this early stage of development.

AB  - Purpose
Achieving net-zero emissions in the maritime sector requires adopting carbon-neutral practices in terms of shipbuilding, operation and recycling. However, research integrating life cycle and energy analysis is missing to inform decision-makers.
Method
Consequently, the paper presents models combining a model-based life cycle assessment (MBLCA) and ship energy simulations to examine the footprints of a generic New Panamax Containership (DTC). Analyses were conducted to assess the energy and carbon effects of using synthetic methanol as marine fuel.
Results
The life-cycle analysis confirms the overwhelming prevalence of operations in the total greenhouse gases emission during the ship's lifetime. The analysis highlights the potential of carbon savings if the vessel consumes methanol produced from neutral energy and renewable carbon sources. However, the magnitude of shipping fuel requirements may profoundly impact energy infrastructures while still requiring large volumes of carbon offset credits.
Conclusion
The paper confirms the usefulness of integrating life-cycle analysis and energy modelling to discuss future energy scenarios. The completeness of the models also allows for future research analysing other energy solutions.

AB  - The carbon footprint embodied in international population mobility has a complex spatial correlation, which exacerbates the difficulty of global climate governance. However, the features, changing trends, and determinants of the carbon footprint flow embodied in global population migration are poorly understood. This study employed social network analysis and the exponential random graph model (ERGM) to investigate the structural changes and drivers of the carbon footprint network embodied in global migration from 1995 to 2015. The results showed that approximately 50% of carbon footprint flow embodied in international migration flowed from developing to developed countries. The spatial connections between countries in the network were becoming increasingly close, displaying a typical small-world structure, and showing low reciprocity and negative assortativity. Moreover, centrality analysis highlighted the United States and the European Union as being at the core of the network, whereas some emerging economies (e.g., China, India, and South Africa) were shown as having an increasing influence on the network. The determinants of network formation were divided into three effects. For node attribute effect, countries with developed economy, high proportion of industrial value added, urbanization and openness were becoming the destinations of carbon inflows from immigrants, while countries with high consumption of renewable energy and energy intensity had a trend of carbon outflows with emigrants over periods. As for exogenous network effect, the significance of economic integration on the formation of the network was strengthening, while that of geographical proximity and cultural similarity was declining. Additionally, the positive impact of self-organizational effect on the network was decreasing. This study provided guidance for countries to formulate policies to reduce the carbon emissions embodied in international migration.

AB  - As an indispensable component and intermediate bridge, electrochemical battery as an indispensable component is essential for power supply reliability, stability, grid-friendly interaction, sustainability with e-transportation and building electrification. However, the lifecycle carbon intensity of electrochemical batteries is uncertain throughout lifecycle battery-related activities. In this study, a generic methodology is proposed to accurately quantify the lifecycle carbon intensity of electrochemical batteries. A cross-scale multi-stage analytic platform with inter-disciplinary and trans-disciplinary is formulated, involving battery materials (anode, cathode, electrolyte), charging/discharging behaviours, cascade battery utilization, recycling, and reproduction. A case study on a zero-energy district in subtropical Guangzhou indicates that lifetime EV battery carbon intensity is +556 kg CO2,eq/kWh for the scenario with pure fossil fuel-based grid reliance, while the minimum carbon intensity of EVs at −860 kg CO2,eq/kWh can be achieved for the solar-wind supported scenario. The grid mandatory EVs charging will slightly increase the battery carbon intensity to −617.2 kg CO2,eq/kWh, and the exclusion of embodied carbon on both solar PV and wind turbines will increase the battery carbon intensity to −583.8 kg CO2,eq/kWh. The proposed approach and formulated platform can enable synthetical and comprehensive analysis on battery sustainability, throughout integrated cross-disciplinary approaches for 2060 carbon neutrality in China.

AB  - Robotic assembly lines are widely applied in the manufacturing sector to produce a wide range of products because of their efficiency and multifunctionality. The robotic assembly line balancing problem (RALBP) is a combinatorial optimization problem where the decision variables are task assignment and robot allocation. However, RALBP considering carbon footprint, which is a very significant environmental concern, has scarcely been studied in the literature and a practical “cross-station” design is never mathematically formulated. In this paper, a mixed-integer programming model is proposed to optimize the two objectives according to the Pareto principle. A particle swarm algorithm (PSO) with some improvement rules is designed to solve the problem. To examine the efficiency of the algorithm, computational experiments including five medium-sized and five large-sized datasets are conducted. The results show that the efficiency of PSO is better than that of four other classic algorithms in terms of three evaluation metrics. Further, the production manager and assembly line designer can choose the appropriate production plan and upgrade the line configuration.

AB  - With population growth, industrial expansion, and increased energy demand intensifying pollution, Morocco is suffering from a shortage of fossil fuels, urgently calling for climate intervention to stimulate the imperative reduction of its carbon footprint. Indeed, the country has realized that it is time to monitor its environmental indicators such as energy consumption, accounting, and carbon footprint to comply with global efforts to reduce carbon footprint and aim for energy efficiency while preserving and optimizing its energy resources. Much attention has been focused on the transportation sector, the second-largest global polluter, which will be the subject of our analysis. Our case study will focus on the evaluation of three vehicles to examine the influence of driver behavior on energy consumption and carbon footprint. Data collection was carried out using UPLOGISTIX, a solution developed by our hosting entity, which aims to present calculations of environmental measures to display the results and ultimately provide recommendations for reducing its carbon footprint. An approach has been proposed to achieve the set objectives. The results of our analysis highlight the existence of a significant relationship between behavioral barriers and energy consumption. Indeed, the behavior of a reckless driver, characterized by abrupt braking, rapid accelerations, and other factors, leads to an actual energy consumption that exceeds recommended standards. This excessive consumption results in a considerable production of CO2 emissions.

AB  - Industrial development in Ethiopia is rapidly increasing, leading to a growing gap between energy supply and demand. To address this, efficient energy utilization in existing industries is crucial. Energy audits identify energy losses and recommend saving measures. Therefore, this study evaluates energy efficiency through an audit and estimates greenhouse gas emissions for a Meta Abo brewery. The indirect method of energy audit and the greenhouse gas protocol of carbon footprint estimation were used to evaluate the energy efficiency and carbon emissions of Meta Abo brewery. The boiler efficiency for Bono Energia and Cochran boilers was found to be 79.2% and 80.9%, respectively. Poor insulation caused an estimated annual fuel loss of 35,350 l (638,768 Ethiopian birr) for steam pipes, while steam leakage resulted in a loss of 31,614 l (571,265 Ethiopian birr). The factory's high electricity expense was attributed to a diesel generator consuming 6000 l/d. Greenhouse gas emissions raised from 9156 to 22,697 tons of CO2 equivalent between 2014 and 2018. Implementing the proposed energy-saving measures could save 20.4 TJ of thermal and electrical energy annually, costing approximately 8.5 million Ethiopian birr, and reduce boiler emissions by 455 tons of CO2 equivalent. Therefore, implementation of these measures is recommended.

AB  - The transition to sustainable diet has mitigated climate risks and improved human health. With the rapidly increasing demand for food and high carbon mitigation pressure, food consumption in rural China has emerged as a pivotal factor in the transition process. Although diet-related carbon footprint (DCF) has been widely discussed worldwide, little is known about intra-group differences in DCFs, particularly in rural regions. Additionally, a sustainable transition pathway is unclear because of the trade-offs between DCF, nutritional quality, and affordability. In this study, inequality in intra-rural food consumption and the associated carbon footprints of different food categories were revealed based on the latest and most updated social household survey data. Future transition pathways encompassing DCFs, affordability, and nutrition were comprehensively considered. The results revealed stark intragroup differences in the DCF of rural residents, and the consumption of animal-based food exhibited a more pronounced level of inequality than plant-based food. Compared with other groups, high-income households had a higher per capita DCF, larger emission share from animal-based food, and lower share from plant-based food. Based on future sustainable transition analysis, fully adopting optimized dietary patterns can reduce the DCF by 2.28–48.84% and improve nutritional quality, especially in low-income populations (16.98–38.62%). However, regardless of the transition pathway, affordability for low-income groups needs to be considered, which may hinder sustainable transitions in the future. Our study has implications for sustainable dietary transitions in rural areas, which will bring co-benefits to both humans and the environment.

AB  - Since palm oil products have a crucial role in society development, palm oil business in Indonesia has grown significantly over the past few decades. However, this industry is frequently linked to environmental issues, particularly its potential emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs). This study attempts to estimate the carbon footprint of a palm oil company's operation for the year of 2030. In doing so, a novel methodology that consists of organizational lifecycle assessment (O-LCA), simple linear regression (SLR), and double exponential smoothing (DES) methods is proposed. O-LCA is used to identify the sources of emission and estimate the amount of the emission generated, while SLR and DES are used to forecast the sources. As the result, the carbon footprint in 2030 is estimated to be 62,758,433.56 kg Carbon Dioxide equivalent (CO2eq) where on average a ton of crude palm oil (CPO) produces 1.08 ton CO2eq. The study also discloses that the three largest emission sources are palm oil mill effluent (POME), fertilizer, and transportation. The forecasting methods used are quite accurate with mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of less than 10%. The results of this study can shed a light to help Indonesia achieving its target to reduce GHG emission by 2030.

AB  - Eddy covariance (EC) is a common approach for observing evapotranspiration (ET). In the EC system, there is a varying flux footprint climatology which causes a spatial mismatch between the forcing data from the ET model and EC observations, generating extra errors in estimating ET. This study endeavored to reduce the error caused by the spatial scale inconsistency between forcing data and ET measurements employing joint observations from EC system, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and satellites under the flux footprint theory and the Penman-Monteith (P-M) model. The joint observations were performed in 2020 at the LuanCheng (LES) and YuCheng (YES) sites. Surface conductance for the varying flux footprint climatology was retrieved from EC observations using the inverted P-M model. The vegetation indices from various remote sensing platforms, including UAV, MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2, were retrieved and employed to evaluate surface conductance and ET within the flux footprint climatology. The findings indicated that varying flux footprint climatology had a significant impact on the accuracy of ET estimation. The UAV, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2 data all generated good ET estimations (LES: R2 > 0.72, RMSE < 0.81 mm day−1; YES: R2 > 0.74, RMSE < 0.91 mm day−1) in the 80 % and 90 % flux footprint climatology. In contrast, MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2 obtained worse ET performance at LES (R2 < 0.65, RMSE > 0.88 mm day−1) and YES (R2 < 0.67, RMSE > 0.90 mm day−1) when flux footprint climatology was disregarded. Among the four remote sensing platforms, UAV remote sensing images integrated with the flux footprint model significantly enhanced the accuracy of ET estimation (LES: R2 = 0.83, RMSE = 0.66 mm day−1; YES: R2 = 0.84, RMSE = 0.55 mm day−1). This study demonstrated that considering flux footprint climatology can acquire accurate ET estimates.

A contribution of the work is demonstrating that these two operations have the lowest reported GHG global emissions per unit production of lithium carbonate and of lithium hydroxide, and that this is possible due to natural and anthropogenic characteristics. Another contribution is that the natural advantages of the Atacama deposit should remain crucial in this leadership in spite of the introduction of an assortment of technologies in the reduction of GHG emissions in the future. A third contribution is showing that the largest cause of the carbon footprint for lithium carbonate production at the Atacama Salt Flat was soda ash, with 63.1 % of the total.

AB  - Energy and carbon (C) footprints of agricultural production practices have garnered high attention due to rising energy costs and increasing global warming. However, the contribution of conservation and regenerative farming practices, including cover cropping, on energy and C footprints have not yet been documented for cropping systems in arid and semi-arid regions. This study evaluated the energy and C footprint of cover crop integrated silage maize (Zea mays L.) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) production systems in the semi-arid region of the southwestern US. The treatments were mixtures of winter cover crops: i) grasses and legumes (GL), ii) grasses, brassicas, and legumes (GBL), iii) grasses and brassicas (GB), and iv) no cover crops (NCC) control for each crop production system. Results showed cover crops had 24.1–24.5% greater energy input than NCC. In silage maize rotation, energy output was 17–22% greater in GBL and GL than in NCC. In silage sorghum rotation, the energy output was 15–24% greater in all cover crops than in NCC. The resulting net energy was 16–21% greater in GBL and GL than in NCC under silage maize, while it was 18–24% greater in GBL and GB than in NCC under silage sorghum. In the silage maize system, the C-footprint per kg yield was not different among treatments, whereas in silage sorghum, it was 58% greater in GBL than in NCC. The benefit-to-cost ratio was greater than one for all treatments, but the additional revenue through C credit programs could make cover cropping a more feasible and beneficial approach, improving economic and environmental sustainability while producing silage crops. While the C footprint was crop rotation specific, cover cropping should be encouraged over crop-fallow systems to producers in semi-arid environments to reduce energy usage and increase C-credit benefits. Clear national and state policy on the C credit program will also enhance economic and environmental benefits by adopting cover cropping and other regenerative farming practices.

AB  - On the way to climate neutrality manufacturing companies need to assess the Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of their products as a basis for emission reduction measures. The evaluate this so-called Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) life cycle analysis as a comprehensive method is applicable, but means great effort and requires interdisciplinary knowledge. Nevertheless, assumptions must still be made to assess the entire supply chain. To lower these burdens and provide a digital tool to estimate the PCF with less input parameter and data, we make use of machine learning techniques and develop an editorial framework called MINDFUL. This contribution shows its realization by providing the software architecture, underlying CO2 factors, calculations and Machine Learning approach as well as the principles of its user experience. Our tool is validated within an industrial case study.

The 20 years panel data collected for these countries was analyzed through “auto-regressive distributed lag” (ARDL). Findings of this study reveal that human capital is a significant positive determinant of environmental degradation in short run and long run while renewable energy consumption is a significant negative determinant of environmental degradation in short run and long run. Findings further reveal that globalization significantly reduces environmental degradation in short run and long run. Furthermore, findings show that the financial development significantly positively affects the environmental degradation in short run and long run. Therefore, renewable energy consumption and globalization are found to be negative predictors of ecological footprint and carbon footprint while human capital and financial development are found to be positive predictors of ecological footprint and carbon footprint. These findings are expected to be great contribution to the literature and practice, as they will help researchers and policymakers to realize the relative importance of energy, educational, economic, and trade policies in determining the environmental degradation.

AB  - Prefabricated buildings have gained significant attention as a solution for reducing carbon footprint in the construction industry. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive accounting approach tailored to the construction features of prefabricated buildings. To address this issue, this study develops a framework to account the life-cycle carbon footprint of prefabricated buildings within the circular economy principles. The developed framework is applied to a prefabricated building in Chengdu, China, revealing that a significant carbon footprint is attributed to the material production and transportation stages. Moreover, an uncertainty analysis is conducted based on Data Quality Indicator evaluation method and Monte Carlo Simulation to validate the accounting framework, and a minor deviation of 0.085 % between the uncertain and calculated values validates the proposed accounting framework. Furthermore, key processes to mitigate the carbon footprint are identified. The results show that cast-in-place concrete is a key process at the construction materials level. Building upon these findings, this study offers recommendations on accurately and efficiently accounting the carbon footprint of prefabricated buildings. The research findings contribute to fostering the accounting of the life-cycle carbon footprint for prefabricated buildings, establishing a theoretical and empirical basis for circular economy implementation in prefabricated buildings, and offering insights for making informed carbon emission reduction decisions in prefabricated buildings.

AB  - Traditional climate strategies focus on long-term emissions targets, neglecting cumulative CO2 emissions and often limiting their scope to territorial emissions. Additionally, individual citizens struggle to connect with community targets. This study addresses these issues by computing a comprehensive carbon footprint pathway that, as a main contribution, can be easily personalized and associated with common carbon footprint calculators. This approach innovatively leverages inverted “S-shaped” patterns based on logistic functions that, unlike common linear patterns, have been documented as relevant for diffusion mechanisms of social or ecological transformations. One challenge lies in efficiently aligning the carbon footprint figures, expressed in CO2eq, with IPCC's +2 °C carbon budgets, expressed in CO2-only. This work first retrieves the current share of CO2-only footprint and then defines two mitigation pathways: one focusing solely on CO2 emissions and one addressing residual GHGs. Except for initial and final emission levels, both targeted pathways are defined by the same logistic function, based on the assumed intrinsic link between CO2 and the other GHGs. As final targets, the CO2-only pathway considers the common net-zero emission goal while the second pathway considers a level of 1 tCO2eq/year per capita of unmitigated non-CO2 emissions, in alignment with IPCC's latest assumptions and anticipated population growth. Besides the new +2 °C compatible suggested pathways, developing this method for France and Wallonia has also revealed that they should reach territorial (nature-based) carbon uptake of at least three times their current levels, necessitating deep land-use changes in their policies (implementing intensive urban vegetation, alternative agriculture techniques, etc).

AB  - This study examines the impact of the carbon footprint of bank loans (CFBL) and fossil fuel subsidies (TFFS) on the ecological footprint of Tunisia using a linear and nonlinear ARDL framework. The study found that a 1% increase in CFBL is associated with a 0.15% increase in ecological footprint, whereas a 1% increase in TFFS is correlated with a 0.80% increase in ecological footprint. This suggests that fossil fuel subsidies have a larger detrimental impact on the ecological footprint compared to CFBL. The results provide evidence of an asymmetric relationship between CFBL, TFFS, and ecological footprints. Specifically, CFBL has a significant positive association with ecological footprint, with a 1% increase in CFBL associated with a 0.01% increase in ecological footprint, while a 1% decrease in CFBL results in a 0.002% increase in ecological footprint. TFFS has a more pronounced impact on ecological footprint, with a 1% increase associated with a 0.14% decrease and a 1% decrease associated with a 0.30% decrease, which is twice as large. The findings suggest that positive shocks in environmental taxation lead to a 0.54% decrease in ecological footprints, while negative shocks have a profoundly detrimental effect with a 1.33% increase in ecological footprints. Additionally, the interaction effect indicates that the effectiveness of CFBL and TFFS on ecological footprints is contingent on the level of environmental tax. The result shows that with a 1% increase in environmental tax, the negative impact of CFBL and TFFS on ecological footprints decreases by 0.02% and 0.09%, respectively. These findings underscore the importance of reducing carbon emissions and fossil fuel subsidies and implementing effective environmental taxation policies to promote sustainability and mitigate environmental damage.

AB  - The carbon footprint is an important indicator of the effects of climate change and thus a new control variable for the design and production of new products. A prerequisite for managing and controlling the carbon footprint is calculating and visualizing it transparently. In this work, a general framework for live estimating the carbon footprint for production processes is presented. The framework is used to investigate the carbon footprint of additively manufactured components. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in the straightforwardness of the general framework with a holistic data model. With this it is possible to compare different Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) methods and assumptions of new additively manufactured parts, as all data and methods are integrated from data acquisition at the machine to balancing compactly. A demonstrator is developed that calculates the consumption of energy and materials in real-time. The demonstrator consists of a AM machine, sensors for measuring all consumption, data processing in the back end, and a user-friendly dashboard in the front end. Due to different assumptions and calculation methods, there is a high variation in the final result of the carbon footprint calculation, which is presented in this paper.

AB  - The annual global greenhouse gas emissions are predicted to increase by 124% in 2030, higher than what is required to decrease the global temperature. China is the leading source of carbon emissions related to consumption and has become the focal point of worldwide efforts to lower carbon emissions. Using applications that monitor individual consumption and offer emissions reports will aid consumers in effectively controlling and mitigating their carbon footprint. There is a dearth of consumer understanding regarding the consequences of their everyday consumption-related carbon emissions. This paper uses Shanghai as the study area to assess the variables that encourage consumers to use carbon footprint monitoring applications in China. The integrated technology acceptance model (TAM) and theory of planned behaviour (TPB) were expanded to include personal innovativeness and incentive policies to achieve this aim. In total, 571 responses to legitimate questionnaires were collected. An empirical assessment was conducted using a structural equation modeling to examine the variables impacting consumers' usage of carbon footprint monitoring applications. The results suggest that personal innovativeness, incentive policies, attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease-of-use influence consumers' usage of carbon footprint monitoring applications positively and significantly. The research outcomes provide complete insight into consumer behaviour concerning adopting carbon footprint tracking apps. Besides, the study offers policy implications for decision-makers and potential stakeholders.

AB  - Aim
The main objective of this study was to estimate the carbon impact of arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs in France. The secondary objective was to assess the effectiveness of the following measures in reducing the carbon footprint associated with this technique: outpatient treatment, arthroscopic water filtration, surgery under locoregional anesthesia.
Hypothesis
The hypothesis was that the carbon footprint could be significantly improved with the implementation of these three procedures.
Methods
A continuous series of 26 patients who underwent surgery for a rotator cuff tear involving only one tendon between November 2020 and April 2021 were included. The evaluation protocol consisted of three parts: 1/ use of volatile anesthetic agents; 2/ electrical consumption linked to the procedure; 3/ emissions related to patient and staff travel, delivery of implants and waste management. Another series of 26 patients operated between November 2018 and April 2019 who had none of these three factors were matched.
Results
The carbon impact of arthroscopic repair of the rotator cuff was estimated at 334.61±18.82kgCO2eq. The implementation of the three methods for improvement made it possible to significantly reduce emissions by 40.9±1.71kgCO2eq (12.2%) (p<0.001).
Conclusion
Performing surgery under locoregional anesthesia, on an outpatient basis with water purification, reduces the carbon impact of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair by more than 12%.
Level of evidence
III, retrospective case control.

AB  - Although the estimation of the elasticity of the household carbon footprint and income is a frequently analysed fact, unfortunately a fundamental aspect of this relationship has not been considered: it is not a constant factor for the whole population. To make an adequate estimate of this relationship, a Quantile Regression is proposed, obtaining significantly different results to those derived from the usual estimations using ordinary least squares (OLS), which have been carried out up to now. This fact is fundamental for the correct planning and evaluation of fiscal policies based on income taxation to reduce the carbon footprint. Our results confirm that the OLS estimation would overestimate the effects of income on CO2 reduction by 26%.
