AB  - Pallets play a critical role in supply chains across a variety of industries in the world, since they are used for holding items during transportation and in transit. Pallets can be constructed using different materials and assembled in various designs to satisfy their functional requirements. Currently, material selection is predominantly based on material performance and cost analysis. Nonetheless, it is important to evaluate the suitability of the material in terms of an environmental footprint to reduce emissions generation. This study performed an environmental footprint assessment for the two most common packaging materials - wood and plastic, complying with GHG Protocol standards, in the Australian context. A quantitative analysis was carried out based on empirical data obtained from an Australian wooden pallet manufacturer (WPM) and published data for plastic pallets. Results demonstrated the carbon footprint of the plastic pallets (216 kgCO2-e) to complete 100 trips is 1.5 times higher than the wooden pallets (144 kgCO2-e), from a cradle-to-grave perspective. Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis was also conducted to identify sensitive variables and assess the accuracy of the results. Findings of this study can assist industry practitioners, academia, and policy enablers in selecting suitable materials to achieve emissions reduction.

AB  - A number of studies have estimated the carbon footprint of healthcare provision in a variety of contexts, but the emission factors used to account for associated waste vary widely and are not healthcare specific. The aim of this study was to estimate and compare the carbon footprint of hospital waste streams. A process-based carbon footprint of hospital waste was estimated in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Accounting Sector Guidance for Pharmaceutical Products and Medical Devices, using activity data based on waste streams found at three hospitals in one UK National Health Service organisation. This study estimates that the carbon footprint per t of hospital waste was lowest when it is recycled (21–65 kg CO2e), followed by low temperature incineration with energy from waste (172–249 kg CO2e). When the waste was additionally decontaminated using an autoclave prior to low temperature incineration with energy from waste, the carbon footprint was increased to 569 kg CO2e. The highest carbon footprint was associated with the disposal of waste via high temperature incineration (1074 kg CO2e/ t). NHS data show that the financial cost of waste streams mirror that of the carbon footprint. In conclusion, it is possible to use the carbon footprint of hospital waste streams to derive emission factors for specific waste disposal options. This may inform the optimal processing of healthcare waste in the future.

AB  - For mitigating climate change and respect targets, humanity must decrease emissions as soon as possible: the later is the action, the harsher will be the trajectory of the mitigating pathway. Structural actions need time to become operational. Therefore, individual actions shall also enter into play, focusing on what has a high impact and whose change is at hand: food-related emissions build up 30% of total anthropogenic impacts and eating is an everyday activity. In this study, regional culturally acceptable low-carbon diets are proposed for China, Europe and US. They are developed considering the requirements of energy and nutrients supply, they respect regionality of food consumption – e.g., they include only foods that are diffused in the area – and they are aimed to limit the individual effort to be adopted – e.g., they include all the food categories, meat included. They are low-carbon since food items are selected on the basis of their lifecycle carbon footprint (CF). Eventually, the regionality constraints are relaxed to develop a World's low-carbon diet. For every area, we found a diet that halves the food-related CF. Instead, our World's low-carbon diet reduces the average food-related CF by 75%. Therefore, the overall individual CF would be reduced by a fifth in case of its adoption.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to construct a digital tool and design process for building a carbon footprint calculation to change the current status of Taiwan's carbon footprint calculation in post-use assessment, and to incorporate both carbon emissions and energy consumption in the environmental impact assessment into the initial considerations of the architectural design. Through the connection of carbon emission calculation tools and optimization tools, the advantages and disadvantages of multiple schemes in relation to carbon emissions and energy consumption can be compared simultaneously, thereby assisting designers to achieve faster results when making design decisions. In addition to the building's area, orientation, and height, various schemes could also further facilitate architectural design plans with lower carbon emissions by adjusting factors such as the external shading depth and the window-to-wall ratio by calculating the building dimensions to pursue the maximum percentage of the visual field (maximum window area), thereby reducing carbon emissions. This study is expected to meet the needs of users by simplifying the calculation tools and operation interface required for carbon emission calculations, visualizing the calculation results, and enabling a comparison of multiple design schemes. In addition, it provides recommended projects that can be reviewed in the early decision-making stage of the architectural design process, and provides designers and planners with approximate building carbon emission calculations for projects. Furthermore, to facilitate a calculation process with the best view, the scheme simulation is optimized under the existing design conditions, and the optimal solution (Pareto optimal solution) is obtained following calculation classification and analysis. The simulated data can be listed for design reference, whereby users can make design decisions based on the design conditions.

AB  - Purpose
During the planting process, agricultural products produce large amounts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This has placed tremendous pressure on sustainable global development. Many countries and regions in the world have adopted intensive subsistence cultivation methods when planting maize; however, limited studies exist on these methods. The main purpose of this research is to show the impact of climate change on maize yields and carbon footprint (CF) in South Korea over 10 years, find the proper operating method and promote the advanced combination of inputs for the sustainable development of maize farmers.
Design/methodology/approach
This study used survey data from the South Korea Rural Development Administration of 2010, 2014 and 2019 to estimate the CF of maize planting under intensive subsistence cultivation. Life-cycle assessment was used to determine the CF. Farmers were grouped according to significant differences in yield and GHG emissions. Linear regression was used to measure the dependence of the main contributors on the CF production and carbon efficiency.
Findings
In South Korean maize planting, N in chemical fertiliser was the most significant contributor to the CF and organic fertiliser was the most significant input. The use of chemical and organic fertilisers significantly affects the production of the CF and carbon efficiency. Households in the high-yield and low-GHG emission groups are more sustainable because they generate the least GHG when producing and earning through maize cultivation. Globally, maize production in South Korea has a relatively low CF and maize production produces fewer GHG.
Originality/value
This study provides information for policymakers to determine key operational options for reducing GHG emissions using intensive subsistence cultivation of maize production in South Korea and other countries.

AB  - The aim of this experiment was to determine the optimal ratio between maize silage and grass-clover silage in lactating dairy cow diets. The evaluation was based on nutrient digestibility, rumen metabolism and total carbon footprint (CF). Carbon footprint included enteric methane emission and CF from feed production, transportation, processing, and C sequestration in the soil, based on a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach. Four diets varying in proportions of grass-clover silage and maize silage (100:0, 67:33, 33:67, and 0:100 on dry matter (DM) basis, respectively) were fed ad libitum to 4 lactating Holstein cows (a fifth cow was involved later in the study) fitted with ruminal, duodenal, and ileal canulae in a 4 × 4 Latin square design. Nutrient digestibility was measured using chromium oxide and titanium oxide as flow markers, and methane and CO2 emissions were measured in open-circuit respiration chambers on 5 consecutive days for each cow in each period. Data were analyzed with treatment and period as fixed effects and cow as random effect. DM intake (DMI) increased linearly (P = 0.01) with increased proportion of maize silage in the feed ration. Under the conditions in the present study, diets had only minor effects on digestibility of nutrients and there was no influence on rumen pH. Total VFA concentration decreased linearly with increased level of maize silage, but there were only minor effects on molar proportions of VFAs in the rumen. However, there was a linear increase in duodenal flow of microbial DM with increasing level of maize silage. The cows produced 30.7, 29.4. 28.4, and 26.2 L of methane/kg of DMI on diets 100:0, 66:33, 33:66, and 0:100, respectively (P = 0.02 for linear effect), which is equivalent to a 15% decrease, when all grass-clover silage was replaced by maize silage. Despite the significant reduction in enteric methane emission with increased proportion of maize silage, only a 4% decrease in total CF per kg DMI was found, when including CF from feed production, transportation, processing, manure, energy use and C sequestration in the soil, when using a LCA approach. If direct Land Use Change (LUC) or indirect LUC was included in estimation of CF, the reduction in CF when replacing all grass-clover silage was also 4–6%. However, the total CF was highly dependent on assumptions related to yield of grass-clover and maize.

AB  - The carbon footprint of households is a significant contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for 24% of total emissions. As a result, it is critical to quantify a household's carbon footprint in order to reduce it over time. One of the best ways to measure carbon emitted from various sectors of the economy, including household daily activities, is to calculate a country's carbon footprint (CF). This study statistically examined the magnitude of households' carbon footprints and their relationships with household daily activities and certain socio-economic demographic variables in Malaysia. Results revealed that the average household carbon footprint amounted to 11.76 t-CO2. The average also showed that the primary carbon footprint, 7.02 t-CO2 or 59.69% was higher compared to the secondary carbon footprint which was 4.73 t- CO2 or 40.22% and assessment revealed significant differences among household types. The largest carbon footprint was evident in a medium-high cost urban area, estimated at 20.14 t-CO2, while the carbon footprint found in a rural area was 9.58 t-CO2. In the latter, the primary carbon footprint was almost double the figure of 5.84 t-CO2 (61%) than the secondary carbon footprint of 3.73 t-CO2 (39%). The study reveals a higher carbon footprint in urban areas compared to rural ones depicting the effects of urbanisation and urban sprawl on household lifestyles and carbon footprints. Despite some limitations, the findings of this study will help policymakers design and implement stronger policies that enforce low-carbon activities and energy-saving goods and services in order to reduce urban Malaysia's carbon footprint dramatically.

AB  - The OECD community consumes excessive amounts of raw materials and materials, which leads to pollution and increases the material footprint. The material footprint is directly linked to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)-8 and 12. The main reason for the material footprint is the usage of fossil fuels, and the dependence of OECD countries on fossil fuels continues to this day. By expanding renewable energy utilization due to rising energy security risk, a community can take steps to improve ecological quality and reduce its material footprint. In this context, the paper focuses to examine the impact of energy security, green innovation, economic policy stringency and income on the fossil fuel material footprint for 24 OECD countries over the period 1995–2018. To this end, the paper uses the Augmented Mean Group (AMG) method and novel Half Panel Jackknife (HPJ) causality and estimation approach. The study adds value to existing knowledge by empirically testing the determinants of fossil fuel material footprint for OECD countries for the first time using the novel HPJ approach. The results of the AMG show that increasing energy security risk index reduces the material footprint, while green innovation and economic policy stringency have no impact on environmental degradation. The environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) in the form of an inverted U and an inverted N are valid for OECD countries. The HPJ approach also illustrates that there is a causality from green innovation and energy security risk to material footprint, and innovation and risk are support footprint reduction. Based on these results, the study recommends that OECD policymakers pay attention to ensuring energy security to reduce the material footprint by expanding renewable resources and allocate more economic resources to green innovations with higher returns, considering the validity of the EKC.

AB  - This study examines the determinants of the ecological footprint of production in European countries from 1992 to 2020. Using partial and semipartial correlation analyses and Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) approach for the first time, the research identifies key variables affecting ecological footprint. Using Bayesian methods, posterior inclusion probabilities (PIPs) were calculated for each variable's coefficient estimates, revealing their relative importance. Biocapacity, energy consumption, industrialization, financial development, life expectancy, and globalization displayed notably high PIPs, indicating their strong influence on the ecological footprint. In addition, the study employs cointegration tests to examine the long-run relationship between ecological footprint and explanatory variables. The results indicate significant cointegration between these variables across panels, supported by various test statistics. In the Weighted Pooled DOLS estimation, biocapacity, energy consumption, and life expectancy significantly influence the ecological footprint, while industrialization, financial development, and globalization exert a comparatively smaller impact. Researchers and policymakers should consider these determinants for effective sustainable development planning. These findings underscore the intricate interplay of factors shaping the ecological footprint and offer insights for effective policy interventions towards sustainable development.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Droughts, which can affect feed production, are projected to become more common under future climate conditions. In light of this, breeding cattle resilient to changes in feeding regimens is increasingly becoming an important topic. Body reserves can play a crucial role when feed resources are limited. We simulated populations of dairy cows selected with 2 different breeding goals: one reflecting the current breeding goal and the other placing weight on minimum level of body reserves in early lactation and change in body reserves during lactation. We considered this latter as a breeding goal for resilience. We used the 2 dynamic simulation programs ADAM and AQAL to predict performance of the cows after selection. In AQAL, we modeled moderate and severe drought by decreasing feed quality and quantity offered to cows during one year. We compared cows selected with the 2 breeding goals under 3 environments: without disturbances related to climate and with moderate and severe drought. In the environments without disturbances and the moderate drought, the cows selected with the current breeding goal had higher lifetime lactation efficiency (energy invested in milk/energy acquired from feed) and lower carbon footprint per kilogram of protein in milk and meat than cows selected for resilience. However, with severe drought, cows selected for resilience had higher lifetime lactation efficiency and lower carbon footprint per kilogram of protein in milk and meat than those selected with the current breeding goal. This suggests that cows selected for high productive performance do not perform well under very limiting conditions, leading to increased climate impact. The importance of inclusion of body reserves as a resilience trait in dairy cattle breeding depends on the future environment in which the cows will be used.

AB  - Energy production from biomass is very strategic for the achievement of global sustainability goals and the use of biofuels for decentralized energy production in medium-small size plants, which conforms to global fossil energy and GHG reduction targets, is expected to increase in the short-medium term. This paper proposes a simplified methodology for estimating the Carbon Footprint associated with heat generation by forest woodchips. The methodology includes all the relevant life cycle phases and is based on the specific fuel and plant characteristics, so it can effectively support sustainability assessment in decision-making regarding biomass projects through proper Carbon Footprint estimates. The application of the methodology showed results in the range of about 6–12 gCO2eq/MJ, depending on the case study characteristics, that agree with the impact values range observed from previous literature. The basic idea that the use of forest woodchips is particularly strategic for sustainable energy production within a “local” wood-energy supply chain (short transport distance) was confirmed. Furthermore, the methodology allowed to estimate indicative transportation distances for which forest woodchips can be considered environmentally competitive compared to alternative renewable sources such as, for instance, wood pellets.

AB  - The role of a reliable resource consumption measurement is essential for devising a relevant climate policy. The consumption-based material footprint is trade-adjusted domestic resource consumption that presents an accurate picture of the domestic material footprint. Pursuing the same, this study draws asymmetric linkages between infrastructure development, green innovation, and consumption-based material footprint (MF) in the top 11 highly material-consuming countries. Our preliminary findings strictly reject the preposition of data normality and highlight that the observed relationship is quantile-dependent, which may disclose misleading results in previous studies using linear methodologies. In compliance, a novel empirical estimation technique popularized as Method of Moments Quantile Regression is employed that simultaneously deal with non-normality and structural changes in data. The results exhibit that infrastructure development (green innovation) significantly increases (decreases) MF mainly across medium to higher quantiles (medium-higher level of MF). Interestingly, the resource-depleting effect of infrastructure is highest for higher quantiles and lowest for lower quantiles of MF. Economic growth (globalization) increase MF, and their resource-depleting effect is higher (lowest) for lower quantiles and lowest (highest) for higher quantiles. Lastly, population exhibits an inverted-U shape relationship with MF across lower to higher quantiles. These results suggest pertinent policy recommendations.

AB  - Understanding the complex links between socioeconomic variables and carbon emissions can reveal household spending and lifestyle patterns. This study oversees those issues and examines consumption patterns and their related variables such as climate change understanding, attitudes, and knowledge, in order to better comprehend the complicated linkages. This study revealed that eight socioeconomic elements influence a household's carbon footprint: (i) household income (β = 0.476, p < 0.05), (ii) green attitudes (β = −0.196, p < 0.05), (iii) residential space (β = 0.157, p < 0.05), (iv), education levels (β = 0.131, p < 0.05), (v) household's tenure status by ownership (β = 0.130, p < 0.05), (vi) household's age (β = 0.112, p < 0.05), (vii) size of household (β = 0.101, p < 0.05), and, (viii) female-headed household (β = −0.077, p < 0.05). Approximately 83.6% of respondents are mindful of climate change, but only 2.6% correctly define it as a long-term shift in weather patterns. The study found that 82% of households are willing to change their consumption habits and lifestyle to reduce their household's carbon footprint. In order to achieve a low carbon society, our research advocate a multipronged approach and policy action is crucial based on the results. Further, robust climate change educational and awareness programmes is decisive at the multilevel and scale in Malaysia to achieve its carbon emissions reduction target by 2050.

AB  - Early evaluation of carbon capture and utilization (CCU) pathways in terms of cost and emission reductions is critical in guiding future R&D and commercialization. However, such evaluation is challenging due to varying technology readiness levels (TRL) of pathways, unavailability of cost and emission data for new technologies and uncertainty of performance parameters of lab scale technologies. In this study, we propose a standardized methodology that allow comparing synthetic fuel production pathways based on early stage lab scale CO2 electrolysis technologies with mature CCU technologies and incumbent technologies. This methodology provides guidelines for defining pathways, modeling and cost and carbon footprint (CF) assessment supported by a bottom-up framework to scale- up the costs and CF of lab scale technologies. We apply the developed methodology to evaluate Fischer-Tropsh synthesis (FTS) fuel production pathways based on bicarbonate electrolysis, a novel early stage CO2 electroreduction technology with integrated CO2 capture, and reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction, a mature thermocatalytic CO2 conversion technology. The cost of diesel fuel production using RWGS and bicarbonate electrolysis pathways were 1.7 $/L and 1.5 $/L, respectively, which is more than 140% of current cost of diesel. Nevertheless, both pathways were able to achieve significant emissions reductions with bicarbonate electrolysis reducing 90% and RWGS reducing at 70% compared to conventional diesel. Based on the uncertainties of calculated cost, neither pathway is more economically competitive than the other. However bicarbonate electrolysis pathway offer more opportunities for emission reduction as most of its energy demand can be provided by renewable electricity. RWGS pathway with relatively higher thermal energy demand will need to rely on high level of energy recovery and integration to achieve similar emission reductions.

AB  - Crop production is the biggest water user and key contributor to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Increasing crop yields to ensure adequate food supply under water and land scarcity is excessively dependents on intensive agricultural inputs (such as fertilizers, pesticides, agri-films, or energy), resulting in unintended environmental consequences. Supply chains bringing environmental-intensive inputs from their place of production to the croplands. However, most food-related environmental assessments ignore the environmental burden of agricultural input production, trade, and consumption. Here, we estimate spatially-detailed water (WF) and carbon footprints (CF) of wheat, maize, and rice production in China with extended system boundary from upstream raw material mining to the field. The agricultural inputs account for up to 24% and 89% of a crop's WF and CF, respectively, at the provincial level. The total local generated WF in Chinese northern provinces and CF in Shanxi and Inner Mongolia provinces for producing crops and agricultural inputs transgresses the corresponding downscaled blue water and carbon planetary boundaries. The study broadens the scope of traditional environmental impact assessments in agricultural production and sheds light on the significances to manage the linkages between the crop production and the agricultural inputs’ upstream supply chains towards more efficient water use and less greenhouse gas emissions in food system.

AB  - Context
Carbon footprint (CF) has emerged as an important factor when assessing health care interventions.
Objective
To investigate the reduction in CF for patients utilizing telemedicine.
Evidence acquisition
The PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were queried for studies describing telemedicine consultation and reporting on carbon emissions saved and the carbon emissions of telemedicine devices as primary outcomes, and travel distance and time and cost savings and safety as secondary outcomes. Outcomes were tabulated and calculated per consultation. Carbon emissions and travel distances were also calculated for each total study cohort. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale, and the Oxford level of evidence was determined.
Evidence synthesis
A total of 48 studies met the inclusion criteria, covering 68 465 481 telemedicine consultations and savings of 691 825 tons of CO2 emissions and 3 318 464 047 km of travel distance. Carbon assessment was mostly reported as the estimated distance saved using a conversion factor. Medical specialties used telemedicine to connect specialists with patients at home (n = 25) or at a local center (n = 6). Surgical specialties used telemedicine for virtual preoperative assessment (n = 9), follow-up (n = 4), and general consultation (n = 4). The savings per consultation were 21.9–632.17 min and $1.85–$325. More studies focused on the COVID-19 time frame (n = 33) than before the pandemic (n = 15). The studies are limited by calculations, mostly for the travel distance for carbon savings, and appropriate follow-up to analyze the real impact on travel and appointments.
Conclusions
Telemedicine reduces the CF of the health care sector. Expanding the use of telemedicine and educating providers and patients could further decrease CO2 emissions and save both money and time.
Patient summary
We reviewed 48 studies on the use of telemedicine. We found that people used their cars less and saved time and money, as well as CO2 emissions, if they used teleconsultations. Some studies only looked at how much CO2 from driving was saved, so there might be more to learn about the benefits of teleconsultations. The use of online doctor appointments is not only good for our planet but also helps patients in saving time and money. This review is registered on the PROSPERO database for systematic reviews (CRD42023456839).

AB  - The present study aims to examine the impact of minerals, geothermal energy, and technology on the ecological footprint within the top five countries exhibiting the highest ecological footprint. In particular, the study utilizes a panel dataset covering China, the US, India, Brazil, and Japan, spanning the years 1998–2022. The empirical findings indicate that the minerals increase the ecological footprint in the long run. Contrarily, both geothermal energy and technology have the potential to mitigate the ecological footprint in the long run. The aforementioned findings indicate the necessity of reconfiguring the utilization of mineral rent in a manner that enables the revenue derived from minerals to effectively alleviate the ecological footprint. Moreover, it is advisable to formulate strategies aimed at augmenting the utilization of geothermal energy. To plunge the ecological footprint, it is imperative to implement policies that incentivize and facilitate the development and adoption of technological innovations. Overall, the current research suggests that the governments in these sample countries with the highest ecological footprint should formulate policies to effectively manage minerals, promote geothermal energy, and enhance technology innovation for effective utilization of resources.

AB  - Considering the decrease in the fossil-fuel reserves and environmental drawbacks of internal combustion engine (ICE) propelled vehicles, the usage of alternative prime movers such as electric vehicles (EVs) has gained significant potential in the last decades. Battery electric vehicles (BEVs), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are a few currently available examples of vehicle electrification. EVs have zero in-use emissions, however, depending on the region to be operated, well-to-wheel (WTW) emissions need to be considered for a realistic carbon footprint effect considering global warming (GW) analysis. Especially, considering the countries where the usage of renewable energy (RE) sources is extremely limited, such as Kuwait and other GCC countries, the benefit of EVs significantly decreases. Within this perspective in this study, an inclusive CO2 emissions analysis for two passenger segment vehicles with different prime movers are analyzed: ICE and electric motor (EM). Longitudinal vehicle models were developed via MATLAB/Simulink software for both prime mover configurations which are capable of simulating the fuel/energy consumption using Toyota Camry and Lexus UX 300e vehicles. The generated CO2 emissions by the two prime movers were compared using the previously generated Kuwait driving cycle (Kuwait DC). The results indicated that the use of BEVs generated fewer CO2 emissions nearly half the amount of what ICE propelled vehicles generated.

AB  - Background
The food industry emits carbon in the process of producing food. This emission leaves a carbon footprint (CF) that contributes to global warming. Reduction of CF is critical at all food processing steps to support sustainable development goals (SDGs). Generally, the new trend of low-CF food has influenced various aspects, including environmental, economic, and policy aspects.
Scope and approach
The purpose of this work was to explore CF in food processing, focusing on nonthermal technologies for reducing CF, including high-pressure procedures (HPP), pulse electric fields (PEF), cold plasma, low-energy electron beams (LEEB), and another emerging technology that has the potential to reduce CF.
Key finding
Our findings indicate that nonthermal technology applications can reduce heat usage but cannot reduce CF because they are influenced by the quantity of energy required for operations and the type of energy source used. Some emerging technologies, apart from reducing heat usage, can also reduce energy use in food processes, and enhance the efficiency of the food process or improves the shelf life and quality of food, reduces waste, and reduces the CF of each product. This review provides an overview of the prospects of nonthermal method applications in the food industry and policies to produce environmentally friendly food production. The implementation of new technology to minimize CF is expected to provide a viable alternative for the food industry, although its application requires process optimization for efficient food processing with good nutritional, sensory, and shelf-life qualities.

AB  - Limited adoption of advanced technologies and land fragmentation limit the sustainable intensification of agriculture in developing countries. Here, we explore and establish an integrated management strategy by combining the public-private partnership (PPP) and large-scale farming (LSF) for more profitable and sustainable no-tillage maize production. A case study was conducted in the North China Plain to determine the applicability and the key drivers underpinning PPP-LSF success. On average, maize under PPP-LSF yielded 10.4 Mg ha−1, which was 11.8% and 19.4% greater than that of LSF and smallholder farming (SHF), respectively. Compared with LSF and SHF, the PPP-LSF achieved the highest energy use efficiency and the lowest negative environmental externalities. The carbon footprint of PPP-LSF was 267 kg CO2-eq Mg−1, which was 32.7% and 38.2% lower than that of LSF and SHF, respectively. A new causal factor analysis developed in this study revealed that the mechanised application of controlled-release formula fertilisers, eliminating top-dressing, was the main factor for low carbon footprint in PPP-LSF. The mean net ecosystem carbon budget (NECB), sustainability index, and net ecosystem economic benefit of PPP-LSF were 22.5 Mg C ha−1, 17.1 and 2040 $ ha−1, respectively, which were increased by 15.3% and 23.9%, 55.5% and 69.3%, and 28.7% and 50.3% compared with LSF and SHF. Higher net primary productivity related soil carbon sequestration potential and lower field carbon emissions were the main drivers of high NCEB of PPP-LSF. This real-world commercial crop production-based example illustrates the value and potential of PPP-LSF in utilising modern innovative farming technologies and management strategies to accelerate agricultural productivity and resources conservation with reduced environmental footprints.

AB  - Banning sales of passenger cars with internal combustion engines is becoming a common climate change mitigation policy. This study analyzes the effects of such a ban on the carbon footprints of passenger car travel in Sweden using a novel vehicle turnover model and prospective lifecycle assessment, with scenarios for decarbonization of supply chains. A ban on internal combustion engines results in significantly decreased carbon footprints primarily due to reduced tailpipe CO2 emissions. The full effect of a ban is delayed due to fleet inertia. Increasing the pace of electrification is beneficial for the carbon footprint regardless of global manufacturing decarbonization pathways. A ban in 2030 is not sufficient to reach national policy targets for the transport sector, requiring either an earlier ban (i.e., 2025) or increased biofuel use. Risks of carbon leakage may motivate extending current regulations of vehicle-specific tailpipe emissions to also cover carbon footprints for new cars.

AB  - Corporations have come under pressure from investors and other stakeholders to disclose and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). Corporate GHG footprints, proxying for transition risk, are dominated by carbon emissions from energy use. Thus the growing attention on the carbon emissions of corporations from, principally, their energy use, motivates firms to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy. However, only a subset of corporations disclose their GHG/carbon footprints. This paper uses machine learning to improve the prediction of corporate carbon emissions for risk analyses by investors. We introduce a two-step framework that applies a Meta-Elastic Net learner to combine predictions from multiple base-learners as the best emission prediction approach. It results in an accuracy gain based on mean absolute error of up to 30% as compared with the existing models. We also find that prediction accuracy can be further improved by incorporating additional predictors (energy production/consumption data) and additional firm disclosures in particular sectors and regions. This provides an indication of where policymakers should concentrate their efforts for greater level of disclosure.

AB  - The relationship between macroeconomic factors and environmental pollution has been widely researched during the last two decades. The Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) has been investigated in a number of nations. However, the empirical research concentrating on evaluating two different environmental proxies for ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian) countries has not been done earlier. Furthermore, the majority of studies considered first-generation econometric approaches since they fail to account for cross-sectional dependency in their estimation. For this intention, the study used the second generation: CADF and CIPS unit root tests, Westerlund cointegration test, fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS) and Pooled Mean Group (PMG) to reinvestigate the EKC hypothesis in ASEAN nations between 1991 and 2016, examining two EKC specifications and comparing the validity of the EKC for consumption-based emissions (CO2 emission) and footprint-based emissions (ecological footprint). The empirical findings indicate that: (i) when using the EF, ‘the inverted U-shaped hypothesis’ is valid in ASEAN; on the contrary, when using the CO2 emissions, the ‘inverted U-shaped hypothesis’ is not valid in these countries; (ii) Non-renewable energy (NREC) has a significantly positive effect on EF and CO2 emissions whereas renewable energy consumption (REC) decreases environmental pollution in these countries; (iii) Unidirectional causality is reported between economic growth and environmental degradation while a bidirectional relationship is found between NREC and EF. A Significant policy recommendation is highlighted for ASEAN countries to encourage the consumption of renewable energy to lower CO2 emissions in the future and more efforts are needed to maintain the environmental sustainability.

AB  - Iberian pig production has its own quality regulation, which defines different handling and feeding systems for this breed. These differences influence production costs, market price and environmental impact. The most extensive system of fattening Iberian pigs is based on foraging acorns in a silvopastoral system named dehesa, and consumers usually associate the Iberian pork with this system, although nowadays more intensive systems are dominant due to their productivity and management simplicity. The aim of this study is to assess the Carbon Footprint (CF) of the different Iberian pig production systems using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. This study is based on data collected from 19 Iberian pig farms producing nursery growers (≤25 kg, 2 farms), pre-finished pigs (100–110 kg, 3 farms) and 3 types of finished pigs (150–175 kg), including free-range fattened pigs (17 farms), outdoor intensively fattened pigs (2 farms) and indoor intensively fattened pigs (2 farms). The CF was calculated with a “cradle to farm gate” approach using the kg of live weight (kgLW) as functional unit, and including C sequestration in soils and biomass, which was calculated by field monitoring in a selection of measuring points. The average CFs of the final products were 9.2 ± 2.5 kg CO2eq kgLW−1 for nursery growers, 5.6 ± 2.42 kg CO2eq kgLW−1 for pre-finished pigs, −5.6 ± 6.5 kg CO2eq kgLW−1 for free-range fattened pigs, 3.1 ± 1.5 kg CO2eq kgLW−1 for outdoor intensively fattened pigs and 7.7 ± 0.3 kg CO2eq kgLW−1 for intensively fattened pigs. The main C sinks of the dehesa system (trees and soil) sequestered an average of 3.18 t CO2eq ha−1 year−1. This C sequestration, averaging −10.2 ± 6.7 kg CO2eq kgLW−1 in free-range pig production, offsets 223% of the GHG emissions in those systems, which resulted in a negative CF (net CO2 sequestration). There was a direct relationship between CF and pig stocking rate, leading to strongly negative CF values on those farms with the lowest pig stocking rates.

AB  - A nutritionally balanced, environmentally friendly diet is a prerequisite for the coordinated and sustainable development of human health and the environment. Acquiring a balanced and environmentally friendly diet remains a great global challenge, especially in rural areas in developing countries. As an important indicator for urbanization, non-farm employment has been proven effective in promoting food consumption and diversity in rural areas. However, it remains to be verified how non-farm employment impact food structure, nutrition levels and environmental impact, especially the relationship between sustainability dimension and diet quality improvement needs to be explored. Based on the food consumption data of 996 rural households in China in 2019, the impact of non-farm employment on household food consumption, structure, nutrition levels, and carbon footprint was estimated. It was found that the dietary nutrition structure in rural areas of China is still unbalanced, with ample room for improvement. Non-farm employment will accelerate the adjustment of family dietary structure and the improvement of nutrition level, especially for low-income families. Meanwhile, it will not cause significant increase of food-related carbon footprint. Promotion of rural households’ non-farm employment and publicity health and nutrition knowledge are important ways to strengthen food structure and nutrition promotion.

AB  - Agriculture and animal husbandry are important sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and contribute to climate change, but the carbon sink function of cropland and grassland plays an important role in mitigating climate changes. Based on ecological footprint methodology, this study comprehensively considered carbon emission and carbon sequestration in order to calculate the carbon footprints from agriculture and animal husbandry, and analyzed spatiotemporal distribution of carbon emission, carbon sequestration, and carbon footprint on the QTP. The results showed that during the period of 1990–2015, the carbon emissions of agriculture and animal husbandry on the QTP increased by 163% and 41%, respectively. Agricultural carbon sequestration showed an increasing trend with a growth rate of 45%, and animal husbandry carbon sequestration showed that it increased by 40% in the period of 1990–2005 and then decreased by 28% in the period of 2005–2015. The carbon footprint of agriculture reduced by 23% from 1990 to 1995, then grew by 112% from 1995 to 2015, and the animal husbandry carbon footprint reduced by 18% from 1990 to 2005 then grew by 71% from 2005 to 2015; both of these phenomena showed the downward trends first before trending upward. The high carbon emission and sequestration regions of agriculture were mainly distributed in the southeastern and northwestern areas of the QTP, and the high carbon footprint regions of agriculture were centered in the southeastern and northeastern areas. The high carbon emission regions of animal husbandry were located in southeastern areas, while the high carbon sequestration regions were in the southeastern, southwestern and middle areas. Additionally, the high carbon footprint regions were in southwestern areas. All measures mentioned showed a significant variation in spatial distribution. The economic and population growth contributed to the increase in carbon footprint despite technological advances. This study propose options to reduce the carbon emission and suggestions to improve carbon sink function. This study provides an important basis for policy formulation and planning for sustainable agriculture on the QTP.

AB  - The social consequences of carbon taxation are closely related to the income and expenditure patterns of private households. This paper combines the national Household Budget Survey with EXIOBASE3 emissions data to analyse the distribution of the carbon footprint and differences in the exposure to carbon taxation in Austria. The results indicate a strong variation in greenhouse gas (CO2e) emissions along the income distribution, with the top income decile emitting 4.1 times more than the bottom income decile. We distinguish between local, EU-based, and rest-of-the-world (RoW) emissions and study how various approaches to CO2e taxation would affect households with different incomes. Finally, we compare the implications of taxing direct domestic emissions only versus taxing the carbon footprint and find socio-demographic factors that explain why some households have higher tax-to-income ratios. Socially balanced carbon mitigation policies should focus on these emitters as they might be particularly exposed to CO2e taxation.

AB  - Tracking the origin of greenhouse gases (GHGs) is critical for understanding regional GHG concentration variation and developing effective policies to reduce GHG emissions. This study provides quantitative information about the surface contribution to enhancement of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration at Anmyeon-do (AMY), South Korea, using Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT) model and anthropogenic CO2 emission data. CO2 enhancement simulated by the STILT and emission data was positively correlated with measured CO2 anomalies at AMY with a correlation coefficient above 0.5. High and low CO2 days were selected using ground measurements of the CO2 mixing ratio at AMY during the winter season of 2018–2019. The surface contributions for the high and low CO2 days at AMY were compared quantitatively. When the high concentration was observed in AMY, the CO2 enhancements were dominated by domestic regions, especially from the metropolitan area in South Korea, due to the high footprint and large CO2 emissions. From the perspective of foreign regions, the surface contribution of eastern China regions (Shandong, Jiangsu-Shanghai) increased during high CO2 days compared to low CO2 days at AMY. During the high CO2 days, the ratio between CO2 and carbon monoxide, a co-emitted species, is large when the surface contribution of eastern China regions is relatively strong due to different regional combustion efficiency (i.e., high combustion efficiency in South Korea compared to that in China). The surface contribution based on STILT and emission data is useful for understanding the cause of high GHG concentration at the receptor (AMY in this study).

AB  - The Iron and Steel Industry (ISI) is a difficult-to-mitigate sector that has considerable contributions to energy consumption, water pollution, and CO2 emissions. Despite broad interest in energy consumption and CO2 emissions generated by steel production, there are few impact-oriented Water Footprint (WF) assessments of steel production. This study evaluates the water, carbon and fossil energy footprints generated from rolled steel production on the basis of life cycle assessment. Key contributors attributing to those environmental impacts are also identified so as to explore their potential mitigation. Using the Monte Carlo model, an uncertainty analysis is conducted with the aim of providing reliable results for decision-making. Results show that the impact per ton China’s rolled steel production has on global warming, human health, ecosystem quality, and resources is 4.40 × 103 kg CO2 eq (GSD2 = 1.24), 4.15 × 10-3 Disability Adjusted of Life Years (DALY) (GSD2 = 1.31), 7.08 × 10-5 Species·yr (GSD2 = 2.04), and 4.39 × 104 MJ (GSD2 = 1.28), respectively. Global warming and freshwater ecotoxicity is the dominant contributor to the damage impact on human health and ecosystem quality, respectively. Results also show that the transport (freight ship) of raw materials and the production of iron powder are the two main contributors to the overall impact on the environment that rolled steel production has. Several policy recommendations are proposed in this paper, which focus on adjusting the steel industry’s industrial structure, promoting the national-level carbon emissions trading in the ISI, promoting international cooperation, and improving public awareness of green and low-carbon development. Such policy recommendations provide decision-makers with valuable insights, which thus allow them to prepare the appropriate mitigation policies.

AB  - This study investigates and evaluates the European expert's selection and conjoined degree of willingness to decrease the carbon footprint (WDC) of consuming products and services to mitigate climate change. The survey respondents were segregated into four European regions based on their nationality viz. Nordic, Baltic, and Eastern Europe (NBE), Central and South-eastern Europe (CSE), Western and southern Europe (WSE), and North-western Europe (NWE). The WDC are represented by four index categories viz. low willing, moderate willing, willing, and highly willing. The WDC indicators such as housing, food, energy, waste and transport were used to identify the trend and correlation, gender-specific density distribution, and overall regional comparison analysis. The trend and correlation analysis between energy vs. transport, waste vs. food, and a separate state of housing represented the current global carbon emission situation, where four overlapping clusters indicated the respondent's closest or similar selection at their consumption level. The gender-specific density suggests that the male respondent's average WDC for housing and food index ranges from moderate to highly willing. In contrast, the female average WDC for food, waste, energy and transport index ranges from moderate willing to willing and bimodal for other scenarios. Among the regional comparisons, NBE in housing (moderate willing to willing), CSE in food (willing to highly willing), WSE and CSE in energy and all the regions in waste management (willing to highly willing) presented better indices. In transport, Europe as a whole exhibits poor index. In case of WDC index, the regional comparison indicates that the CSE region exhibited better outcomes than the other regions, except for housing. The findings of this study will be beneficial for the common people, researchers, policymakers, and regulators to enrich their future thoughts and contributes to the development and improvement of the existing carbon reduction policies, especially in the transport sector.

AB  - Building sector is a major contributor to the emissions of pollutant gases, which are responsible for health-damaging effects of climate change. To quantify and reduce these emissions. This comparative study is presented between two buildings that could have a sanitary or any other type of use. Both buildings have similar characteristics, except for their structures, one made of metal and the other of concrete. The design, structural calculation and three-dimensional dimensioning were performed using Building Information Modeling (BIM). The budget and the product carbon footprint study were also carried out, to calculate the level of emissions of each building. The study determined higher emissions for the metal-structured building, with 621.234 tCO2/tmaterial compared to 446.707 tCO2/tmaterial for the concrete building. To reduce these emissions, measures related to the replacement of the previously selected materials, by other materials with lower emission rates and identical functionality were presented, such as the replacement of metal building roof polyurethane, or the composition of cement for the concrete building. Both actions represented a reduction of 84.61% CO2 emissions for metal envelope building and 31.765% for the concrete structure. The results of this work will help to select more sustainable materials to use in the renovation of existing buildings, or in the construction of new buildings. For example, health-related buildings, currently in high demand, given the current pandemic situation caused by COVID-19.

AB  - Increasing demand for lithium driven by e-mobility spurs the expansion of lithium projects and exploration of lower-grade resources. This article combines process simulation (HSC Chemistry) and life cycle assessment tools to develop life cycle inventories considering declining ore grades scenarios for battery-grade Li2CO3 production from pivotal sources and regions (Salar de Atacama - brine and Greenbushes - spodumene). Depending on the ore grades, climate change results range from 5,0 to 25,0 kgCO2eq/kg Li2CO3 for brine and from 17,1 to 22,3 kgCO2eq/kg Li2CO3 for spodumene. Water consumption for brine varies from 0,2 to 7,7 m3/kg Li2CO3, depending on flow accounting, while for spodumene, it ranges from 0,2 to 0,5 m3/kg Li2CO3. The research shows that decreasing ore grade can lead to a fivefold increase in the carbon footprint for brine-based production and a 1.3-fold increase for spodumene. This underscores the importance of decarbonizing energy provision for lithium production to guarantee a sustainable battery supply chain. This research offers insights into using process simulation to enhance existing LCA studies in the raw materials industry and further develop inventory datasets, considering variations such as deposit ore grades.

AB  - Leisure travel within the European Union (EU) contributes significantly to the carbon footprint of global tourism. Distance travelled is a main factor in this impact, but some of its determinants remain unexplored. We examined the role of tourists' holiday preferences in shaping the carbon footprint of leisure travel within the EU by calculating demand and impact indicators associated with eight holiday styles. We find a substantial and equivalent carbon footprint for visiting relatives, nature tourism and sea, sun and sand tourism, but a higher carbon intensity of travel per trip for the latter. This is due to widespread demand for sea, sun, and sand tourism despite the concentration of destinations in Southern Europe. Furthermore, international travel within the EU is on average three times more carbon intensive than domestic travel. Our insights suggest that tourists’ holiday preferences can be leveraged for the sustainable development of leisure travel within the EU.

AB  - With the right policies and investments, regional trade integration and energy transition can offer a unique opportunity for economic development and environmental sustainability in Asian countries. Therefore, exploring the determinants of resource sustainability from unique perspectives is crucial. Hence, this study explores the role of regional trade integration, energy transition, and financial development on trade-adjusted resource footprints in selected Asian countries from 1990 to 2021 using Cross-Sectional Augmented Distributed Lag (CS-ARDL) estimation strategy. The preliminary findings expose that cross-sections are heterogenous and the variables are cointegrated. The long-run estimates reveal that improvement in regional trade integration (across borders), and renewable energy transition reduce resource footprints. At the same time, economic growth, financial development, and industrialization contribute to higher resource consumption in the region. These findings are consistent across alternative estimators and recommend relevant policies.

AB  - Many recent initiatives have been introduced to enhance ecological sustainability by minimizing countries' ecological footprints (EF). The focus has been on achieving environmental footprint neutrality through the application of green technologies (GT) and financial development (FD) in facilitating this transition. To determine the contribution of these variables to sustainability, this study investigated the effects of GT and FD on EF in Algeria from Q1/1990 to Q4/2021. Additionally, this research examines the moderating role of GT with FD on EF. To achieve these objectives, advanced Fourier autoregressive distributed lag techniques and the Fourier causality test were employed. The findings reveal that FD increases EF, leading to ecological degradation. Conversely, GT reduces EF in the long run, demonstrating its potential to foster ecological sustainability. Notably, the study highlights the significant moderating role of GT in the FD-EF relationship. This underscores the critical role of environmental technologies in mitigating the adverse effects of FD by facilitating creative technologies and lowering EF. Therefore, the study recommends that Algeria integrates GT with FD to achieve long-term reduction of environmental harm. In conclusion, Algeria needs to hasten GT in combination with stronger FD to mitigate ecological impacts without compromising sustainable economic growth.

AB  - Irrigated agriculture has tripled since 1950, accounting for 20% of the global arable land and 40% of food production. Irrigated agriculture increases food security yet has controversial implications for global climate change. Most previous studies have calculated carbon emissions and their composition in irrigated areas using the engineering approach to life-cycle assessment. By combining life cycle assessment (LCA)-based carbon emissions accounting with econometric models such as multiple linear regression and structural equation modeling (SEM), we conducted an interdisciplinary study to identify the influencing factors and internal mechanisms of the carbon footprint (CFP) of smallholder crop cultivation on irrigation reform pilot areas. To this end, we investigated corn and potato production data in the 2019–2020 crop years for 852 plots of 345 rural households in six villages (two irrigation agriculture pilot villages and four surrounding villages as controls) in Southwest China. The crop CFP in the irrigation agriculture pilot areas was significantly lower than in non-reform areas. Irrigation reforms mainly impacted the crop CFP through four intermediary effects: the project (implementation of field irrigation channels), technology (improving adoption of new irrigation technologies), management (proper irrigation operation and maintenance), and yield effects. All effects inhibited the CFP, except for the project effect that promotes carbon emissions. Among them, yield increase has the greatest impact on reducing CFP, followed by management and technology effects. Furthermore, planting practices, individual characteristics, and plot quality significantly impacted the crop CFP. This study has policy implications for understanding the food security–climate nexus in the food production industry.

AB  - The environment carrying capacity and reduction of carbon emissions are the challenges faced in the ecologically fragile areas. Therefore, the evaluation of carbon security is imperative. This paper, using Yunnan as an example, built up models of carbon footprint and vegetation carbon carrying capacity to assess the level of carbon security. The IPCC method, which is internationally recognized and universal applied, was adopted to calculate carbon footprint. Forest, grassland and crop plant were selected to calculate carbon carrying capacity. The study relied on data from 2008 to 2017 for analysis and arrived at the conclusion that Yunnan's carbon footprint rose from 272.48 million tonnes in 2008 to 317.71 million tonnes in 2017. The result shows that the carbon carrying capacity of vegetation assumed an increasing trend from 339.52 million tonnes in 2008 to 416.30 million tonnes in 2017. The carbon pressure index was 0.80 in 2008 and 0.76 in 2017, showing a trend of first rising and then falling. This implies that Yunnan is carbon surplus and the level of carbon security is within the region of relatively safe. It is appropriate to improve upon the carbon carrying capacity and reduce the carbon footprint to maintain carbon security in the future.

AB  - Constructed wetlands (CWs) are engineering systems recognized as an efficient and sustainable option to wastewater treatment. Due to the growing interest in CWs for waste management, the number of works analyzing their footprint and impact has risen in the last years. Thus, the study of these systems and their components in construction, operation, and demolition phases is important to characterize the technology and achieve a fully environmental-friendly approach. Until now, no complete tools for measuring both direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in CWs have been reported in the field. Some efforts in this line are Life Cycle Assessment tools, which can be economically expensive and usually require specific training. Therefore, this work aims to present a web application as an open and complete tool for the estimation of GHG emissions in CWs, including both direct and indirect emissions and considering all the stages involved in their management.

AB  - With the growing concern of global warming, many water utilities are pioneering in mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with some water utilities aiming to achieve net-zero emissions operation in the next decade. However, for wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), the carbon footprint of different treatment technologies and its contribution among various units within each treatment configuration is still unclear. This study evaluates the impacts of process design on the carbon footprint of WWTPs through the analysis of scope 1 (direct emission), scope 2 (indirect emission), and scope 3 (value chain emission) emissions. The comprehensive configuration design in this work considered three nutrient removal processes including typical aerobic and anaerobic wastewater treatment technologies. Emissions from the sludge management processes are also calculated, including aerobic and anaerobic sludge stabilization processes, short-term and long-term sludge storage, and three sludge disposal options. In total, 45 processes were analysed and the results were compared. The results showed the carbon footprints are highly dependent on the treatment configurations of WWTPs. Analysis suggested scope 2 & 3 emissions can be reduced by selecting suitable processes. In general, anaerobic wastewater and sludge stabilization technologies are more suitable than aerobic technologies to reduce scope 2 & 3 emissions, leading to a lower overall carbon footprint. In comparison, configuration design offers limited opportunities to reduce scope 1 emissions, which may be the future challenge for WWTP to achieve carbon neutrality.

AB  - Recent high-level reports state the population should decrease meat consumption to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as well as improve public health. This calls for new strategies to change dietary habits, especially as many consumers are reluctant to eat less meat. This study tests the effect of labelling a meat-based ready meal with different levels of carbon footprint and healthiness on consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for these attributes. Participants took part in two sequential non-hypothetical discrete choice experiments (DCE). In the first experiment, they completed a DCE where the ready meals (i.e. beef lasagne) were labelled using a dual traffic light labelling system; one labelled for carbon footprint and one for healthiness. In the second experiment, participants repeated the DCE after they were told the carbon footprint and healthiness varied because of the meat and saturated fat content, respectively. The study found that participants were willing to pay a premium for the healthier lasagne and this did not change when they were given the information about saturated fat content. Participants were also willing to pay a premium for lasagne with a lower carbon footprint, but this decreased when they knew these meals contained less meat. Information about the meat content had the unintended consequence of discouraging people to buy lasagne with a low carbon footprint. The study provides an important insight for policy and industry into the effect of labelling information on consumers’ purchasing decisions at a time when people are being encouraged to eat less meat.

AB  - Many countries have set ambitious goals to achieve carbon neutrality around 2050. In this context food production systems are of interest, as they contribute one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions. This study assessed the carbon footprint (CF) of maize production under different agricultural management practices and scenarios based on a cradle-to-farm gate life cycle analysis and DNDC model, considering future climate impacts and clean energy use. Maintaining the current energy use strategy, under the management of residue removal, future climate change will lead to a 3.0% increase in the CF of maize, while in the residue returning system, the CF of maize will decrease by 40.9%. In the highly mechanized maize production system, the CF of maize was shown to be mainly determined by the CO2 equivalent emissions (CE) from upstream production and in-field portions, including soil emissions and the use of agricultural machinery. Residue return plays a critical role in establishing maize's CF, making maize fields a carbon sink. The use of clean energy can reduce the CF of maize by 482.9±8.6 kg CO2 eq ha−1. Our study serves as a reference for determining the potential of mitigating the total carbon emissions from maize production by 2050.

AB  - Transportation infrastructures play an important role in building energy-efficient and low-carbon cities. Yet, how existing and newly-built assets contribute differently to the footprints of transportation infrastructures is not clear. In this paper, we develop a life-cycle approach to quantify the energy and carbon footprints of urban transportation infrastructures over time, with a clear differentiation between existing and newly-built assets. Taking Guangzhou, China as a case study, we evaluate the dynamic footprints of various types of urban transportation infrastructure (roads, subway, and railway) across their life-cycle stages until 2017, and perform a scenario analysis to 2035 to explore future pathways of footprint mitigation. We find that the energy and carbon footprints of road assets built prior to 2005 are around 36 times higher than those of the subway and 5 times higher than those of the railway. However, this situation has begun to shift over 2006–2017 as the subway and railway have become more popular means of transportation and bigger contributors to the city’s energy and carbon footprints. The pace of technological advances in building transportation infrastructure needs to exceed that of the average urban economy to steadily reduce the energy and carbon footprints of the new projects planned. These findings offer a dynamic life-cycle approach and tool to evaluate long-term regulatory policies toward a more sustainable transportation infrastructure system in cities.

AB  - This study examines the significance of technological industry and forest on environmental footprints. As control variables, we included renewable energy, and urbanization for econometric estimations. Contrary to what has been published in the literature, the forest coefficients are negligible. In contrast, the current study confirms the importance of technology and renewable energy in reducing environmental footprints, indicating that environmental degradation can be reduced by shifting toward technological industry and changing the energy market by increasing the percentage of sustainable energy. In Saudi Arabia, on other hand, urbanization is the source of increased environmental footprints. In short-run estimations, the studied variables are insignificant to have an impact on environmental footprint. According to Vision 2030, the findings are similar to policies, particularly for forestation, need to be adjusted. The role of forest remains insignificant, indicating that forestation must be addressed urgently. The findings are intriguing and have significant policy implications for environmental policymakers.

AB  - By automating tasks with precision and efficiency, industrial robots help minimize resource utilization and emissions, making them indispensable allies in our quest to minimize our ecological footprint. The core intention of the present article is to scrutinize the impact of industrial robots on the ecological footprint in ten leading industrial artificial intelligence nations (Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, USA, China, France, and Italy) from 2007 to 2020. Prior investigations have chosen panel data methodologies to detect the association between industrial robots and ecological footprint. Nonetheless, these studies often overlooked the variations in this relationship across different countries. In contrast, this article choses the Quantile-on-Quantile approach to assess this relationship on a country-specific basis. This methodology offers a comprehensive global perspective while delivering tailored insights relevant to each nation. The findings suggest that industrial robots improve environmental quality by decreasing ecological footprint across different data quantiles in chosen nations. The findings also underline that the asymmetries between our variables differ from country to country. These revelations underscore the importance of policymakers carefully assessing and skillfully managing strategies related to both industrial robots and the ecological footprint.

AB  - There is a limited comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness of adopted carbon mitigation strategies for buildings over their life cycle, that are concerned with temporal perspectives of emissions. Accordingly, this paper explores a life cycle assessment (LCA) to address the concerns regarding mitigating the carbon footprint of a UK timber-frame low-energy dwelling. In particular, it aims to investigate the potential greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction in terms of three different heating and ventilation options, and to analyze the influence of decarbonization of electricity production as well as the technological progress of the waste treatment of timber on the building's environmental performance. Thus, the whole life‑carbon of the building case studies was evaluated for a total of eight investigated prospective scenarios, and they were compared to the LCA results of the baseline scenario, where the existing technology and context remained constant over time. Results show that using a compact heat pump would lead to a significant whole life-cycle emission reduction of the dwelling, by 19 %; while GHG emission savings can be reinforced if the assessed systems are employed simultaneously with grid decarbonization, exhibiting a 25 %–60 % reduction compared to the baseline scenario. Moreover, technological changes in the waste treatments of timber products could substantially reduce the buildings' embodied emissions, representing 3 %–23 %. From these emission-saving measures, the contribution of material efficiency strategies to achieve more embodied carbon savings should be highlighted in future construction practices.

AB  - China has become the global largest electric vehicle (EV) market, making the energy and climate issues of EV industry in terms of life cycle attract widespread attention. Based on the self-designed life-cycle analysis tool and up-to-date database, this study analyzes energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of a typical passenger internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV), and battery EV (BEV) and plug-in hybrid EV (PHEV) installed with different lithium-ion battery types, covering both fuel cycle and vehicle cycle. Owing to the battery installation, which shares nearly 30% of the GHG emissions in EV's vehicle cycle, the BEV and PHEV emit 13533–15445 kgCO2,eq/vehicle and 11572–12186 kgCO2,eq/vehicle, 65.6%–89.0% and 41.6%–49.1% higher than that of the ICEV, respectively. EV's fuel-cycle low emissions offset its surplus emissions in vehicle cycle. The EV generates 219.8–230.9 gCO2,eq/km in life cycle, achieving 18.3%–22.6% of reduction compared to the ICEV. Development of non-fossil power will highlight the advantages of EVs in energy conservation and GHG emission reduction, e.g. if the proportion of coal power decreased to 10%, BEV's life-cycle GHG emissions will reduce about 70% than current level. Policies should focus on both EVs development acceleration and the low-carbon automotive and battery industry creation.

The long-term experiential estimations estimated from the battery of second-generation methods, which tackled other econometric estimation problems such as heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependency. The empirical outcomes discovered that natural resources and globalization process in South Asian region significantly increase the level of ecological footprint in the long-run. Conversely, technological innovations, forest area, and renewable energy upsurge environmental sustainability by reducing ecological footprint in the and long-run. Moreover, the interaction of natural resources with technological innovation, forest area, and renewable energy also adds in curtailing the level of ecological footprint and aid in achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 13. Based on the estimated findings, substantial policy recommendations are suggested like improving the extraction of natural resources, promoting energy efficiency, investment in energy technologies, and increasing the deployment of renewable energy sources to increase technological invention and achieve the goal of a net-zero-emissions.

AB  - The booming express delivery industry corresponds to the environmental challenges caused by massive express packaging waste (EPW). An efficient logistics network is necessary link to support EPW recycling. This study, therefore, designed a circular symbiosis network for EPW recycling based on urban symbiosis strategy. The treatment of EPW in this network includes reuse, recycling and replacing. An optimization model with multi-depot collaboration combining material flow analysis and optimization methods was developed and a hybrid non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) was designed as technical support for designing the circular symbiosis network while quantitatively assessing the economic and environmental benefits of the network. The results show that the designed circular symbiosis option has better resource saving and carbon footprint reduction potential than both the business as usual option and circular symbiosis option without service collaboration. In practice, the proposed circular symbiosis network can save EPW recycling costs and reduce carbon footprint. This study provides a practical guideline for the application of urban symbiosis strategies to help urban green governance and the sustainable development of express companies.

AB  - Financial structure is the primary director of economic activity in a capitalist society, it also has an important societal role in encouraging investments that are beneficial to the natural and human ecosystems. To accomplish this objective, this study addresses the unattended symmetric linkages between financial structure, energy depletion, and environmental degradation using multiple ecological footprints ‘’ (built-up land, carbon land, cropland, fishing grounds, forest products, and grazing land)’’ as an indicator over the period 1985 to 2018 for Pakistan. By using these six indicators as separate regressands, this research quantifies the impact of financial structure and energy depletion by applying the newly developed Augmented Autoregressive Distributed Lag (AARDL) approach. The outcome reveals that financial structure decreases ecological footprints, similarly, energy depletion also decreases ecological footprints. Opposite to it, trade openness increases ecological footprints, while urban population decreases ecological footprints. Given these results, comprehensive environmental and financial structure development policies are directed to achieve environmental sustainable goals.

AB  - China is the largest aquaculture producer, and grass carp ranks first in the freshwater fish industry. Fish feed is considered among the most important contributor to the impacts of the aquaculture industry. This study aimed at analyzing the different global warming potentials (i.e., carbon footprint; CF) of extruded and pelleted grass carp feed by implementing the life cycle assessment (LCA) method. The cradle-to-gate system boundaries of aquaculture feed includes the raw material production phase, transportation phase, and processing phase, and data were obtained from field investigation, the Ecoinvent 3.7.1 database, and academic references. Furthermore, the CF and emission reduction potential of the entire freshwater fish feed industry in China was estimated, thus providing a basis for decision-makers to achieve carbon neutrality. Our findings indicated that the CF of extruded and pelleted feed was approximately 1334 and 1071 kg CO2 eq/t, respectively. Furthermore, the CFs of grass carp fed with extruded and pelleted feeds was 1876–2134 and 1928–2142 kg CO2 eq/t, respectively. The production of raw materials was the largest contributor to the CF of both feeds. If US soybeans were used, the CF of both grass carp feeds could be reduced by more than 15% compared with Brazilian soybeans. The reduction in the overall CF by using renewable energy sources such as photovoltaic cells would be similar to that of natural gas. The CF of China's freshwater fish feed is projected to reach 1.95 × 107 t CO2 eq in 2020, of which extruded feed and pelleted feed account for 20.32% and 79.68% of the total output, respectively. In this case, if extruded feed is used instead of pelleted feed and the feed conversion ratio is optimal (1.4–1.8), the proportion of freshwater fish fed with extruded feed should not exceed 21.05% of the total production of freshwater fish in order to reduce feed-associated CF.

AB  - Amidst a backdrop of a global climate emergency, tourism continues to contribute to Earth's carbon footprint. In recognition of the negative environmental impacts of sport and event tourism, this study quantifies the carbon footprint of the 2019 National Collegiate Athletic Association Men's Basketball Tournament by considering the travel of fans and teams, food, waste, lodging, and stadium operations. The footprint is approximated at 210 million kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents. Broken down, this equates to about 500 kg per participant. Travel is responsible for nearly 80 percent of that total which underscores the positive relationship between distance traveled and greenhouse gasses emitted in tourism. This paper presents a valuable linear model by which carbon footprints can be calculated with accessible data. This will, in turn, allow for the democratization of sustainability models for industries and organizations to introspectively quantify their environmental impact as an initial assessment for internal purposes or comparison to outside audits. This study's results demonstrate the need to make mega sport-tourism events like March Madness more sustainable. However, this can only be done by tourism managers closing the environmental value-action gap that too often manifests as inaction. By leveraging quantitative frameworks such as this study's methodology, sport and event managers can more easily use readily available data to evaluate their event's environmental impacts and thus begin to actionably mitigate their negative contributions to global climate change in more targeted ways.

AB  - The wine industry is extremely vulnerable to climate change given the impact of temperature, water or soil conditions on wine production. Transformation strategies toward more sustainable models would help the industry to overcome the weak points. The present study evaluates the environmental impact of the so-called CO2-alcoholic fermentation processes (CO2-AFP) strategy, a recently developed eco-innovative strategy, which offers a new pathway toward a greener wine-making production with a 16.79% reduction of the carbon footprint considering scopes 1 (direct emissions), 2 (emissions generated directly in the production of electricity), and 3 (indirect emissions embodied in the organization's value chain). This strategy is based on a novel Carbon Dioxide Utilization approach from a biogenic CO2 released by fermentation processes to produce a fully marketable and environmentally friendly chemical product at a global level, i.e., sodium carbonate. This paper presents the strategy development corresponding to a real case: a medium-size winery and distillery in Spain, where the “CO2-AFP Strategy” has been successfully tested and scaled-up. Detailed and tested carbon capture and utilization schemes are used to evaluate the overall carbon footprint balance (carbon calculation, capture potential, and carbon balance) via an improved hybrid multiregional input-output-lifecycle assessment model (MRIO-LCA). The benefits go beyond the reduction of carbon footprint in the fermentation industry. The application of the “CO2-AFP Strategy” implies a revolution, in terms of Circular Economy, in the sodium carbonate industry, as the symbiotic process between the different stages of the value chain will allow downstream carbon footprint reductions, facilitating a greener sodium carbonate production.

AB  - Optimizing ultra-high-performance cementitious composites (UHPCC) with sustainable materials often compromises certain properties due to the chemical nature of alternative binders used to replace standard UHPCC components like Portland cement (OPC) and microsilica (MS). In the context of Waste-Glass-UHPCC, the reduction in early strength, attributed to the varied pozzolanic reactivity of MS and recycled glass powder as cementitious materials, may reduce its application that requires high early strength. This study addresses the early strength deficiency of Waste-Glass-UHPCC by incorporating metakaolin (MK) and also aims to assess the impact of MK on 28-day compressive strength, durability, and carbon footprint. Research investigating the effects of MK on UHPCC with reduced OPC and MS content is currently limited. Specifically, this investigation explores the influence of MK on UHPCC characterized by a cement content of 620 kg/m3. By utilizing advanced statistical methods [i.e., the Central Composite Design (CCD) and Response Surface Methodology (RSM)], this study investigates the substitution of MK for OPC in formulations of Waste-Glass-UHPCC. The experimental design comprises 18 encoded mixtures, allowing for the development of second-order regression models for critical responses [slump flow and compressive strength at different ages]. Besides, visualization through RSM-3D graphs facilitates a comprehensive examination of the effects of various factors. For a deeper analysis, two of the CCD's points, i.e., SP-12 (Waste-Glass-UHPCC without metakaolin), and SP-10 (Waste-Glass-UHPCC with 65.77 kg of metakaolin per cubic meter) were further investigated along with a control dosage that represents a typical UHPCC formulation. The responses studied encompassed 1, 7, and 28 d compressive strength, chloride ion penetration, and carbon footprint measured by a systematic life cycle analysis (following ISO 15804), assessing the environmental impact of the UHPCC's making materials from raw extraction to disposal. Despite encountering challenges in meeting self-compacting concrete criteria due to MK's tendency to accelerate hydration, the enhanced early strength properties (61 % higher than those of the Waste-Glass-UHPCC) make the MK-based mixture appropriate for various applications such as bridge engineering or pavement rehabilitation. Additionally, the addition of MK in UHPCC formulation demonstrated superior resistance to chloride ion permeability even compared to the control mixture, attributed to MK's ability to enhance the concrete's microstructure and capture chloride ions, attributed to Friedel's salt formation. Noteworthy findings include a significant (27 %) reduction in carbon footprint with the incorporation of MK in Waste-Glass-UHPCC compared to the control counterparts. The current study highlights the durability and environmental advantages of MK-based UHPCC blends while emphasizing the critical requirements of workability and strength development of sustainable UHPCC.

AB  - With the establishment of several carbon peak and carbon neutrality strategies in China, urban carbon mitigation has become a critical issue. Understanding how cities obtain, distribute, and manage their carbon emissions could be an essential step for collaborative management of regional carbon emission reduction. In the present study, by compiling a nested multi-regional input-output table, an investigation was conducted into the city-level carbon footprints and inter-regional CO2 transfer embodied in the trade of finished goods at home and abroad for 29 cities in Central Plain urban agglomeration. The total carbon footprint of the urban agglomeration was found to be 1144.6 Mt, accounting for 10% of the national emissions, and significant differences were observed in the city-level carbon footprints, ranging from 3.2 Mt (Huaibei) to 176.3 Mt (Zhengzhou). The carbon footprint per capita also varied greatly, from Huaibei (1.4 t) to Jiyuan (20.7 t), and was significantly correlated with GDP per capita. CO2 emissions due to capital formation contributed the most to the carbon footprint, followed by urban consumption. Through the export of numerous industrial products to support infrastructure construction and economic activities, the urban agglomeration received 736.3 Mt net emissions from other regions at home and abroad. Significant embodied CO2 transfer was observed to drift from energy-abundant cities, such as Pingdingshan and Shangqiu, to richer cities, such as Zhengzhou and Luoyang. The inter-city CO2 flows were mainly shaped by heavy industry, construction and service sectors. Finally, targeted mitigation policy methods have been recommended for different types of cities from production and consumption perspectives.

AB  - Nordic countries are often recognized as leaders in climate-sustainability. A potential dissonance exists, however, between this perception and the measured sustainability of their lifestyles. In global terms, they are highly affluent countries spreading their climate impact beyond their borders by importing a large share of the energy and resources used by their residents. In this research, we focus on the potential dissonance between the self-perceived climate-sustainability of the lifestyles in the Nordic countries and the actual consumption-based carbon footprints (CBCF), estimated through a survey-based CBCF calculator with ∼8000 respondents across Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland and Iceland. Using bivariate and regression analysis, the study found that across all levels of climate-sustainability perception the CBCF the respondents ranged from 6.3 to 11.3 tCO2-eq/capita, representing a significant difference (79%) between the highest emitting (very low perception) and lowest emitting groups (high perception). A general negative correlation between elevated levels of climate-sustainability perception and CBCF was found, predominantly in the areas of diet, vehicle possession, and consumption of goods and services. Intriguingly, a counterintuitive increase in CBCF at extremely high levels of climate-sustainability perception was seen. Additional factors that contribute to higher climate-sustainability perception are explored, such as age, climate literacy, and pro-climate attitude (PCA). Conversely, individuals with high incomes or belonging to households with children display lower levels of climate-sustainability perception. Across all perception groups, however, the results confront the perception of the Nordics as climate leaders as Nordic CBCFs were still far above the average CBCF for the lowest global 50% of Earth's population and were far above (∼2–4x) suggested 2030 targets to remain below 1.5 °C warming. The findings of this study serve as an invaluable resource for policymakers aiming to align public perception with effective sustainability measures, thereby assisting in reducing CBCF and achieving global climate goals.

AB  - The development of the carbon footprint (CF) of raw cow milk over time has been scarcely researched. The objectives of this study are (1) to determine the annual raw cow milk CF in the Netherlands between 1990 and 2019 and (2) to identify the factors explaining the development of the raw cow milk CF over time. We applied Life Cycle Assessment (cradle to farm gate) to the average Dutch dairy system and used data collected from national statistics and from the farm accountancy data network. The CF of raw cow milk produced in the Netherlands in 2019 was 992 g CO2-eq. per kg Fat and Protein Corrected Milk (FPCM), while in 1990 it was 1522 g CO2-eq. (kg FPCM)−1. This represents a reduction of 35%. The reduction rate of the CF is affected by the scope of the CF study, i.e. reduction rate is smaller if direct land use change (dLUC) (32%) and soil organic carbon (SOC) balance (29%) are included in the total CF. Methodological choices affect the absolute level of the CF by up to 27%, but the impact on the reduction rate over time is negligible. The results show that continuous improvement in agricultural practices (increased milk and roughage yields, improved feed efficiency and decreased nitrogen application) has played an important role in reducing the CF of milk over the years. Along with this process, the Dutch dairy system has evolved into less grazing and less land devoted to permanent grasslands which decreased carbon sequestration. In order to achieve climate targets, the annual reduction rate needs to be increased and additional efforts are required if the Dutch dairy sector is to play its part in limiting global warming to 1.5 °C. Special attention is needed for the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission from enteric fermentation and manure storage. However, the main challenge for the future is to find a balanced set of measures to integrally reduce all the sources of GHG emission within the carbon footprint of milk.

AB  - Carbon footprint (CF) stands for a professional term is widely used in the public domain to cope with the threat posed by climate change. With obtained 9848 records of literature information from the database of Web of Science, a bibliometric analysis was implemented to judge the knowledge domain structure and evolution of frontiers in CF research by using the CiteSpace to make up for the lack of previous reviews. The results showed that the CF research was concentrated in the fields of Engineering, Environmental sciences ecology, Science technology other topics, Energy fuels, Computer science and Business economics, and there is a significant cooperative relationship between researchers, especially those with a high volume of publications. The regional layout of intercontinental CF research forces was Europe, North America, and Asia, while that between countries were the United States of America, China, England, Australia and Italy, specifically, the Chinese Academy of Sciences showed the core force of CF research with a high volume of publications and strong cooperation with international institutions. The debate and application of CF accounting method, Case Studies of CF for livestock and its products production, CF estimation for the final consumption of goods and services, Impact of human food consumption on the climate change, Application of Footprint Family for sustainable development, and CF estimation for household consumption and its drivers were the emerging CF research fronts in historical evolution. Therefore, the CF research has its own characteristics in terms of spatial and temporal layout, cooperation intensity and knowledge hierarchy, and the related topics of cross-application of agriculture and energy are becoming the potential frontier of future research. This work not only provides the possible innovative directions, but also a reliable reference for the rapid and comprehensive understanding of CF research for the novices.

AB  - Achieving a closed-loop recycling process with low CO2 emissions remains a challenge for the concrete industry. To improve the recycling of concrete debris, a powder compaction process for concrete waste was designed to obtain recycled compacted concrete (hereinafter referred to as compact) and thermal treatment was proposed to be utilized to improve its strength. However, non-specific investigations of treatment parameters, like-treatment temperature, and duration, do still exist, and the required high production pressure (100 MPa) is impracticable. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of two novel treatments on compact in improving its strength and reducing its carbon footprint. First, the heat treatment process used in a previous study [1] was expanded by varying immersion durations and treatment temperatures. Second, autoclaving was employed to obtain a stronger compact with different treatment settings. Additionally, in both treatment processes, the efficacy of low production pressure (<100 MPa) was evaluated. For this, eighteen different concrete wastes, having different industrial wastes, like-fly ash, slag, were collected, crushed, and powdered to produce compacts. The treated compacts were characterized based on both compressive strength and carbon footprint to compare the environmental performance of a compact prepared via thermal treatments in the production phase. The test results revealed that increasing water immersion duration (to 48 h) during the heat treatment process improved the compact strength to up to 48 MPa, and autoclaving at higher temperatures (at 220 °C) resulted in a compact strength of up to 98 MPa. Additionally, a strength of 30 MPa was attained even at a low production pressure (10 MPa) after autoclaving. The estimated CO2 emissions of the compact production process developed in this study were as low as 70.6 kg/m3 of compact. At the present stage of the study, it can be deduced that the compact manufactured possesses potential for implementation in various non-structural applications, including the production of pavement blocks and bricks, with lower CO2 emissions.

Using first-hand data from the hotel/restaurant/café sector in four popular tourist cities, the TFW and its CF of the food life cycle for 31 regions in 2019 were quantified. The findings reveal that the average amount of TFW in China was 256.90±11.89 g/d/cap, totaling 9.95±0.50 million t of TFW generated in 2019, with grain accounting for 32.69% (3.25±0.24 million t). Furthermore, the annual CF of TFW attained 23.47±0.43 million t carbon dioxide (CO2) eq in 2019. Meat exhibited the largest CF (55.25%). Geographically, the CF of TFW was consistent with the geographical characteristics of the Hu Line, that is, larger toward the southeast. Notably, the CF of TFW during agricultural production (15.96±0.93 million t CO2 eq or 67.99%) accounted for most of the food life cycle.

AB  - The environmental degradation accompanying economic growth, despite the potential mitigating effects of technological advancements and cleaner energy sources. This study examines the critical impact of cleaner energy sources, advanced technology firms, and economic expansion on ecological footprints within the context of sustainable development, focusing on the period between 2010 and 2022. By comparing the E7 (emerging seven) and G7 (Group of Seven) economies, the research aims to delineate how these factors collectively influence environmental sustainability in both developing and developed nations. Utilizing a robust panel estimation technique, the study systematically explores the relationship between the adoption of renewable energy technologies, the growth of high-tech industries, and macroeconomic expansion, alongside their respective effects on the ecological footprint, a key indicator of environmental impact. Our statistical analysis reveals significant differences between the E7 and G7 countries. For the G7, investments in cleaner energy and technology sectors have shown a more pronounced effect in reducing ecological footprints, attributed to higher efficiency standards and greater public awareness. In contrast, the E7 countries exhibit a delayed response, owing to varying stages of economic development and technological adoption, although promising trends are emerging. Notably, the G7 demonstrates a more pronounced inclination towards financial imperialism (0.043), while the E7 is significantly influenced by green energy sources (0.258). Policy implications drawn from the findings suggest that targeted investments in green technologies and renewable energy sources, coupled with robust policies supporting economic expansion in a sustainable manner, are crucial for both groups of countries. For the E7, accelerating technology transfer and adopting stricter environmental regulations are key, while the G7 should focus on innovation and the continuous improvement of energy efficiency standards. This dual approach is essential for mitigating the environmental impacts of economic growth and steering the global economy towards a more sustainable trajectory.

This paper uses the Time-Varying Parameter Vector AutoRegression (TVP-VAR) model to explore the dynamic relationship between oil price, green bond index, carbon emission trading price and carbon efficiency index. The time-varying impulse response analysis results show that the oil price has a negative effect on the green bond index and carbon price and a positive impact on the carbon efficiency index in the short and medium term. The green bond index has a positive impact on the carbon price in the short and medium term, and a negative impact on the carbon efficiency index. In addition, carbon price shocks have a positive impact on the carbon efficiency index in the short and medium term. The robustness test indicates that our results are robust. These findings can help formulate relevant policies and prevent financial risks under the influence of energy prices.

AB  - Mangrove conservation effort have been undertaken in China, but there is still a lack of quantitative assessment of its eco-environmental benefits. The ecological footprint (EF) is an important indicator of the sustainability of ecosystems, with carbon footprint (CF) and biocapacity (BC) being key indicators of forest ecosystems. Despite the high carbon sequestration capacity of mangrove ecosystems, they have not yet been included in EF. This study introduces mangrove ecosystems into EF accounting and assesses the eco-environmental benefits of mangrove conservation in China. To achieve this, the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of mangrove forests was estimated based on the gross primary production and respiration rates. Average forest carbon sequestration (AFCS) and yield factor, key parameters of CF and BC, were calculated from NEE for the first time. The CF and BC of mangrove ecosystems were then refined using newly defined AFCS and yield factor. The proposed framework was applied to the whole mangrove forests in China to assess mangrove conservation efforts. The results showed that the average CF of mangrove forests is about 1000 M ha, which is lower than that of terrestrial forests, while the BC of mangroves is not as high as expected due to the limited area of mangroves. CF and BC vary along the coastline, whereby CF tends to decrease with decreasing latitude while BC remains high at low latitudes owing to the large mangrove area. There is no significant decreasing trend in CF, but BC increases with increasing mangrove area. The newly introduced ecological footprint accounting of mangrove ecosystems suggests that mangrove conservation in China should focus on ecosystem health and expand the area of forestable land. These findings will benefit future management of mangrove ecosystems in China and other countries.

AB  - A growing imbalance between energy carbon emissions and vegetation carbon sequestration is a major impediment to achieving Sustainable Development Goals. Decoupling the growing imbalance from economic growth needs a stringent and coordinated package of sustainable policies. Previously, enhancing efficiency and vegetation carbon sequestration were dominant drivers to decouple. However, the role and magnitude of restructurings in the energy sector and economy in decoupling were underestimated. In this context, China’s 30 provinces were selected as study areas. By employing a carbon footprint pressure (CFP) indicator to represent the imbalance, a widely decoupling method was adopted to describe the decoupling state and trend of CFP and economic growth. An extended IPAT equation and the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index method were further used to reveal the role and magnitude of drivers on decoupling. The findings revealed that the CFP climbed significantly in 26 provinces between 2006 and 2015. We discovered that 22 provinces were working toward absolute decoupling, with 15 provinces achieving it during the 12-th Five-Year Plan. Our analysis revealed that improving energy efficiency was the primary driver of absolute decoupling, while substituting natural gas and oil for coal, reducing industry share, and enhancing carbon sequestration accelerated absolute decoupling. Considering the limited future role of improving energy efficiency and vegetation carbon sequestration, there is an urgent need to optimize and upgrade the structures of the energy sector and economy to mitigate the future climate risk.

AB  - Sugarcane is an important cash crop used for producing sweeteners and also some bioproducts (alcohol and bioenergy). The current study assesses life cycle energy, carbon and water footprint of sugarcane based sugar, ethanol and electricity in India. A farm to factory gate attributional life cycle assessment (LCA) is conducted to assess the energy and carbon footprints whereas the Food and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) CropWat model is used to estimate the water footprint (green, blue and grey). For the base case, electricity has the highest energy return on investment (EROI), lowest carbon and water footprints among the bioproducts. The choice of allocation method (economic, mass, and energy) impacts the energy and environmental outcomes of the bioproducts. The comparison among four different sugarcane seasons shows that bioproducts available from Adsali sugarcane have the highest EROI, lowest carbon and water footprints. The findings could lead to improved sustainability of sugarcane bioproducts in India.

AB  - Environmental problems resulting from fossil-based energy and the depletion of fossil fuels made the alternation of fossil fuels to the environmentally friendly energy resources necessary, and several countries including Korea, Japan, and Germany have recently spotlighted hydrogen as a feasible alternative to fossil fuels. However, the countries heading for the hydrogen economy are usually unable to meet their demands with the inland supply alone due to infrastructure and economic problems caused by expensive resources and a shortage of land. In this kind of background, introducing overseas hydrogen which can be produced economically by utilizing unused resources and land overseas is regarded as an attractive way to meet demands. In this study, an economic as well as a carbon footprint analysis of overall hydrogen supply from overseas to inland for several hydrogen carriers, including liquid hydrogen, liquid organic hydrogen carriers, and ammonia, were conducted. For ship transportation sector, the cross-overs between unit hydrogen costs of liquid organic hydrogen carriers and liquid hydrogen could be found at around 4,000 km and 1 million tons of hydrogen in trends according to distance and amount, respectively. And for distribution sector, pipeline is significantly feasible due to the large amount while trailers show feasibility with hydrogen amount less than around 4,500 tons for delivery sector. A case study of importing hydrogen from Indonesia to Korea was conducted presenting feasibility with all unit hydrogen costs below the 2030 target as stipulated in the Korean roadmap as well as a guideline regarding which sector contributes majorly and should be improved technically and strategically to fulfill the 2040 target in the roadmap. Here, the uncertainty analysis on the overall carbon footprint for the case study was additionally conducted to indicate the future risks of carbon emission from the immature technology.

AB  - The relationship between natural resources and the ecological footprint has critical environmental implications. However, as critical as it is, this domain is insufficiently examined by researchers, and shows ambiguous results. Moreover, these studies do not address the role of technological innovation in shaping the ecological footprint, in an open and explicit manner. Therefore, realizing the need for a more critical evaluation of the intricacies involved in studying the ecological footprint, this study analyzes the linkages between natural resources, technological innovations, economic growth, and the resulting ecological footprint in emerging economies. Drawing on the data from 1984 to 2016, we employed the second-generation panel cointegration methodologies to study the findings of this research. Results of Pesaran's CD test and P&Y's slope homogeneity test confirm the existence of a slope heterogeneity across countries, and correlation amongst cross-sectional units. Moreover, Cointegration results confirm a stable, long-run relationship between the ecological footprint, natural resources, technological innovations, and economic growth. In the long run, natural resources and economic growth increase and expand the ecological footprint, while technological innovations are helpful in abating environmental degradation that takes place a result of this phenomenon. Furthermore, the quadric term for economic growth showed a negative impact on the ecological footprint, i.e., in the presence of the Environment Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. Additionally, the results from CS-ARDL were reconfirmed by utilizing the Augmented Mean Group (AMG) method. Also, the result of the Dumitrescu-Hurlin Granger causality test shows that any policy to target natural resources, technological innovations, and economic growth significantly alters the ecological footprint and vice versa. Our key findings lead towards the manifestation and emphasis of the importance of appropriate policies for restoring natural resources and at the same time, upgrading technological innovations in order to attain sustainable development goals.

AB  - The Hungarian transport sector plays a significant role in economic development. Inland transport, air transport, and water transport are the main three modes of moving people and goods in Hungary. Therefore, these three modes affect the environment by contributing a significant amount of carbon and energy footprint. In the literature, there is no such study that identifies the environmental impacts of the Hungarian transport sector. Therefore, the lifecycle-based carbon and energy footprint impacts of Hungarian transport practices were assessed in this study, which took into account international trading links with the rest of the world. The Hungarian economy was modeled as part of a multi-region input-output (MRIO) life cycle evaluation system, which included 40 major economies, including the Hungarian, United States, China, Russia, and others and the rest of the world (ROW) nations. According to the WIOD database definition, each country's economy comprises 35 major industries. The global system of the world economy is equalized by a total of 1435 sectors (41 × 35 = 1435). The method is unique in that the MRIO model was constructed in a stochastic manner, taking into account global trade-related uncertainties. Using data mining and predictive simulation methods, the investigation focused on top carbon-emitting and energy-consuming sectors and countries. The outcome illustrated that Hungary has the highest overall carbon footprint (CFP) and total energy footprint (EFP) contributions, respectively, with 59.94% and 45.18%. Furthermore, the inland transportation market and electricity, gas, and water supply were found to be the most dominant industries in terms of overall CFP, accounting for 46.32% and 18.35%, respectively. With 34.64% of the overall effects, the coke/refined petroleum/nuclear fuel market has the highest proportion of the total energy footprint. The transportation sector has a significant role in the Hungarian economy because of the unique geographic location of the country.

AB  - The demand for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) in the global markets has changed significantly. As a result, industries have been forced to consider investing significantly in supply chains to achieve an efficient distribution of LNG for cost efficiency and carbon footprint reduction. To minimize the contribution of LNG maritime transportation to global climate change, there is a need to quantify the carbon footprints systematically. In this research, we developed a novel and practical model for estimating the carbon footprint for LNG maritime transport. Using the MATLAB program, an uncertainty-based carbon footprint accounting framework is created. The Monte Carlo simulation model is built to conduct a carbon footprint analysis while the main input parameters were changed within a reliable range. Later, a multivariate sensitivity analysis is performed using the Risk Solver software to estimate the most significant parameters on the net carbon footprints. The sensitivity analysis results showed that that steam process day and steaming fuel consumption are found to be the most sensitive parameters for the overall carbon footprint for both Laden and Ballast trips. Furthermore, it was found that the Q-Max vessel produces more carbon emissions when compared to the Q-Flex, although both are traveling the same distance and are using the same fuel type. The type of fuel is also significantly affecting the emission values due to the relevant carbon content in the fuel. Like the case of the two conventional vessels, the one that is running with the only LNG is found to have fewer emissions when compared to the one run with dual-mode.

AB  - Abstract
Greenfield precincts offer an opportunity to develop energy hubs, which can help the transition to carbon neutrality. However, this requires a detailed demand model, which is often not available in the early planning stages. To address this need, this paper proposes a novel methodology for building a demand model using available information, including types of zones/sectors present on-site, historical energy consumption of those sectors at a national level, and energy consumption studies on floor-stock basis (i.e., floor area). We apply this approach in a case study energizing the proposed Aerotropolis Core Precinct (ACP) within the wider Aerotropolis site to be constructed in Western Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The model also looks at supplying this demand, and the corresponding associated emissions, for the years 2025, 2035 and 2050 – in line with Australia’s Net Zero-time horizon. Results show that ACP demand increases from 368 GWh in 2025 to 1,233 GWh in 2035 then 1,444 GWh in 2050, as is expected moving from partial to full operation and accounting for temperature-dependent demand fluctuations. Electrical demand is 62% of total demand, while thermal is 38%. Generated supply is estimated to increase from 221 MW (2025) to 866 MW (2035) and 1,077 MW (2050), accounting for capacity factors. Emissions associated with that demand will change from 185 ktCO2eq to 229 ktCO2eq then decrease to 201 ktCO2eq due to an increasingly “greener” technology mix predicted (i.e., no use of coal due to shutdowns of coal-fired power plants, and very little gas use by 2050). These methods and estimates provide a decision-making basis for government policy-making, energy planning, and technology supply for greenfield sites, as well as provide a platform to invite stakeholder engagement.

AB  - The study objective was to investigate the applicability of co-digestion and/or hydrodynamic disintegration as potential methods of methane production intensification from sewage sludge (SS) and the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) with consideration of carbon footprint (CF) assessment. Methane production was determined by means of biochemical methane potential tests. For co-digestion, the highest increase in methane production (53.8 %) was observed for the SS:OFMSW mixing ratio 40:60. Hydrodynamic disintegration at all tested energy densities (10, 30 and 60 kJ/L) caused release of soluble organic compounds from both substrates, although accelerated methane production was only observed at 10 kJ/L. An increase in methane potential for substrates disintegrated separately did not imply analogical results for the disintegration of their mixture. Within the assumed limits, CF per 1 Nm3 of produced methane, CF per 1 t of wet feedstock for the digester, and estimated CF per 1 kWh produced were also calculated. Comparable values of all indicators were obtained for monodigestion and co-digestion. The highest CF indices were achieved for monodigestion of disintegrated SS and increased significantly with applied energy density. The obtained results can serve as valuable material for operators of wastewater treatment plants facilitating the selection of sustainable methods of increasing renewable energy production.

AB  - The emphasis placed on climate change at the COP28 summit highlights the need for a deeper understanding of the factors influencing sustainable development. Therefore, this study utilizes data from 27 OECD countries from 1992 to 2020 to investigate the complex relationships among renewable energy consumption (RE), environmental regulations (ER), financial efficiency (FE), and trade-adjusted carbon emissions (CCE). Additionally, we examine the moderating role of FE in the relationship between RE and CCE. This study employs the method of moment quantile regression to demonstrate that an increase in RE and more strict ER substantially reduces CCE. Similarly, FE has a significant inverse effect on environmental degradation. Further, we observe that as RE increases, FE plays a crucial moderating role, reinforcing the inverse relationship with CCE. In the context of the COP28 summit, this study recommends that policymakers integrate renewable energy strategies with financial restructuring to facilitate sustainable economic growth amidst climate change.

AB  - Soil erosion is a major threat to soil security, and therefore to agriculture. To address this challenge, effective strategies are needed to protect soil resources without compromising crop yields. Currently, there are three main players involved: scientists, policymakers, and land managers. However, the technical knowledge required to understand how soil erosion affects food production hinders the communication of the potential benefits of soil sustainability strategies to nontechnical stakeholders, such as farmers and food producers. Moreover, a major player in this fight is still missing, consumers. If there is no connection between soil and society then the soil itself may not be valued and it is less likely to be managed sustainably. In this study, we propose the concept of soil footprint, defined as the ratio of soil loss to crop yield, to communicate, quantify, and compare soil security for different crops. It is a versatile concept that can be applied for a multitude of potential practical uses. To showcase some of these potential uses, we used national data to calculate the soil footprint of the ten main crops in Spain. We demonstrate the utility of this metric to compare and rank crops, identify problematic regions, and assess the effect of land management on the soil footprint. The soil footprint indicator offers advantages in terms of simplicity, facilitating easy calculation, comparison, and interpretation by non-technical users. This can engage society in soil conservation, empower land managers to define sustainable soil management strategies, and promote policies to enhance soil security.

AB  - The process of estimating the carbon footprint (CF) has become a key method for managing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, guiding strategies for emission reduction and validating those strategies. Given the complexity of quantifying total lifecycle emissions in residential buildings, this study delves into assessing the CF focusing on water and electricity consumption in two types of residential buildings: mainly residential villas and residential flats. This assessment was carried out in Doha City, Qatar, using data on water and electricity consumption from 2017 to 2020. The study employs the Multi-Regional Input-Output Life Cycle Assessment (MRIO-LCA) model to calculate and convert the water and electricity consumption data into the CF of these buildings. Further, the study employs various methods for statistical and spatial statistical analysis of CF emissions, including geographically weighted regression (GWR), Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), and hotspot and cold spot assessments. The annual electricity CF emissions from these buildings are approximately 7 MtCO2 equivalent, with residential villas contributing about 83% of this total. Concurrently, the annual average water CF in residential buildings is around 0.06 MtCO2 equivalent, predominantly attributed to villas. The findings highlight the substantial impact of residential structures, particularly villas, on the city's overall CF emissions. Furthermore, the findings underscore the significant impact of residential structures, especially villas, on Doha's CF emissions, revealing a marked seasonal increase, particularly during the summer months and a notable spike in 2020. The spatial analysis of CF emissions reveals consistent spatial clustering patterns across different seasons in 2020. Elevated CF emissions from villas are concentrated in Doha's central, northern, and northeastern regions, while cold spots are predominantly in the eastern and southern areas. Understanding CF in residential settings is crucial for developing strategies to reduce emissions, enhance energy efficiency, and address climate change. This research helps inform targeted interventions for more sustainable residential energy and water use, aligning with broader environmental and climate goals.

AB  - Urban ecosystems are complex systems with anthropogenic features that generate considerable CO2 emissions, which contributes to global climate change. Quantitative estimates of the carbon footprint of urban ecosystems are crucial for developing low-carbon development policies to mitigate climate change. Herein, we reviewed more than 195 urban carbon footprint and carbon footprint related studies, collated the recent progress in carbon footprint calculation methods and research applications of the urban ecosystem carbon footprint, analyzed the research applications of the carbon footprint of different cities, and focused on the need to study the urban ecosystem carbon footprint from a holistic perspective. Specifically, we aimed to: (i) compare the strengths and weaknesses of five existing carbon footprint calculation methods [life cycle assessment, input–output analysis, hybrid life cycle assessment, carbon footprint calculator, and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)]; (ii) analyze the status of current research on the carbon footprint of different urban subregions based on different features; and (iii) highlight new methods and areas of research on the carbon footprint of future urban ecosystems. Not all carbon footprint accounting methods are applicable to the carbon footprint determination of urban ecosystems; although the IPCC method is more widely used than the others, the hybrid life cycle assessment method is more accurate. With the emergence of new science and technology, quantitative methods to calculate the carbon footprint of urban ecosystems have evolved, becoming more accurate. Further development of new technologies, such as big data and artificial intelligence, to assess the carbon footprint of urban ecosystems is anticipated to help address the emerging challenges in urban ecosystem research effectively to achieve carbon neutrality and urban sustainability under global change.
Les écosystèmes urbains sont des systèmes complexes présentant des caractéristiques anthropiques qui génèrent des émissions considérables de CO2 contribuant aux changements climatiques mondiaux. Les estimations quantitatives de l’empreinte carbone des écosystèmes urbains sont cruciales pour l’élaboration de politiques de développement à faible émission de carbone visant à atténuer les changements climatiques. Dans cet article, les auteurs ont passé en revue plus de 195 études sur l’empreinte carbone urbaine et reliées à l’empreinte carbone urbaine, colligé les progrès récents en matière de méthodes de calcul de l’empreinte carbone et les applications de la recherche sur l’empreinte carbone des écosystèmes urbains, analysé les applications de recherche de l’empreinte carbone de différentes villes et mis l’accent sur la nécessité d’étudier l’empreinte carbone des écosystèmes urbains d’un point de vue holistique. Plus précisément, ils ont cherché à : (i) comparer les forces et les faiblesses de cinq méthodes existantes de calcul de l’empreinte carbone [évaluation du cycle de vie, analyse entrée-sortie, évaluation hybride du cycle de vie, calculateur de l’empreinte carbone et celle du Groupe d’experts intergouvernemental sur l’évolution du climat (GIEC)]; (ii) analyser l’état de la recherche actuelle sur l’empreinte carbone de différentes sous-régions urbaines en fonction de différentes caractéristiques; et (iii) mettre en lumière de nouvelles méthodes et de nouveaux domaines de recherche sur l’empreinte carbone des futurs écosystèmes urbains. Toutes les méthodes de comptabilisation de l’empreinte carbone ne sont pas applicables à la détermination de l’empreinte carbone des écosystèmes urbains; bien que la méthode du GIEC soit plus largement utilisée que les autres, la méthode hybride d’évaluation du cycle de vie est plus précise. Avec les avancées de la science et l’émergence de nouvelles technologies, les méthodes quantitatives de calcul de l’empreinte carbone des écosystèmes urbains ont évolué et sont devenues plus précises. Le développement ultérieur de nouvelles technologies, telles que celles qui utilisent les données massives et l’intelligence artificielle, pour évaluer l’empreinte carbone des écosystèmes urbains devrait aider à relever efficacement les nouveaux défis de la recherche sur les écosystèmes urbains afin d’atteindre la neutralité carbone et la durabilité urbaine dans le contexte des changements climatiques mondiaux.

AB  - As hydrogen is increasingly being recognized as a critical energy vector in the energy transition, capturing CO2 from existing H2 production facilities plays a significant role towards decarbonisation. Air Liquide has industrialized an innovative technology Cryocap™ H2, combining membranes and cryogenic solutions to capture CO2 most efficiently, at the lowest cost, and at a very high purity. This paper illustrates the impact of cost-effective partial capture technology choices (e.g. amine wash versus Cryocap™ H2) to CO2 emission reduction rates and overall carbon footprint. Direct and indirect emissions (i.e. Scopes 1, 2, and 3) were defined for each technology choice, alongside scenarios for low, medium, and high carbon footprint environments. The paper also explores an optimization path on the CO2 emissions reduction rate using a network configuration within a refinery. The study demonstrates that with Scope 1 emissions, the partial capture net CO2 emission reduction rate is 62% with a Cryocap™ standalone, 80% with a Cryocap™ Network, but only 56% with an amine wash due to its additional requirement of steam. Analysis of all emissions Scopes illustrates that Cryocap™ 's net CO2 emissions reduction rate ranges from 52% to 66% across low, medium, to high carbon footprint scenarios, and 39% to 44% for amine wash. The advantageous case for Cryocap™ across all three Scopes remains regardless of the additional steam production method (i.e. natural gas vs electric boiler).

AB  - Sugarcane bagasse-based cogeneration contributes significantly to bioenergy conversion in India and therefore, appropriate performance analysis is required considering the regional factors. Further increase of sugarcane bioenergy is expected in India with the Government's mandate to enhance the share of renewable energy by 2030. Herein this study, district-wise sugarcane bagasse cogeneration potential is assessed in the state Maharashtra, India. Variations in energy, carbon and water footprint of energy generated from bagasse-based cogeneration plants are also assessed for all the districts considering farm to gate attributional life cycle assessment (ALCA). Avoided product function (also called as System expansion) of simaPro 9.2 LCA software is used to assess the environmental benefits of sugarcane waste or by-products (leaves and tops, press-mud and bagasse ash). The annual bagasse production potential in Maharashtra is 19 million tonne, equivalent to 8206 GWh of cogenerated electricity. The potential varies markedly among the districts (2–1500 GWh). Nearly 81 % of cogeneration potential is concentrated in 6 districts alone. The life cycle carbon footprint (0.075–0.2 kg CO2e/kWh), the energy footprint (0.75–2.12 MJ/kWh) and the water footprint (206–516 L/kWh)-all the three estimated on the life cycle basis- differ considerably among the districts. The nexus among water, energy, and carbon footprint for sugarcane bioenergy is also analyzed to understand the complex interconnectivities among these individual resources. Cultivating high yielding varieties, use of renewable energy-based micro-irrigation, and installing modern cogeneration technology can lower the estimated carbon, energy and water footprint by up to 50 %. Such measures will help enhance farmers' income while addressing the sustainability issues in India.

AB  - ABSTRACT
It is estimated that enteric methane (CH4) contributes about 70% of all livestock greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Several studies indicated that feed additives such as 3-nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP) and nitrate have great potential to reduce enteric emissions. The objective of this study was to determine the net effects of 3-NOP and nitrate on farmgate milk carbon footprint across various regions of the United States and to determine the variability of carbon footprint. A cradle-to-farmgate life cycle assessment was performed to determine regional and national carbon footprint to produce 1 kg of fat- and protein-corrected milk (FPCM). Records from 1,355 farms across 37 states included information on herd structure, milk production and composition, cattle diets, manure management, and farm energy. Enteric CH4, manure CH4, and nitrous oxide were calculated with either the widely used Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Tier 2 or region-specific equations available in the literature. Emissions were allocated between milk and meat using a biophysical allocation method. Impacts of nitrate and 3-NOP on baseline regional and national carbon footprint were accounted for using equations adjusted for dry matter intake and neutral detergent fiber. Uncertainty analysis of carbon footprint was performed using Monte Carlo simulations to capture variability due to inputs data. Overall, the milk carbon footprint for the baseline, nitrate, and 3-NOP scenarios were 1.14, 1.09 (4.8% reduction), and 1.01 (12% reduction) kg of CO2-equivalents (CO2-eq)/kg of FPCM across US regions. The greatest carbon footprint for the baseline scenario was in the Southeast (1.26 kg of CO2-eq/kg of FPCM) and lowest for the West region (1.02 kg of CO2-eq/kg of FPCM). Enteric CH4 reductions were 12.4 and 31.0% for the nitrate and 3-NOP scenarios, respectively. The uncertainty analysis showed that carbon footprint values ranged widely (0.88–1.52 and 0.56–1.84 kg of CO2-eq/kg of FPCM within 1 and 2 standard deviations, respectively), suggesting the importance of site-specific estimates of carbon footprint. Considering that 101 billion kilograms of milk was produced by the US dairy industry in 2020, the potential net reductions of GHG from the baseline 117 billion kilograms of CO2-eq were 5.6 and 13.9 billion kilograms of CO2-eq for the nitrate and 3-NOP scenarios, respectively.

AB  - There is an urgent need to control global warming caused by humans to achieve a sustainable future. CO2 levels are rising steadily, and while countries worldwide are actively moving toward the sustainability goals proposed during the Paris Agreement in 2015, we are still a long way to go from achieving a sustainable mode of global operation. The increased popularity of cryptocurrencies since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009 has been accompanied by an increasing trend in greenhouse gas emissions and high electrical energy consumption. Popular energy tracking studies (e.g., Digiconomist and the Cambridge Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index (CBECI)) have estimated energy consumption ranges from 29.96 ​TWh to 135.12 ​TWh and 26.41 ​TWh to 176.98 ​TWh, respectively for Bitcoin as of July 2021, which are equivalent to the energy consumption of countries such as Sweden and Thailand. The latest estimate by Digiconomist on carbon footprints shows a 64.18 MtCO2 emission by Bitcoin as of July 2021, close to the emissions by Greece and Oman. This review compiles estimates made by various studies from 2018 to 2021. We compare the energy consumption and carbon footprints of these cryptocurrencies with countries around the world and centralized transaction methods such as Visa. We identify the problems associated with cryptocurrencies and propose solutions that can help reduce their energy consumption and carbon footprints. Finally, we present case studies on cryptocurrency networks, namely, Ethereum 2.0 and Pi Network, with a discussion on how they can solve some of the challenges we have identified.

AB  - The production of shale gas in China has repercussions for the global energy landscape and carbon neutrality. However, limited and threatened water resources may hinder the expansion of shale-derived natural gas, one of China's most promising development prospects. Coupling historical trends with policy guidance, we project that baseline water stress will intensify in two-thirds of China's provinces in the next decade. By 2035, annual water use for shale gas hydraulic fracturing activities is likely to increase to 16–35 million m3, with 13.8–23.7 million m3 of wastewater produced annually to extract 38–48 billion m3 of gas from ∼4800 shale gas wells. Analysis suggests that this projection is based on previously underestimated geological constraints (e.g., deep continental facies) in shale gas development in China. Nevertheless, forecasts suggest that the water footprint of shale development will become impossible to ignore, particularly in drought-stricken areas, indicating the potential risk of competition for water among shale development, domestic use, food production, and ecological protection. Meanwhile, the annual wastewater management market will increase to $0.2 billion by 2035. Our study suggests a critical need to direct attention to the (shale) energy-water nexus and develop multi-pronged policies to facilitate China's transition to carbon neutrality.

AB  - The looming climate crisis requires an immediate response, in which organizations, as major contributors, should play a central role. However, these organizations need appropriate tools to measure and mitigate their climate impacts. One commonly applied method is carbon footprint analysis. Carbon footprint analyses have been conducted for various types of organizations, but knowledge organizations, such as universities and research institutes, have received far less attention, because their carbon footprint is often less visible and can be easily underestimated. This study is based on the carbon footprint analysis of one multinational knowledge organization. This analysis then helped identify the major sources of climate impacts in other such knowledge organizations. These are mainly indirect emissions (Scope 3) and to a large extent (79%) travel-related emissions. Based on these findings, three scenarios for a post-COVID-19 world were developed and analyzed. The results from the first two scenarios showed that despite a reduction in business travel and employees working from home, Scope 3 and travel-related emissions would remain the largest contributor. Only in the unlikely case of the third, non-recovery scenario did the share of travel-related emissions drop, turning heating into the largest contributor. In addition to measuring the carbon footprint, the study discusses potential mitigation strategies knowledge organizations could apply to reduce their carbon footprint. The focus is on how to avoid and reduce emissions, but new forms of carbon offsetting are also addressed. Based on the findings, a mitigation policy framework and recommendations for further research are proposed.

AB  - Building on existing national census geographies and high-quality local bottom-up data, the Ecological Footprint is calculated for high GIS resolution Census Villages. The Calgary Urban Region case study is compared with the Kootenay Towns and Rural Region in the adjacent province. Top-down Statistics Canada villages surveyed across Canada on a five-year cycle function as the primary consumption data source. Building utilities energy, and registered vehicles fuel consumption add accuracy in quantification of Ecological Footprint housing and transportation components. Urban data is extrapolated outside the core city to evaluate regional Census Villages. This hybrid model proposes the national survey Census Villages function as the optimal Ecological Footprint geography. Top-down surveyed data supports municipal decision-making and bottom-up data extrapolated outside the core city allows precision climate action analyses and policy communications. Median household income remains a proxy and functions as the only footprint estimation for some components. Precision bottom-up data results in increased communications capabilities. The gamification of Villages is proposed to influence action on unsustainability in the promotion of thinking globally when messaging locally. This hybrid method proposes to inform and influence global sustainability via Canadian or other national similar sized survey geographies. Replication in other nations and urban contexts has potential.

AB  - The energy ecological footprint measures the environmental impact of energy consumption and is an important indicator for assessing sustainable development. This study introduced the concept of embodied carbon and developed a new energy ecological footprint accounting model. The Spatial Durbin Model was used to analyze the spillover effects of various factors influencing the energy ecological footprint. The quantile regression method was applied to examine the phased impact of each influencing factor on spatio-temporal evolution of the energy ecological footprint. A nested matrix was constructed to classify the quantile response types of each influencing factor and the spatio-temporal transition types. Additionally, a governance model for regional energy ecological footprint reduction was proposed. The results showed that: First, the spatio-temporal distribution of the energy ecological footprint of China's 29 provinces was not completely random while the energy ecological footprint of each province had significant spatial correlation characteristics. Moreover, the change of energy ecological footprint affected by its neighboring provinces. Second, industrial structure, environmental regulation, and urbanization level had a critical effect on the spatio-temporal evolution of China's energy ecological footprint. Furthermore, each factor will affect the change of the energy ecological footprint in the surrounding areas through the spatial transmission mechanism of the influencing factors, and there was a significant spatio-temporal spillover effect. Third, there were driving and constraint modes of spatio-temporal transition in the process of spatial agglomeration of energy ecological footprint in each province. Quantile regression model can well explain the driving mechanism of each driving factor on the spatio-temporal transition of energy ecological footprint, and there was a strong nesting between the quantile of driving factors at different response stages and the types of spatio-temporal transition of energy ecological footprint. These findings can serve as a basis for decision-making and help formulate targeted policies, considering the “common but differentiated” approach, to reduce China's energy ecological footprint at the provincial level.

AB  - Climate change is happening now, it is increasing presently, it is affecting us even more, and it will have a massive impact on us unless immediate and systemic action is taken to reduce and respond to its devastating consequences. One of such actions is the management of carbon emission from the construction industry, as it is one of the major sectors that contributes a substantial amount of greenhouse gases into our environment. Several efforts were made by many researchers towards developing various standards, techniques, and tools to assist in the management of the greenhouse gas emission from the industry. Some of these efforts include the green building concept itself, development of various rating systems, and sustainable construction materials. As such, this paper reviewed the several contributions of these researchers across the globe towards this dimension. And, after a thoroughly analysis of some of these contributions, it was found that there are inadequate research findings on the interconnected relationship between different drivers that are linked to low-carbon construction, highlighting the significant need for the establishment of an internationally recognized rating system under the United Nations which will include the measurements and quantification of the carbon footprint as one of its main parameters.

AB  - Analyzing the carbon footprint of crop production and proposing low-carbon emission reduction production strategies can help China develop sustainable agriculture under the goal of ‘carbon peak and carbon neutrality’. Cotton is an economically important crop in China, but few reports have systematically quantified the carbon footprint of China's cotton production and analyzed its spatiotemporal changes and driving factors. This study used a life cycle approach to analyze the spatiotemporal changes and identify the main components and driving factors of the carbon footprint of cotton production in China between 2004 and 2018 based on statistical data. The results showed that the carbon footprint per unit area of cotton in Northwest China, the Yellow River Basin and the Yangtze River Basin reached 6220.13 kg CO2eq·ha−1, 3528.14 kg CO2eq·ha−1 and 2958.56 kg CO2eq·ha−1, respectively. From 2004 to 2018, the CFa in the Yellow River Basin and Northwest China increased annually, with average increases of 59.87 kg CO2eq·ha−1 and 260.70 kg CO2eq·ha−1, respectively, while the CFa in the Yangtze River Basin decreased by an average of 21.53 kg CO2eq·ha−1 per year. The ridge regression and Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) model showed that fertilizer, irrigation electricity and agricultural film were the main influences on carbon emission growth at the micro level and that the economic factor was the key factor at the macro level. Improving the efficiency of cotton fertilization and electricity use and ensuring the high-quality development of the cotton industry are effective strategies to reduce the carbon footprint of cotton cultivation in the future. This study comprehensively uses statistical data and mathematical modeling to provide theoretical support for accounting and in-depth analysis of cotton carbon emissions. The results are valuable for policy making related to sustainable development and the low-carbon development of the Chinese cotton industry.

AB  - Food consumption decisions require consumers to evaluate the characteristics of products. However, the literature has given limited attention to how consumers determine the impact of food on health (e.g., kilocalories) and on the environment (e.g., carbon footprint). In this exercise, 1511 consumers categorised 43 food products as healthy/unhealthy and good/bad for the environment, and estimated their kilocalories and carbon footprint, which were known to the investigator. The task was performed either with no stimuli (a control group), under time pressure only, with traffic-light labels only, or both. Results show that traffic-light labels: 1) operate through improvements in knowledge, rather than facilitating information processing under pressure; 2) improve the ability to rank products by both kilocalories and carbon footprint, rather than the ability to use the metric; 3) reduce the threshold used to categorise products as unhealthy/bad for the environment, whilst raising the threshold used to classify products as good for the environment (but not healthy). Notably, traffic-light increase accuracy by reducing the response compression of the metric scale. The benefits of labels are particularly evident for carbon footprint. Overall, these results indicate that consumers struggle to estimate numerical information, and labels are crucial to ensure consumers make sustainable decisions, particularly for unfamiliar metrics like carbon footprint.

AB  - Greenhouse gas emissions are the primary cause of global warming, and active development of renewable energy has become popular in resource utilization. Wind power, as the second largest renewable energy source, plays an important role in the power industry, and clarifying the carbon footprint and carbon emission intensity of wind farms is the basis for their rational use. Although the study of the carbon footprint of wind farms has attracted considerable attention, the characteristics of the carbon footprint and carbon emission intensity of wind farms in grassland areas compared with other types of wind farms have not been determined to date. As an important part of the world's largest Eurasian grassland, the installed capacity of wind farms in the grasslands of Inner Mongolia ranks first in China. In this study, the carbon footprint of the production, transportation, construction, operation, and disposal stages was evaluated by using the life cycle assessment method in a 49.5 MW wind farm in the Inner Mongolia grassland, and its carbon emission intensity was explored in depth. The results showed the following: (1) The carbon footprint of the wind farm in the grassland area was 18701.29 t, of which the construction stage accounted for the largest proportion at 56.74%, and the other stages, ranging from highest to lowest, were production, disposal, transportation, and operation stages, which were 28.18%, 12.08%, 2.76%, and 0.24%, respectively. (2) The carbon footprint of material recycling was 18726.53 t, and the reduced carbon emissions accounted for 50.03% of the total carbon emissions. (3) The carbon emission intensity of the wind farm was 6.57 g/kWh, which is approximately 148.45 times, 72.91 times, 127.85 times, and 3.50 times less than the carbon emission intensity of the four non-renewable energy sources of coal, natural gas, oil, and nuclear power, respectively. (4) Wind power have lower carbon emission intensities than the four renewable energy sources of hydropower, biomass, and photovoltaics. This study highlights the very important role played by system boundaries when employing life cycles to evaluate carbon footprints. Compared with offshore wind farms and non-grassland wind farms, grassland wind farms have the lowest carbon emission intensity. The promotion of wind farms has excellent potential in grassland areas.

AB  - The abundant stockpiling of food waste (FW) which leads to climate change has been a growing concern over its carbon footprint (CF) in recent years. In India, student enrollment in higher education has been increasing in recent years, reaching close to 4 billion, especially in universities. The present study aims to identify varying characteristics of FW generated in a university hostel mess due to temporal and seasonal conditions. This study evaluates consumer attitudes and behaviors concerning FW, and artificial neural networks are also used to forecast the percentage of FW streams based on various characteristics. FW characters were found to vary with time and temperature. High moisture content during autumn and winter seasons was found to decrease destructible solids content, a key parameter governing biogas generation. Statistical assay of FW quantity shows that FW generation is high during the weekdays followed by Saturdays, whereas during festivals and Sundays, the generation is highly variable, which might be due to the presence of inmates during holidays. Based on data from six months sample data set, it is projected that 716.57 ​kgs of food were wasted per day with 1361.48 ​kgs carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2 eq.) related CF. It showed that parameters such as household wealth, meal contentment, meal days, education, sex, and food-saving efforts significantly impacted the CF of FW. The avoidable FW can be stopped nonetheless to prevent shadowed CF. It can be concluded that effective FW management can be done by varying number of collection points, where FW accumulation varies in a year, enabling an efficient source sorting process. This will help in transferring the FW to proper treatment and management process like anaerobic digestion and composting. The Anaerobic digestion pose an efficient methods of FW management due to its high potency in biogas production.

AB  - In China, the major water user is agriculture. Under the background of climate change and with the pressure of scarce water resources, the study of crop water footprints serves as a theoretical basis for regional optimization of water resource management, fine-tuning crop planting structures and actively addressing the negative impacts of climate change on agricultural production, among other critical issues. Leveraging meteorological and agricultural data, we employed Taiyuan which is situated in Fen River Basin as our focal research subject and calculated and analyzed the water footprint variations concerning six major food crops—wheat, corn, grain, sorghum, soybean, and potato—from 2000 to 2020. Through meticulous examination, we identified the predominant contribution of blue water (45 %) to the total water footprint, followed by green water (39 %), with grey water playing the smallest role (16 %), indicating that the use of water for crops in the Fen River Basin mainly consumes surface water and groundwater. Our investigation reveals a complementary association between blue water and green water, while both blue water and grey water exhibit an overall declining tendency from 2000 to 2020. Moreover, our predictive modeling of food crop water footprints, considering various SSPs-RCPs scenarios refered from IPCC, points towards a peak within the coming 10–20 years, with a growth rate of 16.2 % to 33.0 %, followed by a subsequent decline. Particularly, in SSP3-7.0 scenario, the water footprint of food crops presents the highest, with a growth rate of up to 33.0 % because of the continuous growth of population and the increase of crop sowing area, while in SSP1-2.6 scenario, the water footprint of food crops shows the lowest, with a growth rate of 16.2 % because of the decrease in population and crop sowing area, before the middle of the current century.

AB  - Exploring the influencing factors of the ecological footprint is a current focus. However, the impacts of globalization on the ecological footprint are inconclusive due to the complexity among variables. The objective of this paper is to investigate the effects of globalization on the ecological footprint in 35 European countries in 1970–2020. While conducting the research, causality, which goes beyond correlation, was emphasized, and the new panel noncausality test is employed. The results indicate that globalization is generally Granger-cause of the ecological footprint in European countries. Additionally, the individual causation test results also show a unidirectional causality from economic globalization to the ecological footprint, bidirectional causality between social globalization and the ecological footprint, and no causality exists between political globalization and the ecological footprint. In conclusion, this paper not only provides valuable insights into the complex dynamics between globalization and ecological footprints but also offers nuanced policy recommendations tailored to European countries. These recommendations are designed to guide them toward achieving long-term sustainability in the face of the intricate relationships between globalization and ecological footprints.

AB  - In upcoming years, the number of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices is expected to surge up to tens of billions of physical objects. However, while the IoT is often presented as a promising solution to tackle environmental challenges, the direct environmental impacts generated over the life cycle of the physical devices are usually overlooked. It is implicitly assumed that their environmental burden is negligible compared to the positive impacts they can generate. Yet, because IoT calls for a massive deployment of electronic devices in the environment, life-cycle assessment (LCA) is an essential tool to leverage in order to avoid further increasing the stress on our planet. Some general LCA methodologies for IoT already exist but quantitative results are still scarce. In this paper, we present a parametric framework based on hardware profiles to evaluate the cradle-to-gate carbon footprint of IoT edge devices. We exploit our framework in three ways. First, we apply it on four use cases to evaluate their respective production carbon footprint. Then, we show that the heterogeneity inherent to IoT edge devices must be considered as the production carbon footprint between simple and complex devices can vary by a factor of more than 150×. Finally, we estimate the absolute carbon footprint induced by the worldwide production of IoT edge devices through a macroscopic analysis over a 10-year period. Results range from 22 to 562 MtCO2-eq/year in 2027 depending on the deployment scenarios. However, the truncation error acknowledged for LCA bottom-up approaches usually lead to an undershoot of the environmental impacts. We compared the results of our use cases with the few reports available from Google and Apple, which suggest that our estimates could be revised upwards by a factor around 2× to compensate for the truncation error. Worst-case scenarios in 2027 would therefore reach more than 1000 MtCO2-eq/year. This truly stresses the necessity to consider environmental constraints when designing and deploying IoT edge devices.

AB  - Human economic activities and following carbon emissions have been recognized to be a real threat to the environment. The current levels of consumption-based carbon footprints in all developed economies grossly exceed the sustainable level. Scientists have concluded that in addition to technological solutions, downscaling of consumption and far-reaching changes in lifestyles will be needed to achieve environmental sustainability. In this study, we provide a tangible real-world example that reveals the scale of the needed change from a perspective of a European welfare state citizen. Universal basic income (UBI) represents an income that is just enough to fulfil basic needs, such as food, shelter, and medication. In our case country, Finland, UBI is in practice at the same level as the income of the lowest income decile. The purpose of this study is to present and analyse the carbon footprints at a consumption level that corresponds to UBI. We compare the carbon footprints at this low-income level to average Finnish carbon footprints and discuss their sustainability in the light of global carbon budgets. We use an input-output approach based on the Finnish ENVIMAT model. The average carbon footprint at the UBI level is 4.8 tCO2-eq and it focuses on necessities. It’s significantly lower than the average carbon footprint in Finland, 9.4 tCO2-eq, but still far from the level compatible with the current climate change mitigation targets. The results emphasize how challenging it is to find true low-carbon solutions for living in affluent countries. Lifestyle changes and technological leaps need to be combined and fostered by legislation.

AB  - Tillage methods and nitrogen (N) application are critical for soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and crop production. However, both tillage and N are the main contributors to the carbon footprint (CF) in agricultural production. A 6-year-long field experiment was conducted under a winter wheat-summer maize cropping system in Northern China to test how tillage methods (RT, annual rotary tillage; DT, annual deep tillage; and TT, RT applied annually with a DT interval of two years) and N rates (300 kg ha–1, N300; 225 kg ha–1, N225; 165 kg ha–1, N165) affect SOC sequestration, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and annual grain yield. And, the CF was used to evaluate ecological sustainability. RT preferentially sequestrated SOC in the 0–10 cm soil layer. In the 10–30 cm soil layers, 2.87–3.82 and 1.85–2.53 Mg ha–1 greater SOC were respectively observed under DT and TT than RT, which was conducive to maximizing annual grain yield with less N application (N225) relative to traditional farming practice (RT-N300). Both increasing N rate and deep tillage resulted in obvious increases in the total GHG emissions. N fertilizer production and transportation were the greatest contributors, accounting for 40.4–47.0% of the total GHG emissions, followed by direct N2O and CH4 emissions (23.5–30.5%). TT-N225 significantly reduced CF (CF including SOC sequestration was 0.49 Mg CO2 eq ha–1 year–1 lower than DT-N225, and was 1.87 Mg CO2 eq ha–1 year–1 lower than RT-N300) and maintained high crop productivity while creating appropriate soil conditions and thus may be a much cleaner agricultural strategy in Northern China. And, the strategy of reducing N application in agricultural production by improving soil properties of the plow layer in this study can also be referred to in other ecological regions.

AB  - The UK National Health Service (NHS) aims to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. One measure for reaching this target outlined in the NHS long-term plan (2019) is to reduce the carbon footprint of inhalational anaesthetic gases (IAGs). We modelled the synthesis of commonly used IAGs - sevoflurane, isoflurane, and desflurane - in comparison to intravenous propofol and estimated the carbon footprint generated throughout their lifetime, from manufacturing of raw materials to emissions of IAGs vented from operating theatres. We find that the carbon footprint of IAGs varies significantly depending on the method of chemical synthesis. Our results indicate that the carbon footprint of IAGs is minimised when using oxygen/air mix as the carrier gas at the lowest flow rate while applying a vapour capture technology (VCT). In this scenario, the carbon footprint of sevoflurane per minimum alveolar concentration hour is similar to that of propofol, which is a significant finding given that previous studies have favoured propofol as a means of carbon footprint reduction and only the active pharmaceutical ingredient of propofol was examined. Further, we show that the carbon footprint of sevoflurane used in the NHS during 2018, in the absence of VCTs, is not smaller than that of desflurane if sevoflurane is synthesised from tetrafluoroethylene. Therefore, to reduce the carbon footprint of IAGs, this study supports the continued reduction in the use of nitrous oxide and recommends a wider adoption of VCTs.

AB  - Significant environmental impacts of multinational enterprises (MNEs) are beyond firms and countries because of their cross-border production-sharing activities. In this paper, we trace MNEs’ carbon footprints (CFs) to the upstream along global value chains (GVCs) and analyze the driving factors that lead to changes in MNEs’ CFs through hierarchical structural decomposition analysis. Our findings show that the distribution of MNEs’ CFs is highly consistent with the distribution of their GVC production networks, where these CFs are mainly concentrated in advanced economies, and emerging markets and developing economies only account for a small but gradually increasing share. Further, MNEs’ CFs are mainly attributed to medium high/high-tech manufacturing, especially in emerging markets and developing economies, where over one-half of these firms’ CFs are generated in computer, electronics and optical products and motor vehicle production. Finally, we analyze the different impacts of changes in the emissions of domestic-owned enterprises, foreign-invested enterprises in host countries and emissions generated abroad on MNEs’ CFs as well as the main driving factors leading to these changes in the US, Germany, China, India, Mexico and Singapore. Our findings provide support for MNEs’ whole global-value-chain emission control to realize global carbon neutrality and shed light on possible pathways for mitigating the domestic carbon emissions of economies that are deeply integrated into GVCs.

AB  - Biojet fuel is a low carbon alternative to fossil jet fuel. There is limited literature on life cycle environmental performance of biojet fuel from 2nd generation biomass feedstocks. This work (i) assesses biojet fuel potential from rice, wheat, jute and potato residues in Bangladesh, and (ii) conducts farm to factory gate attributional Life Cycle Assessment of biojet fuel. Different scenarios suggest Bangladesh can produce 1074 to 2548 million liters of biojet fuel annually, with 1810 million liters per annum being the most optimistic potential. This is 4.5 times higher than the current jet fuel demand of the country. Carbon, energy, and landuse footprints of biojet fuel are lower than fossil jet fuel, however, water footprint is higher. Energy Return on Investment (EROI) of biojet fuel ranges from 1.60 to 1.78. The results will contribute to UN SDGs 7 & 13 and biojet fuel development in Bangladesh.

AB  - The significant achievements in economic growth and urbanization in China have recently led to substantial increases of and great inequality in household carbon footprints (HCFs). To achieve efficiency and justice in emissions reduction, policymakers need to fully understand the sources of HCFs and identify the major causes of carbon inequality. By applying the Unconditional Quantile Regression (UQR) model and decomposition method to the Chinese household survey data, this paper investigates the distributional features of HCFs and their determinants. We find that HCFs are unevenly distributed due to differences in the volume and pattern of consumption, which are further determined by household characteristics and lifestyles. The intertemporal lifestyle changes have played a major role in the rise of HCFs inequality measured by various quantile emissions differentials. In addition, considerable increases in HCFs come from the high carbon emission groups, and most of the HCFs inequality stems from the 90–50 emissions differential. To transform the current carbon-intensive economy, policies are required to enhance environmental equity and encourage low-carbon lifestyles.

AB  - Constant emission factors to assess the carbon footprint of buildings energy use, as usually included in national Building Technical Codes, show their limitations since the electrical grid mix changes constantly. For this reason, hourly-based methods using time-varying penalty signals to calculate carbon emissions and primary energy use in buildings constitute more effective assessment methods, especially with the aim to activate energy flexibility in buildings based on those inputs. Such signals have been developed and tested in the present work. The robustness and effectiveness of the methods is tested throughout two study cases. The first case compares the impact of using hourly signals over constant factors from the standards. For that purpose, a measured aggregated consumption profile corresponding to 226 real households is analyzed. In the second study case, demand response is implemented through control strategies reacting to the hourly penalty signals, aiming to decrease the emissions, primary energy use and cost. Results for the first case reveal that hourly rates better capture the variability of the electric grid compared to constant yearly factors from national standards, with a 50% difference in carbon emissions and a 20% overestimation with primary energy. Results from the second study case show how the implemented modulation strategies offer benefits in the flexible scenarios compared to the base scenarios, in terms of accumulated emissions or primary energy. Improvements are especially perceived when splitting data seasonally and considering periods with higher demand. Furthermore, this study provides insights for developing energy flexibility inputs when assessing the building performance during critical events such as the COVID19 pandemic or extreme weather conditions, where hourly and seasonal variation might have greater impact. Demand response mechanisms as energy flexibility strategies studied through this work might help in the reduction of total emissions and primary energy. Depending if the goal is to shift the demand due to environmental or economical reasons, different modulation strategies can be implemented to reach greater benefits.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Background
Human food systems substantially affect the environment, but the impacts vary widely by food. Guidance to individuals to reduce their dietary impacts would benefit from easy advice, but little is known about the specific population impacts of simple changes on self-selected diets.
Objectives
The objective was to estimate the potential impact of a single dietary substitution on the carbon and water scarcity footprints of self-selected diets in the United States.
Methods
This cross-sectional modeling study used 24-h dietary recall data from the 2005–2010 waves of the NHANES. Greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) in the production of foods as well as irrigated water use, characterized by its relative scarcity at production locations, were matched to all foods in the recalls using previously developed databases. Impacts were summed to create carbon and water scarcity footprints for diets (n = 16,800) of adults aged >18 y. Diet quality was assessed using the Healthy Eating Index (HEI). Foods with the highest impact on GHGE and selected additional foods were substituted for calorically equivalent, less impactful items. Footprints were calculated before and after these hypothetical substitutions.
Results
The highest impact foods were all beef items, and 19.8% of individuals consumed them (n = 3320). After substitution of these items with poultry or pork, the mean carbon and water scarcity footprints among those with substitutions significantly decreased (P < 0.001) by 48.4 ± 0.6% and 29.9 ± 0.4%, respectively. Across the entire sample, these represented mean reductions of 9.6 ± 0.3% and 5.9 ± 0.2%, respectively. The mean HEI after substitutions was 3.6 ± 0.1% higher than before (P < 0.001). None of the selected additional foods had population impacts as large as the beef substitutions.
Conclusions
Simple substitutions can be made in individuals’ diets to substantially reduce their carbon and water scarcity footprints without sacrificing dietary quality. Such substitutions may be easier to promote than complex dietary patterns.

AB  - ABSTRACT
In the rapidly progressing field of telemedicine, there is a multitude of evidence assessing the effectiveness and financial costs of telemedicine projects; however, there is very little assessing the environmental impact despite the increasing threat of the climate emergency. This report provides a systematic review of the evidence on the carbon footprint of telemedicine. The identified papers unanimously report that telemedicine does reduce the carbon footprint of healthcare, primarily by reduction in transport-associated emissions. The carbon footprint savings range between 0.70–372 kg CO2e per consultation. However, these values are highly context specific. The carbon emissions produced from the use of the telemedicine systems themselves were found to be very low in comparison to emissions saved from travel reductions. This could have wide implications in reducing the carbon footprint of healthcare services globally. In order for telemedicine services to be successfully implemented, further research is necessary to determine context-specific considerations and potential rebound effects.
