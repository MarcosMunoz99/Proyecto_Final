JOUR,Decoupling trend and drivers between grain water‑carbon footprint and economy-ecology development in China,"['Sun, Jingxin', 'Sun, Shikun', 'Yin, Yali', 'Wang, Yubao', 'Zhao, Jinfeng', 'Tang, Yihe', 'Wu, Pute']",Agricultural Systems,217,103904,2024,2024/05/01/,0308-521X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2024.103904,['https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X24000544'],"['Grain water‑carbon footprint', 'Economy-ecology', 'Decoupling assessment', 'Tapio decoupling model', 'Decoupling drivers', 'LMDI model']","CONTEXT Agriculture is not only the basic guarantee for human survival, but also the basis for the economy development and ecology construction. Water use and carbon emissions in grain production will largely determine China's transition to “green”. OBJECTIVE On the basis of finding out how much water is consumed and how much carbon is emitted by grain cultivation, and then finding out whether and what extent water use and carbon emissions affect economic-ecological development in China. METHODS This study uses the Tapio decoupling model to calculate the decoupling status of the grain water‑carbon footprint and economic-ecological development in mainland China from 1998 to 2020. Then the Logarithmic Mean Division Index (LMDI) model is used to analyze the drivers of the change of water-economy decoupling status. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS The results show that the grain water‑carbon footprint is well decoupled from economic development, most decoupling states are absolute decoupling (−3<e<0) and relative decoupling ① (0<e<1). The grain water‑carbon footprint decoupled from ecological development is weak, and the decoupling coefficient has significant spatio-temporal differences. The agricultural production technology is the main positive driver for the decoupling between grain water footprint and economic development in mainland China (−1<eB<0). And the economic development scale is the main restraining factor for the decoupling between grain water footprint and economic development (0<eC<1). All provinces in mainland China need to correctly handle the relationship between economy-ecology development and grain security, and take water conservation and carbon emission reduction as an important starting point for adjusting the industrial structure, so as to achieve “green” development. SIGNIFICANCE The grain water‑carbon footprint was calculated in an integrated manner, and then based on the calculation of the decoupling situation, the drivers of the decoupling situation were further assessed.",,,

There is a need to identify energy and carbon efficient cropping systems that reduce GHG emission and improve environmental quality. Using life cycle assessment (LCA), we evaluated the four cropping systems namely fallow – chickpea (F–C); Sesbania – mustard (Ses–M); blackgram – chickpea (B–C); sorghum + cowpea – mustard (S + C–M) cultivated during the 2018–2022 period. The energy use pattern and the input-output relationship were analysed. Three measures were utilized to quantify carbon footprints: CFa, which denotes emissions per unit area; CFb, indicating emissions per kilogram of yield; and CFe, representing emissions per unit of economic output. The result indicates that non-renewable sources of energy (diesel and fertilizer) contributed more than ∼80 % of the total energy consumed in the different cropping systems. The total energy requirement was the highest for S + C–M (16,972 MJ ha–1), followed by Ses–M (14,365 MJ ha–1), B–C (11,132 MJ ha–1) and F–C (8679 MJ ha–1) cropping systems. The S + C–M cropping system also had the highest energy use efficiency (9.13) followed by F–C (6.03), B–C (5.41) and Ses–M (5.41). The fallow–chickpea cropping system had the lowest values of CFa, CFb, and CFe however, the highest carbon efficiency (10.7) and the carbon sustainability index (9.7) were computed in S + C–M cropping system. Our findings indicate that thoughtfully structured, varied crop systems that integrate legumes and forage crops have the potential to significantly reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions, while sustaining or potentially improving overall productivity within these systems.",,,

The relative lack of carbon footprint analyses of urban public transportation systems (UPTS) is therefore surprising, given that UPTS is an important component of urban transportation and one that may play a crucial role in carbon emission reduction. This study conducts a spatio-temporal analysis of carbon footprints for UPTS during the COVID-19 pandemic based on smart card data in Beijing. Since the core of carbon footprint calculation is to estimate travellers' trip trajectories and the ridership of urban rail transit (URT) and buses, we construct a novel multi-layer urban rail network model to calculate passenger volume and travellers' trajectories through a traffic assignment model. Furthermore, we utilize the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to analyse the correlation relationship between the carbon footprints of buses and URT. Additionally, we conduct statistical analysis of the carbon footprint of UPTS. The results of the spatio-temporal analysis of carbon footprints for UPTS show significantly lower carbon emissions during holidays compared to those on working days, and emissions during peak hours contribute approximately half of the total daily UPTS emissions, while there are notable variations in the distribution of the carbon footprint among different districts. Moreover, our analysis reveals a positive correlation between the carbon footprints of buses and URT. The statistical analysis reflects different patterns of carbon footprint distribution on different dates during the pandemic, but the carbon footprint distributions on selected dates all follow a power-law distribution. This study may facilitate the understanding to the impacts of UPTS on the environment during the COVID-19 pandemic, and also provide important guidance and reference for the development of carbon emission reduction strategies.",,,

With growing concerns over climate change and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the transition to electric vehicles and clean energy sources has gained significant attention as potential solutions. This research investigates the relationship between the adoption of EVs and clean energy technologies and their subsequent effect on carbon footprints. The study applied the Generalised Method Moments (GMM) on the data sourced from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the World Development Indicators (WDI) for the period 2011–2021 covering 27 countries. The findings reveal a strong correlation between the adoption of EVs and reductions in carbon footprints. It shows that a 1 % increase in renewable electricity output would result in a 0.5 % decline in carbon footprints. This implies that, as EV sales increase, the overall carbon emissions from the transportation sector decrease, primarily due to the lower emissions associated with electric vehicles compared to conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. Additionally, the study finds that the integration of clean energy sources into the electricity grid further contributes to carbon footprint reductions. The use of renewable energy in charging EVs minimizes the indirect emissions associated with electricity generation. The research concludes that the widespread adoption of EVs and clean energy sources has the potential to significantly reduce carbon footprints and mitigate the impact of climate change. However, it emphasizes the importance of continued technological advancements, increased availability of charging infrastructure, and supportive government policies to accelerate the transition towards a low-carbon transportation and energy system. Therefore, the study highlights the need for collaborative efforts among governments, industry stakeholders, and individuals to foster sustainable practices and achieve a more environmentally friendly future.",,,
JOUR,Life cycle carbon footprint accounting of an offshore wind farm in Southeast China—Simplified models and carbon benchmarks for typhoons,"['Sun, Zhen', 'You, Xianhui']",Applied Energy,355,122267,2024,2024/02/01/,0306-2619,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.122267,['https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261923016318'],"['Offshore wind farms', 'Carbon footprint accounting', 'Typhoons', 'Simplified models', 'Carbon benchmarks']","Offshore wind farms are fast-spreading off the southeast coast of China to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. However, unfavorable weather conditions in Southeast China (e.g. frequent typhoons and severe wind intermittency) may increase the carbon footprint of offshore wind energy. But typhoons have never been considered in carbon accounting before, which may affect the design decisions of stakeholders and research priority setting for academicians. (i) To determine the effect of typhoons on carbon footprint, a life cycle assessment was performed on a typical offshore wind farm using real data. The results demonstrate that typhoons can be the largest contributor to carbon footprint, and the maximum wind speed of typhoons is the most critical parameter to carbon footprint. (ii) To quantify the carbon emissions caused by typhoons, simplified models estimating carbon emission intensity under different maximum wind speeds of typhoons are established, using Monte Carlo method based on 51 historical typhoons. The models imply that wind turbines with Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) are highly recommended in typhoon-prone area, because their carbon footprint is smaller than those with Doubly-Fed Induction Generator (DFIG). (iii) To set carbon benchmarks for typhoons, statistic analysis was conducted based on the simulated samples generated by Monte Carlo method. The carbon benchmarks of typhoons show that gearbox has the highest carbon emission intensity (mean=4.35g/kW, 95th percentile=7.00g/kW) among all components, resulting DFIG with gearbox not suitable in typhoon-areas. The site selection of offshore wind farms in Southeast China should avoid areas where the maximum wind speed of typhoons exceeds 44.5 m/s. This study emphasizes the importance of typhoons in carbon footprint accounting for offshore wind farms in Southeast China. More significantly, the proposed simplified models and carbon benchmarks of typhoons can be applied to feasibility studies in early design stage for engineers and stakeholders.",,,

This paper empirically explores the relationship between individual carbon footprints and carbon literacy as well as socio-economic and attitudinal factors. To operationalize carbon literacy, we distinguish between carbon knowledge and carbon engagement. Our econometric analysis uses widely representative survey data for 1000 individuals in Germany and distinguishes between components of an aggregate carbon footprint and of carbon footprints related with electricity consumption, heating, motorized individual transport, aviation, and dietary choices. We find a negative and sizeable correlation between carbon engagement and the aggregate footprint, as well as the footprints related to electricity consumption and diet. For example, a one-unit increase in our index reflecting carbon engagement corresponds to a decrease in the aggregate carbon footprint of about 4%. Furthermore, for carbon knowledge we find a negative correlation with the carbon footprint from diet. We also find significant correlations between the carbon footprints and gender, age, income, education, environmental preferences, and policy orientation, which generally exhibit the intuitively expected signs, but differ somewhat across activities. Overall, our findings support the notion that fostering carbon engagement represents a more effective strategy for reducing individuals' carbon footprints than enhancing carbon knowledge.",,,

As oil fields approach their expected service life and reach depletion, energy use and GHG emissions increase per unit of produced oil, shifting operations away from their optimal point. Thus, it is paramount that oil field life extension decisions account for energy use and GHG emissions. However, many facilities are having their service life extended without considering this energy inefficiency and previous life extension decision making studies have neglected GHG emissions. Addressing this issue, this paper proposes the inclusion of a carbon footprint assessment within the evaluation of oil and gas offshore production facility life extension. The carbon footprint assessment adds an environmental lens to the evaluation of ageing, formerly evaluated according to material degradation, obsolescence and organizational issues. An eleven-stage framework is proposed to systematize the ageing related carbon footprint assessment and support life extension decision-making: (1) Objective definition, (2) Scope definition, (3) Field conditions description, (4) Scope breakdown into manageable portions, (5) Detailed data collection for each process and subsystem, (6) Input and output definition for each process and subsystem, (7) Process modelling, (8) Methodology definition for energy demand and inefficiency estimate, (9) Monitoring indicator definition, (10) Performance evaluation, and (11) Interpretation of results. The proposed framework is applied to a hypothetical case study, developed with data from a typical oil and gas offshore production platform operated in Brazil. Two LE improvement strategies were simulated, i.e. reducing the number of gas turbines, and increasing the export of natural gas. Both alter the modus operandi of the compression system and do not require additional equipment installation. These strategies resulted in a combined reduction of 922,000 tCO2 during the extended 10-year operation. This outcome demonstrates that by applying the framework opportunities for reducing energy use and GHG emissions during life extension can be identified and quantified, facilitating life extension decision-making.",,,

This expansion offers promising prospects for advancing environmental sustainability through green finance, which can be an excellent tool. In this respect, this research examines how green finance affects the carbon footprint in BRICS+6 economies. Earlier studies used panel data techniques to probe the association between these variables but overlooked that certain countries still needed to possess such a link separately. Hence, this research adopts the Quantile-on-Quantile approach, which provides a holistic universal view and customized findings for each country. The outcomes display that green finance improves environmental quality by diminishing carbon footprint at distinct quantiles of data distribution.",2,375,

There are many issues that need to be discussed and solved in the carbon footprint accounting of wool products. In this paper, key issues such as system boundary, calculation method, accounting data, and allocation method are analyzed and discussed to accurately account for the carbon footprint of wool products. The results show that when accounting for the partial carbon footprint of wool products, the system boundary endpoint of the “gate” is more operable. The model estimation method used to calculate the carbon footprint of sheep rumination needs further improvement in feed intake prediction and methane conversion coefficient. Clarifying the carbon sequestration and carbon transfer mechanism and accurately tracing the source of carbon elements in wool can quantify the carbon sequestration effect of wool products. The data should be prioritized in the order of site-specific data, primary data, and secondary data. The protein mass allocation method can better allocate wool and co-products in the raw material production stage. A full and systematic analysis of the key issues of the carbon footprint accounting for wool products can ensure the effectiveness and comparability of the carbon footprint accounting results and contribute to the green and low-carbon development of the wool industry.",,,

Assessments of both producer (upstream) and consumer (downstream) ecological and socioeconomic impacts of urban inter-industry exchanges are needed to reduce energy consumption and resource use behind the industrial footprints of cities. Environmental extensions in the input-output analysis are designed from the user side perspective, focusing only on commercial energy supply and use. This study introduced emergy-evaluated supply-extended and use-extended carbon footprint models for Vienna and compared their empirical and conceptual implications. Emergy-evaluated footprints of Vienna's urban consumption were estimated by combining industrial and systems ecology approaches as per the research question, based on previous investigations of GHG emissions and energy supply- and use-extensions. Results showed that the ranking of footprints of final product categories is sensitive to the evaluation method, with products of extractive and manufacturing industries differing by more than 10% depending on whether emergy or carbon evaluation is chosen. The emergy-based comparison further reveals that for products of extractive industries, the difference between use and supply extension results can be more than 20% as opposed to carbon-based comparison with the difference between supply and use extension results for services not even amounting to 5%. Future studies could address the over-estimation of direct energy supply to the economy, under-estimation of product and service, inconsistency in standard use-extension design, and challenges in assembling emergy-evaluated supply and use extensions.

The learning model utilizes the boundary representation of CAD models for deeper understandings of the CAD model shape. The proposed method trains the deep learning model on the existing CAD models to recognize important sub-shapes and attributes, including materials and manufacturing information, such as welded parts, which are the essential data for the carbon footprint estimation. The proposed method enables the designers to estimate the carbon footprint without the laborious condition setting, which facilitates concurrent monitoring and improvement of the carbon footprint.

Utilizing instrumental regression analysis, it examines the consensus mechanisms—Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS)—and their association with carbon footprint. The findings reveal a clear correlation between the adoption of PoW-based cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and carbon emissions. Notably, PoW-based cryptocurrencies generate approximately 0.86 metric tons of carbon emissions per transaction, which is significantly higher than PoS-based transactions like Ethereum. Concerns also arise regarding the sustainability of Bitcoin mining after the fourth halving period and potential shortages in PoW-based mining resources. As mining rewards decrease, the challenge of timely block creation intensifies. By projecting future BTC mining phases, the study anticipates diminishing rewards in each halving period, potentially leaving around 2500 BTC units available for mining by 2120. This suggests that achieving the full 21 million BTC may prove practically unattainable within the current blockchain framework. Furthermore, the research highlights the speculative and risky nature of cryptocurrencies lacking regulatory oversight, which tends to attract irresponsible investors. It stresses the importance of developing a nuanced understanding of the environmental implications of PoW cryptocurrencies and advocating for responsible innovation.

This initiative aims to usher consumers towards more environmentally-conscious purchasing decisions by providing insights into the ecological impact of their food choices. Our comprehensive research explores a variety of determinants that sway Taiwanese consumers in their buying behaviors, specifically focusing on the influence of these carbon footprint labels. Surprisingly, while one might anticipate media exposure to be a dominant force in shaping opinions, our findings suggest its role remains relatively limited in this context. Instead, personal experiences with climate events and robust influences from family and peers emerge as the primary drivers in purchasing decisions. These direct interpersonal interactions, both in terms of shared experiences and word-of-mouth recommendations, offer profound insights into shaping consumer behavior. As Taiwan ambitiously targets net-zero emissions by 2050, harnessing the power of these social dynamics becomes imperative.

Based on 454 farm surveys on the North and Northeast China Plain, the carbon footprint (CF) of two farmland ecosystems (irrigated system for wheat and maize on the North China Plain and rainfed system for maize on the Northeast Plain) were assessed and emission reduction pathways explored by quantifying greenhouse gas emissions of agricultural inputs and farm practices during the entire crop growing seasons with an agricultural footprint model. The results demonstrated that the GHG emissions from wheat and maize rotation in the irrigated system were 7.63 t CO2 eq ha−1 and 3.17 t CO2 eq ha−1 for single season maize in the rainfed system. While energy consumption accounted for 12.5%–21.3% of the carbon footprint in both systems, the group assessment found that the largest difference in GHG emissions between the high and low emission groups came from mechanical energy consumption. Approximately 50.6% and 39.2% of the mechanical carbon footprint of wheat and maize, respectively, were caused by irrigation practices in the irrigated system. Regarding the rainfed system, where 46.6% of mechanical carbon emissions were generated by maize tillage operations. In addition, scenario analysis indicated that the mechanical carbon footprint could be reduced to 56 kg CO2 eq t−1 for NCP-wheat and 26 kg CO2 eq t−1 for NCP-maize, respectively, by optimizing yields and irrigation practices in irrigated systems and that the mechanical carbon footprint of NEP-maize could be reduced to 25 kg CO2 eq t−1 by optimizing yields and tillage practices in rainfed systems. Therefore, improvement in mechanization in irrigation and tillage practices can contribute to reduce GHG emissions in China.

The carbon footprint for craft brewing was calculated for a wide range of packaging types across three realistic scenarios (low, medium, and high carbon footprints) based on collected data and addresses the discrepancies between values reported in previous literature. Overall, the calculated carbon footprints ranged between 205 (20 L steel kegs, low carbon footprint scenario) and 1483 (single-use, 0.33 L glass bottles, high carbon footprint scenario) gCO2e per litre of beer. Novel hotspots (including wort boiling, the packaging process in a brewery, and the contribution of secondary and tertiary packaging) were identified. The overwhelming contribution of Scope 3 emissions (contributing between 57 and 95 % of the total carbon footprint) further emphasised the need to provide increased knowledge to craft breweries.",,,

The stated choice experiment, used for evaluation, was designed combining a set of alternatives, characterised by carbon footprint reduction and offset policies, taking into account the existence of environmental direct benefits, but also indirect benefits that improve tourist experience or co-benefits derived from the location of policy projects. Economic welfare in form of willingness to pay (WTP) was estimated, and the alternatives were compared using compensating variation values. The study's findings validate the prevailing preference for carbon reduction policies over offsetting measures, except when the first don't have co-benefits and the latter are implemented locally. In the latter case, there is no significant difference in WTP between reducing the carbon footprint and locally offsetting it.

Notably, we determine that the ecological footprint across sectors and countries is diverging, or at best, slowly converging at a pace that is not even close to that required to meet the 2030 SDGs. Therefore, policymakers and practitioners must strategically revise sustainability policies to ensure industrial and economic transition and adaptability to climate change and advance economic green growth and sustainable development.",,,

We have developed an algorithm for a dynamic estimation of these fluxes based on a net production DEB growth model for mussels. The resulting model has been implemented in Python to create a toolbox with a graphical user interface. This toolbox allows the selection of different culture strategies, in terms of seeding date, seed size and culture length, and consequently analyzes the carbon footprint and impact on the carbonate chemistry of seawater of aquaculture management.",,,

Here, we explore the limitations of this proportionality assumption. We provide a systematic framework for discussing the gap between the true carbon footprint and the carbon footprint imputed with spending, a framework which is valid for any type of footprint. We show that two channels can bias the distribution of the carbon footprint: the heterogeneity in prices paid and the heterogeneity in the carbon intensity of products purchased. We rely on French household budget survey data to illustrate how these channels operate and interplay, and use cooking oils as a case study of the interplay of the two channels. We find that wealthier households pay higher prices. Because of the price heterogeneity, the carbon footprint tends to be overestimated for top income and underestimated at the bottom. We also use consumption of cooking oils as a more-in depth case study of the carbon intensity heterogeneity. This case shows that it can lead to an outcome similar to price heterogeneity.",,,

Thus, this study utilizes the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) method to explore the impact of electricity intensity (EINT), renewable energy in electricity generation (ERE), and gross domestic product (GDP) on Malaysia's environmental quality, from 1985 to 2020. By using carbon emissions (CO2 emissions) and ecological footprint (EF) as proxies, the study finds a significant long-run impact of these factors on environmental degradation. Notably, the study also observed an inverted U-shaped relationship between GDP and environmental degradation, validating the existence of Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. The findings also imply that while electricity intensity is associated with increased emissions, the use of renewable energy (RE) sources for electricity generation may contribute to emission reduction. But the results for both variables show reversal signs on EF. The study's adoption of the fully ordinary least square (FMOLS) method reinforces the same results, thus, justifying the cointegrating relationship between studied variables. Drawing from these outcomes, the study advocates for a comprehensive approach to renewable energy management, emphasizing both its utilization and waste in order to improve ecological footprint.

The high cost of evaluating pruning quantities by destructive measurements has limited the research on pruning. By combining terrestrial laser scanning and quantitative structure models, pruning quantities can be assessed non-destructively. This study focuses on the impact of pruning during tree production, as it is intense and has been rarely evaluated. Using Sophora japonica from a nursery in Beijing as an example, point cloud data were collected from 181 uneven-aged Sophora japonica for the simulation of pruning at a single tree level. All pruning stages were incorporated into the assessment of the carbon footprint of Sophora japonica production for 15-year-old trees. The results show that previous studies have underestimated the tree carbon footprints of pruning, leading to a severe underestimation of the carbon footprint of tree production. Crown reduction removes the most above-ground woody biomass during tree production, over half, while the decomposition of pruning waste is the most significant source of carbon emissions. The removal ratio from pruning of individual trees is consistent within the same pruning pattern. The tree volume can serve as a good predictor for estimating pruning quantities, but crown diameter sometimes needs to be considered. Implementing pruning interventions, harvesting in advance, and choosing appropriate methods for pruning waste disposal can reduce carbon emissions from pruning.",,,

Three DCAs were modified into two distinct particle groups through sieving: fine particles for cement replacement, evaluated against a ternary cementitious binder with fly ash (FA) and flue gas desulfurization gypsum (FG) using Response surface methodology (RSM), and coarse particles for aggregate treatment. The modified DCA mixes and conventional cement-treated base (CTB) mix were compared for environmental and economic benefits through cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment. The results indicate that replacing fine DCA optimized setting time and compressive strength based on its chemical composition, aligning with FA and FG in the RSM process. A 25 % cement replacement with fine DCA balanced the mechanical properties of the modified cement, while a 50 % replacement with coarse DCA effectively improved aggregate properties compared to natural crushed rock. Modified DCA enhanced pavement engineering properties, surpassing the strength and resilience benchmarks of CTB mix. Utilizing optimal modified DCA mixes could reduce carbon footprint and costs by approximately 40 % and 44 %, respectively. Hence, the outcomes highlight challenges and opportunities for modifying DCA for resource conservation and low-carbon transportation infrastructure.",,,

Understanding the factors driving this phenomenon is crucial for mitigating the carbon footprint of agricultural production. Nevertheless, comprehending the carbon flow of the agricultural industry within China remained insufficient. Furthermore, quantifying the driving forces behind ACF and carbon flow for a single year posed a significant challenge. In this study, we aim to uncover the distribution and flow pattern of the carbon footprint in China's agricultural industry using a multi-regional input-output model. Moreover, we introduce a novel approach by employing geographical detectors to analyze the influencing factors from a spatial heterogeneity perspective. The results reveal that China's ACF in 2015 amounted to 48,826.69 thousand tons of carbon equivalents (CO2eq). The ACF was generally higher in the northern regions and lower in the central areas. A Jevons paradox phenomenon was observed in Shandong, where ACF was higher, and agricultural carbon emission intensity was lower, suggesting that improvements in agricultural efficiency can paradoxically lead to increased carbon emissions. Notably, 39.39% of ACF was involved in regional transfers. The primary flow of agricultural carbon occurred from northern to southeastern coastal areas, with Guangdong (4447.49 thousand tons of CO2eq) and Heilongjiang (−2225.25 thousand tons of CO2eq) being the leading inflow and outflow provinces, respectively. Socioeconomic and agricultural factors played a significant role in shaping the distribution of ACF and its inter-regional transmission. Socioeconomic factors, including GDP, population, industry structure, and educational expenditure, predominantly influenced inflow ACF. Meanwhile, agricultural factors related to land use and grain output primarily affected outflow ACF. Suggestions for reducing carbon footprint in the agricultural sector was proposed based on the condition of ACF and flow types, from the production and consumption aspects. Provinces of ACF inflow and outflow should share the responsibility for reducing ACF, potentially through carbon trading and reciprocal technological assistance. This study offers substantial theoretical value by providing a comprehensive understanding of the spatial flow and driving factors of ACF within China's agricultural sector.",,,

However, achieving effluent discharge standards often requires considerable energy and chemical consumption during operation, resulting in significant carbon footprints. In this study, GHG emissions are systematically accounted for, and the driving factors of carbon footprint growth in China’s MWWTPs are explored. In 2020, a total of 41.9 million tons (Mt) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) were released by the sector, with nearly two-thirds being indirect emissions resulting from energy and material usage. The intensity of electricity, carbon source, and phosphorus removing agent consumption increasingly influence carbon footprint growth over time. Through statistical inference, benchmarks for electricity and chemical consumption intensity are established across all MWWTPs under various operational conditions, and the potential for mitigation through more efficient energy and material utilization is calculated. The results suggest that many MWWTPs offer significant opportunities for emission reduction. Consequently, empirical decarbonization measures, including intelligent device control, optimization of aeration equipment, energy recovery initiatives, and other enhancements to improve operational and carbon efficiency, are recommended.",,,

Awareness of carbon sources and quantification of the waste are two key parameters. To our knowledge, there is no study in France on waste production by the surgical team during the operation in orthopedic surgery, in a global scope. Therefore, we performed an observational investigation aiming to: (1) quantify and characterize the weight of the wastes generated after a panel of orthopedic procedures, (2) calculate the CO2 footprint generated by these wastes and extrapolate the figure at the national scale. Hypothesis Waste production is highly variable according to the types of procedures and infectious clinical waste is still a predominant source of waste and CO2 emission. Materials and methods It is a comparative and prospective study in which a total of 14 procedures were selected as a representative panel: arthroplasties (hip, knee), spine fusions, arthroscopic procedures (shoulder, knee), nerve release, forefoot osteotomies, trauma procedures. The main outcome was the average total weight of waste for each of the fourteen categories (280 measurements: 140 times 2, at the end of each procedure), expressed in kilograms (kg), and the proportions of infectious clinical waste (ICW) and household wastes (HW), expressed in percentages. Ten measures were prospectively recorded for each type of procedure in a single teaching hospital from January to September 2022. The theoretical carbon footprint generated by the treatment of the wastes was estimated in kilograms of CO2 equivalent (KgEqCO2). The national extrapolation of the carbon footprint was performed by collecting the total number of procedures in France in 2021 using the VisuChir tool. Results A total of 937kg of waste were produced for the 140 procedures, amongst which 514kg of ICW (54.8%) and 423kg of HW (45.2%). The overall median waste weight was 5.9kg (Q1: 4.4, Q3: 8.1), ranging from 1.8kg to 18.3kg. The overall median waste weight for HW was 2.8kg (Q1: 2.5, Q3: 3.4), ranging from 1.8kg to 17.8kg. The overall median waste weight for ICW was 3.8kg (Q1: 2.7, Q3: 4.8), ranging from 0.8kg to 7.2kg. The knee surgeries were responsible for the heaviest waste weight; the least waste-productive procedures were the foot and the carpal tunnel release. The median proportions of ICW varied from 39% for the total knee replacements to 72% for the femoral nails. There was a significant inverse correlation between the total waste weight and the proportion of ICW: r=−0.47, p<10−4. The total median estimated carbon footprint was 4.3KgCO2Eq (Q1: 3.1, Q3: 5.8), ranging from 1.59KgCO2Eq (Q1: 1.5, Q3: 1.8) and 7.07KgCO2Eq (Q1: 6.7, Q3: 8.17). The total median estimated carbon footprint was 3.5KgCO2Eq for ICW (Q1: 2.5, Q3: 4.5) and 0.76KgCO2Eq (Q1: 0.54, Q3: 1.3) for HW. The national median estimated carbon footprint was 10.1 million KgEqCO2 in 2021 for orthopedic surgery. Conclusion Our study revealed that in most cases more than half of the wastes were ICW. The total estimated national carbon footprint for orthopedic procedures was 10 million kilograms. The reduction of the ICW constitutes a cornerstone, as they are responsible for more carbon emissions. Level of evidence III; prospective comparative observational in vivo study.",,,

Yet, they increase prices especially in the short term, and can affect households’ income depending on their carbon footprints. Cash transfer programs can be used to address adverse social impacts and protect the poorest. However, because carbon footprints, and the consequent tax impacts, may change over time it is important to understand how to design and adapt such cash transfer programs accordingly. As the existing studies focus on single years, we address the gap in the literature in two steps. First, we estimate changes in carbon footprints and their drivers over time; second, we simulate the effects of a carbon tax in combination with cash transfers on poverty and inequality for the years 2004, 2007 and 2011 in Peru. We combine a bottom-up household carbon footprint estimation, and multiple scenarios simulation. We show that, in a context of rapid economic growth, footprints increase over time, particularly for lower deciles. Most importantly, the distributional impacts of a reform combining carbon tax and cash transfers change by year. The paper concludes that, to maximize poverty and inequality reduction, the design of cash transfer programs and tax levels need to be adapted over time.",,,

This is mainly because the key pollutants in Pakistan's energy sector come from nonrenewable sources, such as coal and natural gas. However, the report observes that the carbon emissions within the nonrenewable energy sector are directly related to economic growth.

Since capturing the full lifecycle emissions of goods and services at the city level can be methodologically challenging due to the fact that cities have multiple sources of emissions (e.g. transportation, waste, buildings), our study focused on evaluating the carbon footprint of various types of urban buildings across six sectors. This evaluation was conducted in one of the most rapidly urbanized cities in the Middle East, Doha City, Qatar, and was based on electricity consumption data from 2017 to 2020. Using multiregional input–output life cycle assessment (MRIO-LCA) and hot/coldspot analysis, this study identified CF emission spatiotemporal patterns and the major buildings responsible for the highest emissions. The results indicated that residential villas and the commercial sector had the highest electricity consumption and steady increases in CF emissions during the study period, whereas hotels had the lowest annual electricity consumption among all sectors. The study also identified significant CF emission hotspots from Doha residential buildings in the southwestern and northeastern areas. In contrast, the CF hotspots from commercial buildings were concentrated in the industrial area in the southern part of the city and in the West Bay area in the eastern part. Overall, the findings of this study provide important policy implications and a comprehensive assessment of dynamic changes in CF emissions from different building types.",,,

Radiotherapy contributes to this with potential sources quantified here. Method Activity data for 42 patients from within the breast IMRT and prostate VMAT pathways were collected. Data for 20 prostate patients was also collected from 3 other centres to enable cross centre comparison. A process-based, bottom-up approach was used to calculate the carbon footprint. Additionally, patients were split into pre-COVID and COVID groups to assess the impact of protocol changes due to the pandemic. Results The calculated carbon footprint for prostate and breast pre-COVID were 148 kgCO2e and 101 kgCO2e respectively, and 226 kgCO2e and 75 kgCO2e respectively during COVID. The energy usage by the linac during treatment for a total course of radiotherapy for prostate treatments was 2–3 kWh and about 1 kWh for breast treatments. Patient travel made up the largest proportion (70–80%) of the calculated carbon footprint, with linac idle power second with ∼ 10% and PPE and SF6 leakage were both between 2 and 4%. Conclusion These initial findings highlight that the biggest contributor to the external beam radiotherapy carbon footprint was patient travel, which may motivate increased used of hypofractionation. Many assumptions and boundaries have been set on the data gathered, which limit the wider application of these results. However, they provide a useful foundation for future more comprehensive life cycle assessments.",,,

The main objective of this evaluation is to examine the effects of different degrees of decentralization in production networks of the chemical industry. Using the production of a biopolymer as an example, the study includes strategic supply chain planning by agent-based simulations, economic evaluation by calculation of net present values and environmental assessment by calculation of carbon footprints. By allowing for dynamic reconfiguration of the decentralized networks over time, it is shown that mobile, modular plant concepts are beneficial to reduce supply chain expenses. Transportation efforts resulting from strategic supply chain planning are reduced by 40 % with increasing degree of decentralization. The profitability of the decentralized networks is dominated by the costs for the production processes themselves as capital and operational expenditures allocate to >50 % of the total costs. Product prices of 3000 to 5500 €2020 per ton are necessary to reach profitability of the decentralized production networks. Regarding the environmental assessment, the carbon footprint of the supply chain accounts for <3 % of the total emissions, which are dominated by the provision of process heat that accounts for 46 to 68 % of the total emissions. Carbon footprint of the decentral production networks can be significantly reduced by a systematic electrification of 90 % of the process heat demand.",,475,

Consequently, there is a pressing need for more granular data at the subnational level to formulate effective and feasible measures in line with current decarbonization targets. In this study, we present the carbon footprint embodied in household consumption behavior of 11 major metropolitan areas in Japan. Furthermore, our study innovatively introduces a temporal perspective, employing time organization as an insightful indicator to delineate the disparities in carbon footprints that arise from varying carbon intensities of distinct activities. The results are given from the following three aspects: 1) structural comparison of urban household carbon footprints; 2) time-based activity differences and drivers; and 3) inequality analysis among different activity-based carbon footprints. Here, we found that eating contributes most substantially to the carbon footprint. Conversely, transportation activities manifest the greatest regional inequality in carbon footprints. These findings provide indispensable evidence for the development of city-specific net-zero-emission goals within Japan. Furthermore, they exemplify the value of incorporating a temporal dimension into household carbon footprint analyses, thereby providing a broader perspective for future investigations in this field.",,,

Many studies have been conducted worldwide to evaluate the CF of rapeseed and its byproducts; however, only a few of these studies have considered finer-scale spatial-temporal heterogeneity. Considering the advantages of using detailed crop information extracted by remote sensing (RS) techniques, we attempted to integrate RS into life cycle assessments to improve rapeseed CF evaluation. A case study was conducted from 2021 to 2023 in one of the most important grain- and rapeseed-producing areas in Southwest China, namely, the Chengdu Plain, covering an area of 18,810.00 km2. The results of our study suggest that: (1) the proposed approach is applicable for high-resolution (10 m ∗ 10 m) rapeseed distribution mapping; (2) the farm-based CFs of rapeseed in the studied region range from 3333.08 to 4572.82 kgCO2-eq ha−1, while the product-based CFs (PCFs) vary from 1316.23 to 2443.95 kgCO2-eq t−1.

Based on remote-sensing data of night light, net primary productivity, and land use, the present study utilized the light‑carbon conversion and carbon footprint measurement models to quantify the carbon footprint of energy consumption. An exploratory spatiotemporal data analysis method was implemented to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution path. Panel quantile regression and spatiotemporal transition-nested models were used to reveal the influence mechanism of the spatiotemporal evolution of the carbon footprint. The following results were obtained. (1) The carbon footprint of counties increased from 2001 to 2020. Counties with high‑carbon footprint diffused around the “one center and two axes”. Carbon-deficit counties exhibited a diffused trend towards the west. In 2020, 506 counties exhibited carbon deficits, and the carbon balance of the ecosystem was severely unbalanced. (2) The carbon footprint showed evident path dependence and Matthew effect. The high‑carbon footprint lock-in area comprising 177 counties is a challenging zone for governance. The 86 counties that exhibit carbon footprint changes are the key zones to drive the carbon footprint changes in the Basin. The change direction of the county's carbon footprint type, with evident spatial correlation characteristics, is in accordance with adjacent counties. (3) The carbon footprint spatiotemporal transition types and influence mechanisms in counties exhibited significant differences, with the coexistence of low-carbon footprint driving, low-carbon footprint restriction, high-carbon footprint driving and high-carbon footprint restriction modes. As the influence mechanisms of different modes and the paths to achieve “dual carbon” goals are different, the governance of different modes should focus on optimizing and strengthening restriction factors or controlling and improving of driving factors.",,,

The database encompasses information from 212 dairy cattle farms situated in the temperate-humid zone of northern Spain, spanning the period from 2014 to 2018. Farm classification was based on the presence (CcMz) or absence (ScCMz) of maize cultivation for silage production, resulting in 96 farms in the CcMz category and 116 farms in the ScCMz category.

Carbon footprint tracking apps (CFTAs) seek to address this information gap by continuously educating consumers on their carbon emissions. Since the effectiveness of CFTAs has not yet been investigated at all, the authors developed a CFTA to explore whether and how such applications help shape consumption behavior. Over several survey rounds, 216 participants used the application to log their consumption in four main consumption domains. The results indicate that the feedback given can help decrease carbon emissions by 23%. The impact varies by consumption category, ranging from a 12% reduction in mobility to a 35% reduction in household activities. Moreover, individual traits influence the effectiveness of CFTA usage: Perceived green self-efficacy amplifies the feedback's effect, whereas a strong green self-identity diminishes it. Based on these results, the authors guide practitioners and academics on how to employ CFTAs to foster and research sustainable consumer behavior, and the authors show how to account for inter-individual differences when endorsing such apps. Future research should probe ways to boost effectiveness in specific areas and for particular personalities.",,,

Energy storage capacity buildup at all levels of the global energy system is expected to accelerate the decarbonization process. To this end, a coherent mathematical framework to ascertain the carbon footprint of localized energy systems with energy storage is indispensable. This article presents an open-source energy system simulation program — Energy System Network (ESN). A variety of energy system configurations can be simulated with the Python program, which incorporates key energy system components such as generation, grid, storage, and loads. ESN features an integrated bottom-up approach that combines energy system modeling with streamlined life cycle assessment techniques to quantify the carbon footprint of all components in a localized energy system. The lifecycle phases of each component, including production, operation, and end-of-life treatment, can be considered. Carbon footprint values are obtained for two demonstrative case studies with lithium-ion battery applications: energy arbitrage and home energy systems. The metric Levelized Emissions of Energy Supply (LEES) has been used to evaluate the carbon footprint of each application. An unconventional energy arbitrage strategy designed to exploit the grid carbon intensity spreads instead of the energy price spreads manages to achieve a LEES value about 17% lower than the conventional variant. The influence of rooftop solar generation, battery energy storage system, and the energy management strategy on the LEES values for a home energy system is explored. A maximum LEES reduction of over 37% vis-á-vis the base scenario was observed with optimal energy management for the solar generation and the battery system. The open-source availability of ESN can contribute to transparency, comparability, and reproducibility in carbon footprint assessments of localized energy systems with energy storage.",,,

Additionally, the carbon footprint fluctuates with processing states and equipment systems owing to the discontinuous process in LDMD involving the layer-by-layer deposition and the laser-powder coupling. This paper investigated dynamic carbon footprint based on the resource and energy consumption from the process-oriented standpoint in LDMD process, which quantified the processing time, power distribution and material consumption of each processing state for every sub-system. In this research, the discontinuous process was divided into effective processing state, rapid moving state and transformed delay state and the processing time of each state were estimated with process parameters. Besides, the operating state time and power distribution of five sub-systems were estimated combining the equipment triggering mechanism and the processing state time.

Through these options, the goal is to reconfigure on-grid wind energy/desalination systems for large- and medium-scale water production. In this context, it is proposed to use lithium-ion batteries for stationary energy storage together with management strategies aimed at avoiding the wind energy/desalination systems having to consume energy from the conventional grid they are connected to. The control strategy is based on ensuring that the power provided by the wind farm and batteries remains in synchrony with the power demand of the desalination plant throughout the system's useful life. The interannual variation of wind energy is considered when sizing the renewable energy system and processes for its estimation are proposed. The case study is centred on the Canary Archipelago, a region that is especially vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, but which enjoys exceptional characteristics for the exploitation of wind energy. The results obtained show the optimal wind farm and energy storage system capacities of the analysed configurations. The approach presented allows a low-carbon operational footprint. If the control strategy were to be put into practice today, the current grid restrictions and a life cycle assessment of the system carried out in a societal context that continues to be fossil fuel dependent indicate a potential reduction of 77.4% of the footprint. However, the remaining 22.6% could be eliminated in the future when the manufacturing processes of wind turbines, batteries and desalination plants receive the benefits of carbon-neutral societies.",,,

In this procedure, the management of polygeneration systems is discussed from various aspects, including climatic change, techno-economic and environmental conditions, layout design, ecological sustainability, and the sociological approach to polygeneration systems in a practical form. As a case study, an innovative biomass-solar-wind polygeneration system to produce power, ammonia, and freshwater for Ahvaz in Iran was designed and evaluated according to the developed procedure. The integration of multi-effect distillation and humidification-dehumidification desalination has been employed for freshwater production. For ammonia production, syngas produced in the gasification unit and nitrogen obtained from the air separation unit were utilized. Power production has been achieved using a combination of the hydrogen-ammonia Brayton cycle, the supercritical carbon dioxide cycle, and the organic Rankine cycle. The designed system was evaluated using energy, exergy, exergoeconomic, exergoenvironmental, emergoeconomic, emergoenvironmental, carbon footprint, and water footprint analyses. The layout design of the proposed system and the sociological study of the system from a systemic approach have enhanced the visibility of its application. Additionally, the investigation of biomass fuel variations and combinations according to climate, along with optimization and dynamic analyses, are key measures that allow for a more comprehensive evaluation of the system from various management perspectives. The results show that the proposed system is capable of producing 523.34 m3/day freshwater, 10.1 MW of power, and storing 17.75 ton/day of ammonia in optimal state.

However, the impact of the health sector’s emissions on human health is not regularly assessed. We aim to estimate the health burden and associated costs of the health sector’s carbon footprint within the European Union (EU). Methods We calculated disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and associated costs based on human health damage factors (DALYs/kg-CO2e) by considering four scenarios. Three scenarios for shared socioeconomic pathways (S1 – high growth, S2 − baseline, and S3 − low growth) represented variations of global society, demographics, and economics until 2100. A fourth scenario (S4) considered the current EU’s 55% reduction goal of greenhouse gas emissions. The healthcare sector’s emissions per capita (in CO2-equivalent) in 2019 were extracted from the Lancet Countdown, and population data were retrieved from Eurostat for the same year. Results In the EU, 365,047 DALYs (95%CI: 194,692–535,403) are expected to be caused by the health sector’s emissions at baseline (S2). In an S1 scenario, the burden would slightly decrease to 316,374 DALYs (95%CI: 170,355–462,393), whereas a S3 scenario would increase 486,730 DALYs (95%CI: 243,365–681,422). If EU’s carbon goals are met, the burden could be substantially reduced to 164,271 DALYs (95%CI: 87,611–240,931). Costs can amount to 25.6 billion euros, when considering DALYs monetisation. Conclusion CO2 emissions from the health sector are expected to significantly impact human health. Therefore, it is important to ensure that EU climate policies for public buildings are in line with the Paris Agreement, increase funding for climate mitigation programs within the healthcare sector, and review clinical practices at the local level.",,,

Within surgery, reducing the number of instruments that are sterilized and disposable supplies that are used for each operation may help achieve both goals. We wanted to measure the existing variability in surgical instrument and supply choices and assess whether standardization could have a meaningful cost and environmental impact. Methods We analyzed surgeon preference cards for common general surgery operations at our hospital to measure the number of sterilizable instrument trays and supplies used by each surgeon for each operation. From this data, we calculated supply costs, carbon footprint, and median operative time and studied the variability in each of these metrics. Results Among the ten operations studied, variability in sterilizable instrument trays requested on surgeon preference cards ranged from one to eight. Variability in disposable supplies requested ranged from 17 to 45. Variability in open supply costs ranged from $104 to $4184. Variability in carbon footprint ranged from 17 to 708 kg CO2e. If the highest-cost surgeon for each operation switched their preference card to that of the median-cost surgeon, $245,343 in open supply costs and 41,708 kg CO2e could be saved. Conclusions There is significant variability in the instrument and supply choices of surgeons performing common general surgery operations. Standardizing this variability may lead to meaningful cost savings and carbon footprint reduction, especially if scaled across the entire health system.",,739,

This study analyzed several sewage indicators, revealing that the majority exceed the national standards of China for direct water discharge. A field experiment was conducted over a period of 4 months to evaluate the effects of different treatments during the natural decomposition of bamboo shoot shells.The treatment groups consisted of the boiled experimental group (EG) and the control group (CG). Results showed that in EG, the methane emission increased by 8.6% (P < 0.05), the carbon dioxide emission increased significantly by 19.7% (P < 0.01), and the nitrous oxide emission decreased by 37.9% (P < 0.01) relative to those in CG. Regression analysis was employed to establish a relationship model between CH4, CO2, and N2O emission fluxes and temperature and humidity in the EG and CG groups. A specific functional relationship was identified between CH4 and CO2 emission fluxes and temperature and humidity, but N2O emission was present. No significant correlation was found between flux and ambient temperature and humidity (R2 < 0.3). We also estimated that the carbon dioxide emissions and water consumption of producing 1 kg of canned bamboo shoots were 2.8669 kg and 86.8 L, covering the processes in the life cycle of bamboo shoot products. This study identifies the potential water pollution problems and provides insights into resource utilization and recycling in bamboo shoot food processing, facilitating the realization of clean production processes. It also sheds light on the water footprint of bamboo shoot products throughout their life cycle, and the carbon footprint research provides valuable references.",,,

Nordic countries are showing high engagement to climate change mitigation while the consumption and lifestyle-based carbon footprints are among the global highest. Majority of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are connected to household consumption where various behavioral changes have been presented in order to reduce the personal carbon footprints. Previous research has shown how behaviors are connected to the living environment and urban structure, which have shown having an impact in forming variations in our lifestyles and behavioral patterns. In this study, with a survey dataset of ∼8000 respondents across the five Nordic countries, the engagement of respondents to different climate and carbon mitigation actions were analyzed and linked to their calculated carbon footprints. Three types of behavioral clusters were found among the respondents, one presenting conscious pro-climate behavior, one relating to frugality behavior, and one cluster related to self-sufficient behavior. The pro-climate behavioral intentions were present more in urbanized areas together with high climate motivation, whereas frugality behavior was level across the urban gradient, and finally respondents from less urbanized areas emphasized self-sufficient behavior. The stated behavioral intentions of the respondents were in contrast to their carbon footprints. Carbon footprints related to leisure consumption were highest in the urban regions and everyday consumption related footprints in the rural regions. Interestingly, only frugality behavior was associated with lower carbon footprints both in everyday and leisure consumption categories, whereas climate conscious behavior was positively related to leisure consumption footprint but negatively related to everyday consumption. The findings emphasize the variation of lifestyles based on different actions in different urban forms where the engagement to climate change mitigation presents differently. The results underline the importance of understanding the role that the built environment plays in being linked to the behavioral patterns and the need to increase the knowledge of the climate impacts of behavioral choices.",,,

Their swift economic expansion and associated activities lead to a rise in carbon footprint. Keeping this in view, unlike previous studies, this study unfolds the asymmetric repercussions of competitive industrial performance and renewable energy within the context of the industrialization era in seven Asian developing countries from 1990 to 2020. The panel NARDL and asymmetric panel causality methodologies have been applied for the purpose of nonlinear analysis. According to the results, the advantageous influence of competitive industrial performance is considerably more pronounced than that of industrialization. The coefficient magnitude associated with the negative shock demonstrates a significantly substantial value in comparison to the positive shock concerning the influence of competitive industrial performance on carbon footprint. Both positive and negative changes in competitive industrial performance mitigate carbon footprint. Renewable energy generates favorable consequences by promoting environmental quality via a reduction in carbon footprint. Across various emerging economies in Asia, the rapid rise of industrialization is linked to the deterioration of environmental quality. Finally, artificial intelligence and natural resource rents decrease carbon footprints while information and communication technology intensifies environmental concerns. The research emphasizes the critical nature of integrating artificial intelligence, robotics, and technological industrial competitiveness in order to adequately tackle the carbon footprint in Asian developing countries.",,,

However, provincial carbon footprints of solar panels based on different production and waste treatment techniques have not been estimated before, including the accumulated and potentially reduced amount of carbon footprints (compared with designed optimal scenarios) in China. This research aims to calculate the total and reduced carbon footprints of solar panels by using the provincial electricity generation data of PVs in China. Results show that the national accumulated carbon emissions of installed panels from 2011 to 2035 would exceed 5 Gt CO2eq by 2060. With advanced production technology and efficient waste treatment, the emissions could be significantly reduced by 50% for the whole lifecycle and 36% for recycling. Although large emission variations existed among provinces, the dominant emission sources shifted from the northwest to eastern regions of China in recent years. Our study provides fundamental guidance to the governmental regulations of waste PVs as well as technological development of recycling treatment scenarios.",,,

We employ a demographically representative online survey among the adult population in Germany which includes a carbon footprint calculator and the randomized information nudges. Results from estimating double-hurdle regression models suggest that the size nudge increases participants' average WTPO by about one third.

We further find that participants' response to the information nudge is primarily effective for younger participants, females, participants with mid-range income, with high levels of education, and with low to medium-sized carbon footprints, ceteris paribus. Further, the WTPO is positively related with income, education, carbon literacy, and environmental preferences. Also, participants tend to underestimate the size of their carbon footprint relative to that of others.

This article connects conspicuous/luxury (C/L) consumption in India to its local, regional and global environmental impacts. We evaluate carbon dioxide (CO2), water, and particulate matter (PM2.5) footprints of consumption disaggregated into food-basic, nonfood-basic, and C/L consumption across expenditure deciles. We find that all three footprints rise, but at different rates, with increasing expenditure. Notably, CO2 and PM2.5 intensities of C/L consumption increase with income, unlike all other intensities of consumption. However, in all three footprints, there is a disproportionate rise in the top decile, which is driven by C/L consumption expenditure more than the pollution intensity of C/L consumption. These results imply that demand reduction measures in C/L consumption could have broad-based and deep environmental benefits, while pollutant-specific mitigation policies may face trade-offs with other environmental impacts. There is a need for further research on connecting local and regional environmental footprints with the actual impacts, to better understand the relationships between conspicuous/luxury consumption and multi-dimensional environmental impacts in developing countries context.",,,

The rice-wheat rotation is one of the main food crop systems in China. However, no comprehensive assessment of the water footprint (WF), carbon footprint (CF), carbon production efficiency (CPE), and net ecosystem economic benefits (NEEB) of different rice-wheat rotation systems has been reported. Objective This study was conducted to assess the productivity, WF, CF, CPE, and NEEB of dry direct-seeded, wet direct-seeded, and transplanted rice-wheat (TR-W) rotation systems. The objective was to provide theoretical guidance for the development of clean and sustainable rice-wheat rotation production technology systems. Methods We used a split-plot design, with the main plots being the dry direct-seeded, wet direct-seeded, and transplanted rice planting methods, and the subplots consisting of two rice genotypes. Dry direct-seeded rice was mainly rainfed, ensuring that the soil remained relatively dry so that the soil is kept aerobic during the whole reproductive period of rice. Wet direct-seeded rice continues to keep the soil moist after sowing; the plots were maintained under a water layer of 3–10 cm following the emergence of 4.5 leaves, a condition that persisted until two weeks prior to the rice harvest. Transplanted rice was maintained under a water layer of 3–10 cm following transplanting until 2 weeks prior to the rice harvest. Subsequent to the rice harvest, the above-ground rice stubble was removed, and the ground was tilled with a rotary tiller in preparation for the subsequent wheat planting. Results Results demonstrated that the annual yield from the dry direct-seeded rice-wheat (DR-W) rotation system was comparable to the wet direct-seeded rice-wheat (WR-W) rotation system, while significantly lower than that of the TR-W rotation system. However, the WF of DR-W rotation system was 45.96% and 33.94% lower than that of WR-W and TR-W rotation systems, respectively, and the CF was 35.57% and 25.87% lower than that of WR-W and TR-W rotation systems, respectively. Therefore, its water and carbon production efficiencies were higher than those of WR-W and TR-W rotation systems. In addition, NEEB in DR-W and TR-W was comparable and significantly higher than that in WR-W. Conclusions The DR-W rotation was a promising rotation system according to the comparable annual yield, lower water and carbon footprints, higher CPE, and comparable or higher NEEB in comparison with other rice-wheat rotation systems. Significance We suggest that the DR-W rotation should be promoted as the primary production mode for the rice-wheat rotation.",,,

This paper presents a carbon footprint assessment, implemented actions for GHG emission reduction, and offers the example of a professional Finnish ice hockey team that achieved carbon neutrality. The study is based on a life cycle assessment method. The Results show that the team's carbon footprint was reduced from 350 tCO2eq by more than 50% between seasons 2018–2019 and 2021–2022 in the assessed categories. The most GHG emission reductions were achieved in the team's and spectators' mobility and ice hall energy consumption. Furthermore, the team compensated for their remaining emissions to achieve carbon neutrality. Multiple possibilities for further GHG emission reductions were recognized. The majority of the GHG emissions were linked to the Scope 3 category, indicating that co-operation with partners and stakeholders was a key to success in attaining carbon neutrality. This paper also discusses the possible limitations and challenges that sport organizations face in assessing climate impacts and reducing GHG emissions, as well as the prospects of overcoming them. Since there are many opportunities for sports to contribute to climate change mitigation, relevant targets and actions to reduce GHG emissions should be integrated into all sport organizations' management.",,,

The present systematic review aimed to review the current literature assessing the carbon footprint of surgical procedures in different surgical fields. Following to the PRISMA statement checklist, three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library) were searched by independent reviewers, who screened records on title and abstract first, and then on the full text. Risk of bias was evaluated using the MINORS system. Over the 878 articles initially identified, 36 original studies were included. They considered ophthalmologic surgical procedures (30.5%), general/digestive surgery (19.4%), gynecologic procedures (13.9%), orthopedic procedures (8.3%), neurosurgery (5.5%), otolaryngology/head and neck surgery (5.5%), plastic/dermatological surgery (5.5%), and cardiac surgery (2.8%). Despite a great methodological heterogeneity, data showed that a single surgical procedure emits 4–814 kgCO2e, with anesthetic gases and energy consumption representing the largest sources of greenhouse gas emission. Minimally invasive surgical techniques may require more resources than conventional open surgery, particularly for packaging and plastics, energy use, and waste production. Each OR has the potential to produce from 0.2 to 4kg of waste per case with substantial differences depending on the type of intervention, hospital setting, and geographic area. Overall, the selected studies were found to be of moderate quality. Based on a qualitative synthesis of the available literature, the OR can be targeted by programs and protocols implemented to reduce the carbon footprint and improve the waste stream of the OR.","2, Supplement",14,Écoresponsabilité en chirurgie

From a global warming perspective, in 2018, Iran was the seventh-highest greenhouse gas emitter in the world. An implementation should demonstrate that it is possible to estimate the environmental impact of climate change. A simple carbon footprint estimation model for waste-to-energy power plants with a life cycle assessment using the 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines is presented in this study. For this purpose, first the system boundary is determined. Then, the total emissions of each part within boundary are identified in terms of total greenhouse gas emission (and expressed in mass of carbon dioxide equivalent). In conclusion, the carbon footprint of generating one kWh of electricity is estimated. The final emission of the Tehran power plant is calculated at 24.46 ktCO2eq/year. Thus, the carbon footprint is estimated to be 1351.94 g CO2eq/kWh. Key parameters that affect carbon footprint are divided into two groups: emission parameters and electricity generation parameters. The sensitivity analysis of effective parameters showed the distance travelled and weight of waste transported during waste transportation, the fossil carbon content in waste composition has the highest effect on carbon footprint. The study shows a 1.2-fold difference between the carbon footprint of two current scenarios of waste treatment: landfill and waste-to-energy plant. The life cycle emissions of landfills exceed of waste-to-energy plants, indicating that these systems can contribute significantly to addressing the current environmental challenges. Additionally, they offer advantages in terms of electricity generation.",,2632,

For this purpose, we use the environmentally extended multiregional input-output model and the Spanish Households Budget Survey to extract expenditure microdata by municipality size. We find that households in smaller municipalities have a larger total carbon footprint due to their higher direct emissions. Although their consumption is lower than other municipalities, they have a more intensive pattern of embedded carbon consumption. Households in smaller municipalities spend a higher share in private transport and housing-related activities, emitting almost an additional ton of direct carbon emissions. Regarding their mitigation potential, results show that for every euro that municipalities with less than 10,000 inhabitants reduce their consumption, they would reduce emissions by 0.796 kgCO2. However, while the size of the municipality increases, the mitigation potential decreases (0.378 kgCO2 for more than 100,000 inhabitants). This highest mitigation potential will only be achieved if mitigation policies especially favor their inhabitants and if infrastructures and social services are developed to facilitate a change in their consumption patterns.",,,

The studies on the carbon footprints of different types of wooden doors are few. In this study, the cradle-to-grave carbon footprints of three types of wooden doors produced in China were comparatively analyzed. Models used for calculating the total life-cycle carbon footprint of a wood-based composite door, a solid wood composite door, and a solid wood door were developed. Considering the biogenic carbon storage and its delayed emissions, the wood-based composite door, solid wood composite door, and solid wood door featured carbon footprints of 0.379, 0.257, and −0.277 kg CO2 e per kg product, respectively. The solid wood door exhibited a negative carbon footprint, indicating that its carbon storage was higher than the carbon emission during the life cycle stage. The raw material acquisition (38%–66%) and the transportation stages (23%–38%) of the three types of wooden doors were the main contributors to the total carbon footprints (excluding the biogenic carbon). The product manufacturing stage released relatively small emissions (11%–24%). The waste disposal treatment at the end-of-life phase, the degradation of wood materials in landfills, and their service life displayed significant impacts on the carbon footprints of the three types of wooden doors. Fiberboard, laminated veneer lumber, sawn lumber, finger-jointed lumber, and electricity were identified as the main emission hotspots. This study provides guidelines for low-carbon development in the wooden door industry.",,,

This study assessed LULCC and its associated carbon footprints in different natural ecosystems. It also established forest reference levels (FRL). We used Landsat images for supervised classification and conducted forest inventories in 186 plots that span moist semi-deciduous forest, swamp forest, gallery forest, woodland and savannah areas. Biomass calculations employed allometric models, biomass expansion factors, and root-to-shoot ratios. Except in Lama Forest Reserve, anthropogenic pressures led to the regressive conversion of natural forest areas to savannah, croplands, and fallows. A progressive trend was observed in semi-deciduous forest (3.18 % per year), resulting in a positive LULC carbon footprint (16.06 tCO2eq.yr−1ha−1). 41.94 % of typical swamp forest was lost, releasing -62.89 tCO2eq.yr−1ha−1. Similarly, woodland decreased by -1.48 and -5.89 % per year, according to considered site, with emissions of -12.16 and -21.83 tCO2eq.yr−1ha−1, respectively.

It has been well understood that economic growth has a significant impact on carbon footprint, but it remains unclear whether this impact will be mitigated or intensified by reducing income inequality. By applying the Multi-Regional Input-Output model, this study assesses the consumption-based carbon footprints of 43 major economies over the period 1995–2019 and conducts the corresponding empirical analysis. Through examining the moderating effect of income inequality (Gini coefficient) on the relationship between economic growth (GDP per capita) and consumption-based carbon footprint (CO2 per capita), we demonstrate that a lower Gini coefficient – a more equitable distribution of income − could significantly promote the decoupling of economic growth from carbon footprint. The results also show a heterogeneous moderating effect of income inequality – reducing income inequality in rich countries helps decouple economic growth from carbon footprint more than in poor countries. This study contributes to a better understanding of the synergy among economic growth (SDG 8), income inequality reduction (SDG 10), and carbon mitigation (SDG 13). Given that reducing income inequality in the context of economic growth can have significant benefits for carbon mitigation, we would suggest that income inequality reduction should be incorporated into climate action, particularly in rich countries.",,,

However, the flooding of lands following the construction of the dam generally leads to an increase in biogenic GHG emissions due to the degradation of biomass found in the newly created reservoir. The life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology is widely used to calculate and compare the carbon footprint of different electricity production pathways, while considering all life cycle stages. Net biogenic GHG emissions from hydropower reservoirs have been poorly considered in LCA because of the scarcity of data. These emissions are complex to quantify as several mechanisms are involved, and extrapolating observations from one reservoir to another is risky as emissions vary greatly depending on different parameters, such as climate, geographic location, age of impoundment, and watershed properties. The objective of this article is to compare different approaches to estimate hydropower reservoir emissions in LCA, to select the most appropriate one, and to apply it to the calculation of the carbon footprint of electricity distributed in the Canadian province of Québec. Net biogenic GHG emissions of all hydropower reservoirs in the province (with 2.5 and 97.5% confidence intervals), as estimated using the G-res model, are 16.5 (14.7–18.6) gCO2∙kWh−1 and 0.29 (0.23–0.35) gCH4∙kWh−1.

The results show that (i) There is a negative relationship between renewable energy consumption and per capita ecological footprint and per capita carbon emissions, indicating that renewable energy consumption alleviates environmental pressure. (ii) When renewable energy consumption increases, the negative effects of renewable energy on per capita ecological footprint and per capita carbon emissions become more significant. This means that the more renewable energy is developed, the more it helps to alleviate environmental pressure.

However, micro carbon element flow analysis is rarely focused considering treatment efficiency of different technology. In this research, a comprehensive carbon footprint analysis is established under the micro carbon element flow analysis and macro carbon footprint analysis based on life cycle assessment (LCA). Three wastewater treatment processes (i.e., anaerobic anoxic oxic, A2O; cyclic activated sludge technology, CAST; modified cyclic activated sludge technology, M-CAST) for low carbon source urban wastewater are selected. The micro key element flow analysis illustrated that carbon source mainly flows to the assimilation function to promote microorganism growth. The carbon footprint analysis illustrated that M-CAST as the optimal wastewater treatment process had the lowest global warming potential (GWP). The key to reduce carbon emissions is to limit electricity consumption in wastewater treatment processes. Under the comprehensive carbon footprint analysis, M-CAST has the lowest environmental impact with low carbon emissions. The sensitivity analysis results revealed that biotreatment section variables considerably reduced the environmental impact on the LCA and the GWP, followed by the sludge disposal section.

Considering annual data from 2000 to 2020, advanced panel data estimation techniques that are robust against data-related problems such as endogeneity, heterogeneous slope coefficients, and dependency among the cross-sectional units are utilized. Overall, the results certify that making productive use of energy reduces consumption-based carbon footprints in E7 countries but not in G7 countries. Besides, improving institutional quality is seen to not only reduce carbon footprints in both samples directly but also indirectly mediate and moderate the energy productivity-carbon footprint nexus in G7 and E7 countries, respectively. Moreover, financial globalization is observed to minimize carbon footprints in G7 countries while boosting them in E7 countries. Contrastingly, financial development is observed to homogeneously boost the carbon footprint levels of both G7 and E7 countries. Lastly, international trade is found not to influence the carbon footprint levels in both samples of countries.

Quantifying the carbon footprint of all the major food categories in different continents is critical for accurately evaluating various aspects of GHG emissions from food production on a continental and global scale. Such information, however, is lacking. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis of plant-based and animal-based food production in all continents comprehensively using 5353 carbon footprint values from 524 published papers and calculated GHG emissions from food production (system boundary is from cradle to farm gate) at the continental and global scale. Our results indicate that the average carbon footprint of plant-based foods amounts to 0.66 kg CO2-eq kg−1, which is only 10.7% of animal-based foods (6.15 kg CO2-eq kg−1). The carbon footprint of plant-based food in Asia and Europe is 8.9%–184% higher than that of other continents. Africa has the lowest carbon footprint for plant-based foods, owing to its low agricultural input and limited crop management. However, the carbon footprint of animal-based foods in Africa and Asia is 2.5%–150% higher than that of other continents, with North America and Oceania recording the lowest. Total annual GHG emission from global food production reached 8125 Mt CO2-eq, with grains, meat, and milk together accounting for 70.8%. Asia, owing to its large production, emerged as the largest emitter, accounting for 55.4% of global GHG emissions. It was followed by Europe (16.3%) and North America (10.5%), while Africa, South America and Oceania together emit 17.8%.

Bananas are of great economic importance in tropical regions, and their production is characterized by high consumption of natural resources, increasing greenhouse gas emissions and environmental impacts. This study aimed to identify critical points in banana production, understand how they influence future footprints, and develop strategies to reduce current footprints. Life cycle assessment was used to estimate water scarcity (ISO 14046) and carbon (ISO 14067) footprints. Results are presented per 1 kg of banana. Primary data from 10-year averages were collected from farms located in the Lower Jaguaribe sub-basin. The results revealed that the carbon footprint ranged from 0.21 to 0.84 kg CO2 eq kg−1 in 2023, whereas the water scarcity footprint reached 1441 m3 eq kg−1. Under the current scenario, yield improvement could reduce carbon footprint by up to 57.9%, and greater efficiency in water use could decrease water footprint by up to 77%. In 2055, projections suggest that improvements in irrigation could lead to reductions of 5% in carbon footprint and 24.9% in water scarcity footprint. The findings of this study highlight the importance of adopting a sustainable approach to banana production, emphasizing the need to improve natural resource management and promote conscious agricultural practices, such as no-till farming and polyculture, which favor carbon sequestration. The use of plants that perform biological nitrogen fixation can reduce the need for nitrogen fertilizers, in alignment with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

Attention should therefore be paid to the entire life-cycle energy and carbon footprints of LLM-powered intelligent chatbots in both the present and future in order to mitigate their climate change impact. In this work, we clarify and highlight the energy consumption and carbon emission implications of eight main phases throughout the life cycle of the development of such intelligent chatbots. Based on a life-cycle and interaction analysis of these phases, we propose a system-level solution with three strategic pathways to optimize the management of this industry and mitigate the related footprints. While anticipating the enormous potential of this advanced technology and its products, we make an appeal for a rethinking of the mitigation pathways and strategies of the life-cycle energy usage and carbon emissions of the LLM-powered intelligent chatbot industry and a reshaping of their energy and environmental implications at this early stage of development.",,,

However, research integrating life cycle and energy analysis is missing to inform decision-makers. Method Consequently, the paper presents models combining a model-based life cycle assessment (MBLCA) and ship energy simulations to examine the footprints of a generic New Panamax Containership (DTC). Analyses were conducted to assess the energy and carbon effects of using synthetic methanol as marine fuel. Results The life-cycle analysis confirms the overwhelming prevalence of operations in the total greenhouse gases emission during the ship's lifetime. The analysis highlights the potential of carbon savings if the vessel consumes methanol produced from neutral energy and renewable carbon sources. However, the magnitude of shipping fuel requirements may profoundly impact energy infrastructures while still requiring large volumes of carbon offset credits. Conclusion The paper confirms the usefulness of integrating life-cycle analysis and energy modelling to discuss future energy scenarios. The completeness of the models also allows for future research analysing other energy solutions.",,,

However, the features, changing trends, and determinants of the carbon footprint flow embodied in global population migration are poorly understood. This study employed social network analysis and the exponential random graph model (ERGM) to investigate the structural changes and drivers of the carbon footprint network embodied in global migration from 1995 to 2015. The results showed that approximately 50% of carbon footprint flow embodied in international migration flowed from developing to developed countries. The spatial connections between countries in the network were becoming increasingly close, displaying a typical small-world structure, and showing low reciprocity and negative assortativity. Moreover, centrality analysis highlighted the United States and the European Union as being at the core of the network, whereas some emerging economies (e.g., China, India, and South Africa) were shown as having an increasing influence on the network. The determinants of network formation were divided into three effects. For node attribute effect, countries with developed economy, high proportion of industrial value added, urbanization and openness were becoming the destinations of carbon inflows from immigrants, while countries with high consumption of renewable energy and energy intensity had a trend of carbon outflows with emigrants over periods. As for exogenous network effect, the significance of economic integration on the formation of the network was strengthening, while that of geographical proximity and cultural similarity was declining. Additionally, the positive impact of self-organizational effect on the network was decreasing. This study provided guidance for countries to formulate policies to reduce the carbon emissions embodied in international migration.",,,

However, the lifecycle carbon intensity of electrochemical batteries is uncertain throughout lifecycle battery-related activities. In this study, a generic methodology is proposed to accurately quantify the lifecycle carbon intensity of electrochemical batteries. A cross-scale multi-stage analytic platform with inter-disciplinary and trans-disciplinary is formulated, involving battery materials (anode, cathode, electrolyte), charging/discharging behaviours, cascade battery utilization, recycling, and reproduction. A case study on a zero-energy district in subtropical Guangzhou indicates that lifetime EV battery carbon intensity is +556 kg CO2,eq/kWh for the scenario with pure fossil fuel-based grid reliance, while the minimum carbon intensity of EVs at −860 kg CO2,eq/kWh can be achieved for the solar-wind supported scenario. The grid mandatory EVs charging will slightly increase the battery carbon intensity to −617.2 kg CO2,eq/kWh, and the exclusion of embodied carbon on both solar PV and wind turbines will increase the battery carbon intensity to −583.8 kg CO2,eq/kWh.

However, RALBP considering carbon footprint, which is a very significant environmental concern, has scarcely been studied in the literature and a practical “cross-station” design is never mathematically formulated. In this paper, a mixed-integer programming model is proposed to optimize the two objectives according to the Pareto principle. A particle swarm algorithm (PSO) with some improvement rules is designed to solve the problem. To examine the efficiency of the algorithm, computational experiments including five medium-sized and five large-sized datasets are conducted. The results show that the efficiency of PSO is better than that of four other classic algorithms in terms of three evaluation metrics.

Indeed, the country has realized that it is time to monitor its environmental indicators such as energy consumption, accounting, and carbon footprint to comply with global efforts to reduce carbon footprint and aim for energy efficiency while preserving and optimizing its energy resources. Much attention has been focused on the transportation sector, the second-largest global polluter, which will be the subject of our analysis. Our case study will focus on the evaluation of three vehicles to examine the influence of driver behavior on energy consumption and carbon footprint. Data collection was carried out using UPLOGISTIX, a solution developed by our hosting entity, which aims to present calculations of environmental measures to display the results and ultimately provide recommendations for reducing its carbon footprint. An approach has been proposed to achieve the set objectives. The results of our analysis highlight the existence of a significant relationship between behavioral barriers and energy consumption. Indeed, the behavior of a reckless driver, characterized by abrupt braking, rapid accelerations, and other factors, leads to an actual energy consumption that exceeds recommended standards.

To address this, efficient energy utilization in existing industries is crucial. Energy audits identify energy losses and recommend saving measures. Therefore, this study evaluates energy efficiency through an audit and estimates greenhouse gas emissions for a Meta Abo brewery. The indirect method of energy audit and the greenhouse gas protocol of carbon footprint estimation were used to evaluate the energy efficiency and carbon emissions of Meta Abo brewery. The boiler efficiency for Bono Energia and Cochran boilers was found to be 79.2% and 80.9%, respectively. Poor insulation caused an estimated annual fuel loss of 35,350 l (638,768 Ethiopian birr) for steam pipes, while steam leakage resulted in a loss of 31,614 l (571,265 Ethiopian birr). The factory's high electricity expense was attributed to a diesel generator consuming 6000 l/d. Greenhouse gas emissions raised from 9156 to 22,697 tons of CO2 equivalent between 2014 and 2018. Implementing the proposed energy-saving measures could save 20.4 TJ of thermal and electrical energy annually, costing approximately 8.5 million Ethiopian birr, and reduce boiler emissions by 455 tons of CO2 equivalent.

With the rapidly increasing demand for food and high carbon mitigation pressure, food consumption in rural China has emerged as a pivotal factor in the transition process. Although diet-related carbon footprint (DCF) has been widely discussed worldwide, little is known about intra-group differences in DCFs, particularly in rural regions. Additionally, a sustainable transition pathway is unclear because of the trade-offs between DCF, nutritional quality, and affordability. In this study, inequality in intra-rural food consumption and the associated carbon footprints of different food categories were revealed based on the latest and most updated social household survey data. Future transition pathways encompassing DCFs, affordability, and nutrition were comprehensively considered. The results revealed stark intragroup differences in the DCF of rural residents, and the consumption of animal-based food exhibited a more pronounced level of inequality than plant-based food. Compared with other groups, high-income households had a higher per capita DCF, larger emission share from animal-based food, and lower share from plant-based food. Based on future sustainable transition analysis, fully adopting optimized dietary patterns can reduce the DCF by 2.28–48.84% and improve nutritional quality, especially in low-income populations (16.98–38.62%). However, regardless of the transition pathway, affordability for low-income groups needs to be considered, which may hinder sustainable transitions in the future.

However, this industry is frequently linked to environmental issues, particularly its potential emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs). This study attempts to estimate the carbon footprint of a palm oil company's operation for the year of 2030. In doing so, a novel methodology that consists of organizational lifecycle assessment (O-LCA), simple linear regression (SLR), and double exponential smoothing (DES) methods is proposed. O-LCA is used to identify the sources of emission and estimate the amount of the emission generated, while SLR and DES are used to forecast the sources. As the result, the carbon footprint in 2030 is estimated to be 62,758,433.56 kg Carbon Dioxide equivalent (CO2eq) where on average a ton of crude palm oil (CPO) produces 1.08 ton CO2eq. The study also discloses that the three largest emission sources are palm oil mill effluent (POME), fertilizer, and transportation. The forecasting methods used are quite accurate with mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of less than 10%. The results of this study can shed a light to help Indonesia achieving its target to reduce GHG emission by 2030.",,,

In the EC system, there is a varying flux footprint climatology which causes a spatial mismatch between the forcing data from the ET model and EC observations, generating extra errors in estimating ET. This study endeavored to reduce the error caused by the spatial scale inconsistency between forcing data and ET measurements employing joint observations from EC system, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and satellites under the flux footprint theory and the Penman-Monteith (P-M) model. The joint observations were performed in 2020 at the LuanCheng (LES) and YuCheng (YES) sites. Surface conductance for the varying flux footprint climatology was retrieved from EC observations using the inverted P-M model. The vegetation indices from various remote sensing platforms, including UAV, MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2, were retrieved and employed to evaluate surface conductance and ET within the flux footprint climatology. The findings indicated that varying flux footprint climatology had a significant impact on the accuracy of ET estimation. The UAV, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2 data all generated good ET estimations (LES: R2 > 0.72, RMSE < 0.81 mm day−1; YES: R2 > 0.74, RMSE < 0.91 mm day−1) in the 80 % and 90 % flux footprint climatology.

However, the contribution of conservation and regenerative farming practices, including cover cropping, on energy and C footprints have not yet been documented for cropping systems in arid and semi-arid regions. This study evaluated the energy and C footprint of cover crop integrated silage maize (Zea mays L.) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) production systems in the semi-arid region of the southwestern US. The treatments were mixtures of winter cover crops: i) grasses and legumes (GL), ii) grasses, brassicas, and legumes (GBL), iii) grasses and brassicas (GB), and iv) no cover crops (NCC) control for each crop production system. Results showed cover crops had 24.1–24.5% greater energy input than NCC. In silage maize rotation, energy output was 17–22% greater in GBL and GL than in NCC. In silage sorghum rotation, the energy output was 15–24% greater in all cover crops than in NCC. The resulting net energy was 16–21% greater in GBL and GL than in NCC under silage maize, while it was 18–24% greater in GBL and GB than in NCC under silage sorghum. In the silage maize system, the C-footprint per kg yield was not different among treatments, whereas in silage sorghum, it was 58% greater in GBL than in NCC. The benefit-to-cost ratio was greater than one for all treatments, but the additional revenue through C credit programs could make cover cropping a more feasible and beneficial approach, improving economic and environmental sustainability while producing silage crops. While the C footprint was crop rotation specific, cover cropping should be encouraged over crop-fallow systems to producers in semi-arid environments to reduce energy usage and increase C-credit benefits. Clear national and state policy on the C credit program will also enhance economic and environmental benefits by adopting cover cropping and other regenerative farming practices.",6,,

However, there is a lack of a comprehensive accounting approach tailored to the construction features of prefabricated buildings. To address this issue, this study develops a framework to account the life-cycle carbon footprint of prefabricated buildings within the circular economy principles. The developed framework is applied to a prefabricated building in Chengdu, China, revealing that a significant carbon footprint is attributed to the material production and transportation stages. Moreover, an uncertainty analysis is conducted based on Data Quality Indicator evaluation method and Monte Carlo Simulation to validate the accounting framework, and a minor deviation of 0.085 % between the uncertain and calculated values validates the proposed accounting framework. Furthermore, key processes to mitigate the carbon footprint are identified. The results show that cast-in-place concrete is a key process at the construction materials level. Building upon these findings, this study offers recommendations on accurately and efficiently accounting the carbon footprint of prefabricated buildings. The research findings contribute to fostering the accounting of the life-cycle carbon footprint for prefabricated buildings, establishing a theoretical and empirical basis for circular economy implementation in prefabricated buildings, and offering insights for making informed carbon emission reduction decisions in prefabricated buildings.",,,

Additionally, individual citizens struggle to connect with community targets. This study addresses these issues by computing a comprehensive carbon footprint pathway that, as a main contribution, can be easily personalized and associated with common carbon footprint calculators. This approach innovatively leverages inverted “S-shaped” patterns based on logistic functions that, unlike common linear patterns, have been documented as relevant for diffusion mechanisms of social or ecological transformations. One challenge lies in efficiently aligning the carbon footprint figures, expressed in CO2eq, with IPCC's +2 °C carbon budgets, expressed in CO2-only. This work first retrieves the current share of CO2-only footprint and then defines two mitigation pathways: one focusing solely on CO2 emissions and one addressing residual GHGs. Except for initial and final emission levels, both targeted pathways are defined by the same logistic function, based on the assumed intrinsic link between CO2 and the other GHGs. As final targets, the CO2-only pathway considers the common net-zero emission goal while the second pathway considers a level of 1 tCO2eq/year per capita of unmitigated non-CO2 emissions, in alignment with IPCC's latest assumptions and anticipated population growth. Besides the new +2 °C compatible suggested pathways, developing this method for France and Wallonia has also revealed that they should reach territorial (nature-based) carbon uptake of at least three times their current levels, necessitating deep land-use changes in their policies (implementing intensive urban vegetation, alternative agriculture techniques, etc).",,,

The study found that a 1% increase in CFBL is associated with a 0.15% increase in ecological footprint, whereas a 1% increase in TFFS is correlated with a 0.80% increase in ecological footprint. This suggests that fossil fuel subsidies have a larger detrimental impact on the ecological footprint compared to CFBL. The results provide evidence of an asymmetric relationship between CFBL, TFFS, and ecological footprints. Specifically, CFBL has a significant positive association with ecological footprint, with a 1% increase in CFBL associated with a 0.01% increase in ecological footprint, while a 1% decrease in CFBL results in a 0.002% increase in ecological footprint. TFFS has a more pronounced impact on ecological footprint, with a 1% increase associated with a 0.14% decrease and a 1% decrease associated with a 0.30% decrease, which is twice as large. The findings suggest that positive shocks in environmental taxation lead to a 0.54% decrease in ecological footprints, while negative shocks have a profoundly detrimental effect with a 1.33% increase in ecological footprints. Additionally, the interaction effect indicates that the effectiveness of CFBL and TFFS on ecological footprints is contingent on the level of environmental tax. The result shows that with a 1% increase in environmental tax, the negative impact of CFBL and TFFS on ecological footprints decreases by 0.02% and 0.09%, respectively. These findings underscore the importance of reducing carbon emissions and fossil fuel subsidies and implementing effective environmental taxation policies to promote sustainability and mitigate environmental damage.",,,

A prerequisite for managing and controlling the carbon footprint is calculating and visualizing it transparently. In this work, a general framework for live estimating the carbon footprint for production processes is presented. The framework is used to investigate the carbon footprint of additively manufactured components. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in the straightforwardness of the general framework with a holistic data model. With this it is possible to compare different Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) methods and assumptions of new additively manufactured parts, as all data and methods are integrated from data acquisition at the machine to balancing compactly. A demonstrator is developed that calculates the consumption of energy and materials in real-time. The demonstrator consists of a AM machine, sensors for measuring all consumption, data processing in the back end, and a user-friendly dashboard in the front end. Due to different assumptions and calculation methods, there is a high variation in the final result of the carbon footprint calculation, which is presented in this paper.",,647,30th CIRP Life Cycle Engineering Conference
JOUR,The role of incentive policies and personal innovativeness in consumers' carbon footprint tracking apps adoption in China,"['Cudjoe, Dan', 'Zhu, Bangzhu', 'Wang, Hong']",Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services,79,103861,2024,2024/07/01/,0969-6989,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jretconser.2024.103861,['https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698924001577'],"['Carbon footprint', 'Tracking apps', 'Incentive policies', 'Personal innovativeness', 'Sustainable production', 'Cleaner consumption']","The annual global greenhouse gas emissions are predicted to increase by 124% in 2030, higher than what is required to decrease the global temperature. China is the leading source of carbon emissions related to consumption and has become the focal point of worldwide efforts to lower carbon emissions. Using applications that monitor individual consumption and offer emissions reports will aid consumers in effectively controlling and mitigating their carbon footprint. There is a dearth of consumer understanding regarding the consequences of their everyday consumption-related carbon emissions. This paper uses Shanghai as the study area to assess the variables that encourage consumers to use carbon footprint monitoring applications in China. The integrated technology acceptance model (TAM) and theory of planned behaviour (TPB) were expanded to include personal innovativeness and incentive policies to achieve this aim. In total, 571 responses to legitimate questionnaires were collected. An empirical assessment was conducted using a structural equation modeling to examine the variables impacting consumers' usage of carbon footprint monitoring applications. The results suggest that personal innovativeness, incentive policies, attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease-of-use influence consumers' usage of carbon footprint monitoring applications positively and significantly. The research outcomes provide complete insight into consumer behaviour concerning adopting carbon footprint tracking apps. Besides, the study offers policy implications for decision-makers and potential stakeholders.",,,
JOUR,Estimation of the carbon footprint of arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs in France,"['Rougereau, Grégoire', 'Chatelain, Léonard', 'Zadegan, Frédéric', 'Conso, Christel']",Orthopaedics & Traumatology: Surgery & Research,110,103755,2024,2024/02/01/,1877-0568,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.otsr.2023.103755,['https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877056823003031'],"['Carbon footprint', 'Shoulder', 'Rotator cuff', 'Arthroscopy']","Aim The main objective of this study was to estimate the carbon impact of arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs in France. The secondary objective was to assess the effectiveness of the following measures in reducing the carbon footprint associated with this technique: outpatient treatment, arthroscopic water filtration, surgery under locoregional anesthesia. Hypothesis The hypothesis was that the carbon footprint could be significantly improved with the implementation of these three procedures. Methods A continuous series of 26 patients who underwent surgery for a rotator cuff tear involving only one tendon between November 2020 and April 2021 were included. The evaluation protocol consisted of three parts: 1/ use of volatile anesthetic agents; 2/ electrical consumption linked to the procedure; 3/ emissions related to patient and staff travel, delivery of implants and waste management. Another series of 26 patients operated between November 2018 and April 2019 who had none of these three factors were matched. Results The carbon impact of arthroscopic repair of the rotator cuff was estimated at 334.61±18.82kgCO2eq. The implementation of the three methods for improvement made it possible to significantly reduce emissions by 40.9±1.71kgCO2eq (12.2%) (p<0.001). Conclusion Performing surgery under locoregional anesthesia, on an outpatient basis with water purification, reduces the carbon impact of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair by more than 12%. Level of evidence III, retrospective case control.",1,,

To make an adequate estimate of this relationship, a Quantile Regression is proposed, obtaining significantly different results to those derived from the usual estimations using ordinary least squares (OLS), which have been carried out up to now. This fact is fundamental for the correct planning and evaluation of fiscal policies based on income taxation to reduce the carbon footprint. Our results confirm that the OLS estimation would overestimate the effects of income on CO2 reduction by 26%.",6,,
