JOUR,Decoupling trend and drivers between grain water‑carbon footprint and economy-ecology development in China,"['Sun, Jingxin', 'Sun, Shikun', 'Yin, Yali', 'Wang, Yubao', 'Zhao, Jinfeng', 'Tang, Yihe', 'Wu, Pute']",Agricultural Systems,217,103904,2024,2024/05/01/,0308-521X,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2024.103904,['https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X24000544'],"['Grain water‑carbon footprint', 'Economy-ecology', 'Decoupling assessment', 'Tapio decoupling model', 'Decoupling drivers', 'LMDI model']","CONTEXT Agriculture is not only the basic guarantee for human survival, but also the basis for the economy development and ecology construction. Water use and carbon emissions in grain production will largely determine China's transition to “green”. OBJECTIVE On the basis of finding out how much water is consumed and how much carbon is emitted by grain cultivation, and then finding out whether and what extent water use and carbon emissions affect economic-ecological development in China. METHODS This study uses the Tapio decoupling model to calculate the decoupling status of the grain water‑carbon footprint and economic-ecological development in mainland China from 1998 to 2020. Then the Logarithmic Mean Division Index (LMDI) model is used to analyze the drivers of the change of water-economy decoupling status. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS The results show that the grain water‑carbon footprint is well decoupled from economic development, most decoupling states are absolute decoupling (−3<e<0) and relative decoupling ① (0<e<1). The grain water‑carbon footprint decoupled from ecological development is weak, and the decoupling coefficient has significant spatio-temporal differences. The agricultural production technology is the main positive driver for the decoupling between grain water footprint and economic development in mainland China (−1<eB<0). And the economic development scale is the main restraining factor for the decoupling between grain water footprint and economic development (0<eC<1). All provinces in mainland China need to correctly handle the relationship between economy-ecology development and grain security, and take water conservation and carbon emission reduction as an important starting point for adjusting the industrial structure, so as to achieve “green” development. SIGNIFICANCE The grain water‑carbon footprint was calculated in an integrated manner, and then based on the calculation of the decoupling situation, the drivers of the decoupling situation were further assessed.",,,

There is a need to identify energy and carbon efficient cropping systems that reduce GHG emission and improve environmental quality. Using life cycle assessment (LCA), we evaluated the four cropping systems namely fallow – chickpea (F–C); Sesbania – mustard (Ses–M); blackgram – chickpea (B–C); sorghum + cowpea – mustard (S + C–M) cultivated during the 2018–2022 period. The energy use pattern and the input-output relationship were analysed. Three measures were utilized to quantify carbon footprints: CFa, which denotes emissions per unit area; CFb, indicating emissions per kilogram of yield; and CFe, representing emissions per unit of economic output. The result indicates that non-renewable sources of energy (diesel and fertilizer) contributed more than ∼80 % of the total energy consumed in the different cropping systems. The total energy requirement was the highest for S + C–M (16,972 MJ ha–1), followed by Ses–M (14,365 MJ ha–1), B–C (11,132 MJ ha–1) and F–C (8679 MJ ha–1) cropping systems. The S + C–M cropping system also had the highest energy use efficiency (9.13) followed by F–C (6.03), B–C (5.41) and Ses–M (5.41). The fallow–chickpea cropping system had the lowest values of CFa, CFb, and CFe however, the highest carbon efficiency (10.7) and the carbon sustainability index (9.7) were computed in S + C–M cropping system. Our findings indicate that thoughtfully structured, varied crop systems that integrate legumes and forage crops have the potential to significantly reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions, while sustaining or potentially improving overall productivity within these systems.",,,

The relative lack of carbon footprint analyses of urban public transportation systems (UPTS) is therefore surprising, given that UPTS is an important component of urban transportation and one that may play a crucial role in carbon emission reduction. This study conducts a spatio-temporal analysis of carbon footprints for UPTS during the COVID-19 pandemic based on smart card data in Beijing. Since the core of carbon footprint calculation is to estimate travellers' trip trajectories and the ridership of urban rail transit (URT) and buses, we construct a novel multi-layer urban rail network model to calculate passenger volume and travellers' trajectories through a traffic assignment model. Furthermore, we utilize the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to analyse the correlation relationship between the carbon footprints of buses and URT. Additionally, we conduct statistical analysis of the carbon footprint of UPTS. The results of the spatio-temporal analysis of carbon footprints for UPTS show significantly lower carbon emissions during holidays compared to those on working days, and emissions during peak hours contribute approximately half of the total daily UPTS emissions, while there are notable variations in the distribution of the carbon footprint among different districts. Moreover, our analysis reveals a positive correlation between the carbon footprints of buses and URT. The statistical analysis reflects different patterns of carbon footprint distribution on different dates during the pandemic, but the carbon footprint distributions on selected dates all follow a power-law distribution. This study may facilitate the understanding to the impacts of UPTS on the environment during the COVID-19 pandemic, and also provide important guidance and reference for the development of carbon emission reduction strategies.",,,

With growing concerns over climate change and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the transition to electric vehicles and clean energy sources has gained significant attention as potential solutions. This research investigates the relationship between the adoption of EVs and clean energy technologies and their subsequent effect on carbon footprints. The study applied the Generalised Method Moments (GMM) on the data sourced from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the World Development Indicators (WDI) for the period 2011–2021 covering 27 countries. The findings reveal a strong correlation between the adoption of EVs and reductions in carbon footprints. It shows that a 1 % increase in renewable electricity output would result in a 0.5 % decline in carbon footprints. This implies that, as EV sales increase, the overall carbon emissions from the transportation sector decrease, primarily due to the lower emissions associated with electric vehicles compared to conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. Additionally, the study finds that the integration of clean energy sources into the electricity grid further contributes to carbon footprint reductions. The use of renewable energy in charging EVs minimizes the indirect emissions associated with electricity generation. The research concludes that the widespread adoption of EVs and clean energy sources has the potential to significantly reduce carbon footprints and mitigate the impact of climate change. However, it emphasizes the importance of continued technological advancements, increased availability of charging infrastructure, and supportive government policies to accelerate the transition towards a low-carbon transportation and energy system. Therefore, the study highlights the need for collaborative efforts among governments, industry stakeholders, and individuals to foster sustainable practices and achieve a more environmentally friendly future.",,,
JOUR,Life cycle carbon footprint accounting of an offshore wind farm in Southeast China—Simplified models and carbon benchmarks for typhoons,"['Sun, Zhen', 'You, Xianhui']",Applied Energy,355,122267,2024,2024/02/01/,0306-2619,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.122267,['https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261923016318'],"['Offshore wind farms', 'Carbon footprint accounting', 'Typhoons', 'Simplified models', 'Carbon benchmarks']","Offshore wind farms are fast-spreading off the southeast coast of China to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. However, unfavorable weather conditions in Southeast China (e.g. frequent typhoons and severe wind intermittency) may increase the carbon footprint of offshore wind energy. But typhoons have never been considered in carbon accounting before, which may affect the design decisions of stakeholders and research priority setting for academicians. (i) To determine the effect of typhoons on carbon footprint, a life cycle assessment was performed on a typical offshore wind farm using real data. The results demonstrate that typhoons can be the largest contributor to carbon footprint, and the maximum wind speed of typhoons is the most critical parameter to carbon footprint. (ii) To quantify the carbon emissions caused by typhoons, simplified models estimating carbon emission intensity under different maximum wind speeds of typhoons are established, using Monte Carlo method based on 51 historical typhoons. The models imply that wind turbines with Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) are highly recommended in typhoon-prone area, because their carbon footprint is smaller than those with Doubly-Fed Induction Generator (DFIG). (iii) To set carbon benchmarks for typhoons, statistic analysis was conducted based on the simulated samples generated by Monte Carlo method. The carbon benchmarks of typhoons show that gearbox has the highest carbon emission intensity (mean=4.35g/kW, 95th percentile=7.00g/kW) among all components, resulting DFIG with gearbox not suitable in typhoon-areas. The site selection of offshore wind farms in Southeast China should avoid areas where the maximum wind speed of typhoons exceeds 44.5 m/s. This study emphasizes the importance of typhoons in carbon footprint accounting for offshore wind farms in Southeast China. More significantly, the proposed simplified models and carbon benchmarks of typhoons can be applied to feasibility studies in early design stage for engineers and stakeholders.",,,

This paper empirically explores the relationship between individual carbon footprints and carbon literacy as well as socio-economic and attitudinal factors. To operationalize carbon literacy, we distinguish between carbon knowledge and carbon engagement. Our econometric analysis uses widely representative survey data for 1000 individuals in Germany and distinguishes between components of an aggregate carbon footprint and of carbon footprints related with electricity consumption, heating, motorized individual transport, aviation, and dietary choices. We find a negative and sizeable correlation between carbon engagement and the aggregate footprint, as well as the footprints related to electricity consumption and diet. For example, a one-unit increase in our index reflecting carbon engagement corresponds to a decrease in the aggregate carbon footprint of about 4%. Furthermore, for carbon knowledge we find a negative correlation with the carbon footprint from diet. We also find significant correlations between the carbon footprints and gender, age, income, education, environmental preferences, and policy orientation, which generally exhibit the intuitively expected signs, but differ somewhat across activities. Overall, our findings support the notion that fostering carbon engagement represents a more effective strategy for reducing individuals' carbon footprints than enhancing carbon knowledge.",,,

As oil fields approach their expected service life and reach depletion, energy use and GHG emissions increase per unit of produced oil, shifting operations away from their optimal point. Thus, it is paramount that oil field life extension decisions account for energy use and GHG emissions. However, many facilities are having their service life extended without considering this energy inefficiency and previous life extension decision making studies have neglected GHG emissions. Addressing this issue, this paper proposes the inclusion of a carbon footprint assessment within the evaluation of oil and gas offshore production facility life extension. The carbon footprint assessment adds an environmental lens to the evaluation of ageing, formerly evaluated according to material degradation, obsolescence and organizational issues. An eleven-stage framework is proposed to systematize the ageing related carbon footprint assessment and support life extension decision-making: (1) Objective definition, (2) Scope definition, (3) Field conditions description, (4) Scope breakdown into manageable portions, (5) Detailed data collection for each process and subsystem, (6) Input and output definition for each process and subsystem, (7) Process modelling, (8) Methodology definition for energy demand and inefficiency estimate, (9) Monitoring indicator definition, (10) Performance evaluation, and (11) Interpretation of results. The proposed framework is applied to a hypothetical case study, developed with data from a typical oil and gas offshore production platform operated in Brazil. Two LE improvement strategies were simulated, i.e. reducing the number of gas turbines, and increasing the export of natural gas. Both alter the modus operandi of the compression system and do not require additional equipment installation. These strategies resulted in a combined reduction of 922,000 tCO2 during the extended 10-year operation. This outcome demonstrates that by applying the framework opportunities for reducing energy use and GHG emissions during life extension can be identified and quantified, facilitating life extension decision-making.",,,

This expansion offers promising prospects for advancing environmental sustainability through green finance, which can be an excellent tool. In this respect, this research examines how green finance affects the carbon footprint in BRICS+6 economies. Earlier studies used panel data techniques to probe the association between these variables but overlooked that certain countries still needed to possess such a link separately. Hence, this research adopts the Quantile-on-Quantile approach, which provides a holistic universal view and customized findings for each country. The outcomes display that green finance improves environmental quality by diminishing carbon footprint at distinct quantiles of data distribution.",2,375,

There are many issues that need to be discussed and solved in the carbon footprint accounting of wool products. In this paper, key issues such as system boundary, calculation method, accounting data, and allocation method are analyzed and discussed to accurately account for the carbon footprint of wool products. The results show that when accounting for the partial carbon footprint of wool products, the system boundary endpoint of the “gate” is more operable. The model estimation method used to calculate the carbon footprint of sheep rumination needs further improvement in feed intake prediction and methane conversion coefficient. Clarifying the carbon sequestration and carbon transfer mechanism and accurately tracing the source of carbon elements in wool can quantify the carbon sequestration effect of wool products. The data should be prioritized in the order of site-specific data, primary data, and secondary data. The protein mass allocation method can better allocate wool and co-products in the raw material production stage. A full and systematic analysis of the key issues of the carbon footprint accounting for wool products can ensure the effectiveness and comparability of the carbon footprint accounting results and contribute to the green and low-carbon development of the wool industry.",,,

Assessments of both producer (upstream) and consumer (downstream) ecological and socioeconomic impacts of urban inter-industry exchanges are needed to reduce energy consumption and resource use behind the industrial footprints of cities. Environmental extensions in the input-output analysis are designed from the user side perspective, focusing only on commercial energy supply and use. This study introduced emergy-evaluated supply-extended and use-extended carbon footprint models for Vienna and compared their empirical and conceptual implications. Emergy-evaluated footprints of Vienna's urban consumption were estimated by combining industrial and systems ecology approaches as per the research question, based on previous investigations of GHG emissions and energy supply- and use-extensions. Results showed that the ranking of footprints of final product categories is sensitive to the evaluation method, with products of extractive and manufacturing industries differing by more than 10% depending on whether emergy or carbon evaluation is chosen. The emergy-based comparison further reveals that for products of extractive industries, the difference between use and supply extension results can be more than 20% as opposed to carbon-based comparison with the difference between supply and use extension results for services not even amounting to 5%. Future studies could address the over-estimation of direct energy supply to the economy, under-estimation of product and service, inconsistency in standard use-extension design, and challenges in assembling emergy-evaluated supply and use extensions.

The learning model utilizes the boundary representation of CAD models for deeper understandings of the CAD model shape. The proposed method trains the deep learning model on the existing CAD models to recognize important sub-shapes and attributes, including materials and manufacturing information, such as welded parts, which are the essential data for the carbon footprint estimation. The proposed method enables the designers to estimate the carbon footprint without the laborious condition setting, which facilitates concurrent monitoring and improvement of the carbon footprint.

Utilizing instrumental regression analysis, it examines the consensus mechanisms—Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS)—and their association with carbon footprint. The findings reveal a clear correlation between the adoption of PoW-based cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and carbon emissions. Notably, PoW-based cryptocurrencies generate approximately 0.86 metric tons of carbon emissions per transaction, which is significantly higher than PoS-based transactions like Ethereum. Concerns also arise regarding the sustainability of Bitcoin mining after the fourth halving period and potential shortages in PoW-based mining resources. As mining rewards decrease, the challenge of timely block creation intensifies. By projecting future BTC mining phases, the study anticipates diminishing rewards in each halving period, potentially leaving around 2500 BTC units available for mining by 2120. This suggests that achieving the full 21 million BTC may prove practically unattainable within the current blockchain framework. Furthermore, the research highlights the speculative and risky nature of cryptocurrencies lacking regulatory oversight, which tends to attract irresponsible investors. It stresses the importance of developing a nuanced understanding of the environmental implications of PoW cryptocurrencies and advocating for responsible innovation.

This initiative aims to usher consumers towards more environmentally-conscious purchasing decisions by providing insights into the ecological impact of their food choices. Our comprehensive research explores a variety of determinants that sway Taiwanese consumers in their buying behaviors, specifically focusing on the influence of these carbon footprint labels. Surprisingly, while one might anticipate media exposure to be a dominant force in shaping opinions, our findings suggest its role remains relatively limited in this context. Instead, personal experiences with climate events and robust influences from family and peers emerge as the primary drivers in purchasing decisions. These direct interpersonal interactions, both in terms of shared experiences and word-of-mouth recommendations, offer profound insights into shaping consumer behavior. As Taiwan ambitiously targets net-zero emissions by 2050, harnessing the power of these social dynamics becomes imperative.

Based on 454 farm surveys on the North and Northeast China Plain, the carbon footprint (CF) of two farmland ecosystems (irrigated system for wheat and maize on the North China Plain and rainfed system for maize on the Northeast Plain) were assessed and emission reduction pathways explored by quantifying greenhouse gas emissions of agricultural inputs and farm practices during the entire crop growing seasons with an agricultural footprint model. The results demonstrated that the GHG emissions from wheat and maize rotation in the irrigated system were 7.63 t CO2 eq ha−1 and 3.17 t CO2 eq ha−1 for single season maize in the rainfed system. While energy consumption accounted for 12.5%–21.3% of the carbon footprint in both systems, the group assessment found that the largest difference in GHG emissions between the high and low emission groups came from mechanical energy consumption. Approximately 50.6% and 39.2% of the mechanical carbon footprint of wheat and maize, respectively, were caused by irrigation practices in the irrigated system. Regarding the rainfed system, where 46.6% of mechanical carbon emissions were generated by maize tillage operations. In addition, scenario analysis indicated that the mechanical carbon footprint could be reduced to 56 kg CO2 eq t−1 for NCP-wheat and 26 kg CO2 eq t−1 for NCP-maize, respectively, by optimizing yields and irrigation practices in irrigated systems and that the mechanical carbon footprint of NEP-maize could be reduced to 25 kg CO2 eq t−1 by optimizing yields and tillage practices in rainfed systems. Therefore, improvement in mechanization in irrigation and tillage practices can contribute to reduce GHG emissions in China.

The carbon footprint for craft brewing was calculated for a wide range of packaging types across three realistic scenarios (low, medium, and high carbon footprints) based on collected data and addresses the discrepancies between values reported in previous literature. Overall, the calculated carbon footprints ranged between 205 (20 L steel kegs, low carbon footprint scenario) and 1483 (single-use, 0.33 L glass bottles, high carbon footprint scenario) gCO2e per litre of beer. Novel hotspots (including wort boiling, the packaging process in a brewery, and the contribution of secondary and tertiary packaging) were identified. The overwhelming contribution of Scope 3 emissions (contributing between 57 and 95 % of the total carbon footprint) further emphasised the need to provide increased knowledge to craft breweries.",,,

The stated choice experiment, used for evaluation, was designed combining a set of alternatives, characterised by carbon footprint reduction and offset policies, taking into account the existence of environmental direct benefits, but also indirect benefits that improve tourist experience or co-benefits derived from the location of policy projects. Economic welfare in form of willingness to pay (WTP) was estimated, and the alternatives were compared using compensating variation values. The study's findings validate the prevailing preference for carbon reduction policies over offsetting measures, except when the first don't have co-benefits and the latter are implemented locally. In the latter case, there is no significant difference in WTP between reducing the carbon footprint and locally offsetting it.

Notably, we determine that the ecological footprint across sectors and countries is diverging, or at best, slowly converging at a pace that is not even close to that required to meet the 2030 SDGs. Therefore, policymakers and practitioners must strategically revise sustainability policies to ensure industrial and economic transition and adaptability to climate change and advance economic green growth and sustainable development.",,,

We have developed an algorithm for a dynamic estimation of these fluxes based on a net production DEB growth model for mussels. The resulting model has been implemented in Python to create a toolbox with a graphical user interface. This toolbox allows the selection of different culture strategies, in terms of seeding date, seed size and culture length, and consequently analyzes the carbon footprint and impact on the carbonate chemistry of seawater of aquaculture management.",,,

Here, we explore the limitations of this proportionality assumption. We provide a systematic framework for discussing the gap between the true carbon footprint and the carbon footprint imputed with spending, a framework which is valid for any type of footprint. We show that two channels can bias the distribution of the carbon footprint: the heterogeneity in prices paid and the heterogeneity in the carbon intensity of products purchased. We rely on French household budget survey data to illustrate how these channels operate and interplay, and use cooking oils as a case study of the interplay of the two channels. We find that wealthier households pay higher prices. Because of the price heterogeneity, the carbon footprint tends to be overestimated for top income and underestimated at the bottom. We also use consumption of cooking oils as a more-in depth case study of the carbon intensity heterogeneity. This case shows that it can lead to an outcome similar to price heterogeneity.",,,

Thus, this study utilizes the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) method to explore the impact of electricity intensity (EINT), renewable energy in electricity generation (ERE), and gross domestic product (GDP) on Malaysia's environmental quality, from 1985 to 2020. By using carbon emissions (CO2 emissions) and ecological footprint (EF) as proxies, the study finds a significant long-run impact of these factors on environmental degradation. Notably, the study also observed an inverted U-shaped relationship between GDP and environmental degradation, validating the existence of Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. The findings also imply that while electricity intensity is associated with increased emissions, the use of renewable energy (RE) sources for electricity generation may contribute to emission reduction. But the results for both variables show reversal signs on EF. The study's adoption of the fully ordinary least square (FMOLS) method reinforces the same results, thus, justifying the cointegrating relationship between studied variables. Drawing from these outcomes, the study advocates for a comprehensive approach to renewable energy management, emphasizing both its utilization and waste in order to improve ecological footprint.

The high cost of evaluating pruning quantities by destructive measurements has limited the research on pruning. By combining terrestrial laser scanning and quantitative structure models, pruning quantities can be assessed non-destructively. This study focuses on the impact of pruning during tree production, as it is intense and has been rarely evaluated. Using Sophora japonica from a nursery in Beijing as an example, point cloud data were collected from 181 uneven-aged Sophora japonica for the simulation of pruning at a single tree level. All pruning stages were incorporated into the assessment of the carbon footprint of Sophora japonica production for 15-year-old trees. The results show that previous studies have underestimated the tree carbon footprints of pruning, leading to a severe underestimation of the carbon footprint of tree production. Crown reduction removes the most above-ground woody biomass during tree production, over half, while the decomposition of pruning waste is the most significant source of carbon emissions. The removal ratio from pruning of individual trees is consistent within the same pruning pattern. The tree volume can serve as a good predictor for estimating pruning quantities, but crown diameter sometimes needs to be considered. Implementing pruning interventions, harvesting in advance, and choosing appropriate methods for pruning waste disposal can reduce carbon emissions from pruning.",,,

Three DCAs were modified into two distinct particle groups through sieving: fine particles for cement replacement, evaluated against a ternary cementitious binder with fly ash (FA) and flue gas desulfurization gypsum (FG) using Response surface methodology (RSM), and coarse particles for aggregate treatment. The modified DCA mixes and conventional cement-treated base (CTB) mix were compared for environmental and economic benefits through cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment. The results indicate that replacing fine DCA optimized setting time and compressive strength based on its chemical composition, aligning with FA and FG in the RSM process. A 25 % cement replacement with fine DCA balanced the mechanical properties of the modified cement, while a 50 % replacement with coarse DCA effectively improved aggregate properties compared to natural crushed rock. Modified DCA enhanced pavement engineering properties, surpassing the strength and resilience benchmarks of CTB mix. Utilizing optimal modified DCA mixes could reduce carbon footprint and costs by approximately 40 % and 44 %, respectively. Hence, the outcomes highlight challenges and opportunities for modifying DCA for resource conservation and low-carbon transportation infrastructure.",,,

Understanding the factors driving this phenomenon is crucial for mitigating the carbon footprint of agricultural production. Nevertheless, comprehending the carbon flow of the agricultural industry within China remained insufficient. Furthermore, quantifying the driving forces behind ACF and carbon flow for a single year posed a significant challenge. In this study, we aim to uncover the distribution and flow pattern of the carbon footprint in China's agricultural industry using a multi-regional input-output model. Moreover, we introduce a novel approach by employing geographical detectors to analyze the influencing factors from a spatial heterogeneity perspective. The results reveal that China's ACF in 2015 amounted to 48,826.69 thousand tons of carbon equivalents (CO2eq). The ACF was generally higher in the northern regions and lower in the central areas. A Jevons paradox phenomenon was observed in Shandong, where ACF was higher, and agricultural carbon emission intensity was lower, suggesting that improvements in agricultural efficiency can paradoxically lead to increased carbon emissions. Notably, 39.39% of ACF was involved in regional transfers. The primary flow of agricultural carbon occurred from northern to southeastern coastal areas, with Guangdong (4447.49 thousand tons of CO2eq) and Heilongjiang (−2225.25 thousand tons of CO2eq) being the leading inflow and outflow provinces, respectively. Socioeconomic and agricultural factors played a significant role in shaping the distribution of ACF and its inter-regional transmission. Socioeconomic factors, including GDP, population, industry structure, and educational expenditure, predominantly influenced inflow ACF. Meanwhile, agricultural factors related to land use and grain output primarily affected outflow ACF. Suggestions for reducing carbon footprint in the agricultural sector was proposed based on the condition of ACF and flow types, from the production and consumption aspects. Provinces of ACF inflow and outflow should share the responsibility for reducing ACF, potentially through carbon trading and reciprocal technological assistance. This study offers substantial theoretical value by providing a comprehensive understanding of the spatial flow and driving factors of ACF within China's agricultural sector.",,,

However, achieving effluent discharge standards often requires considerable energy and chemical consumption during operation, resulting in significant carbon footprints. In this study, GHG emissions are systematically accounted for, and the driving factors of carbon footprint growth in China’s MWWTPs are explored. In 2020, a total of 41.9 million tons (Mt) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) were released by the sector, with nearly two-thirds being indirect emissions resulting from energy and material usage. The intensity of electricity, carbon source, and phosphorus removing agent consumption increasingly influence carbon footprint growth over time. Through statistical inference, benchmarks for electricity and chemical consumption intensity are established across all MWWTPs under various operational conditions, and the potential for mitigation through more efficient energy and material utilization is calculated. The results suggest that many MWWTPs offer significant opportunities for emission reduction. Consequently, empirical decarbonization measures, including intelligent device control, optimization of aeration equipment, energy recovery initiatives, and other enhancements to improve operational and carbon efficiency, are recommended.",,,

Awareness of carbon sources and quantification of the waste are two key parameters. To our knowledge, there is no study in France on waste production by the surgical team during the operation in orthopedic surgery, in a global scope. Therefore, we performed an observational investigation aiming to: (1) quantify and characterize the weight of the wastes generated after a panel of orthopedic procedures, (2) calculate the CO2 footprint generated by these wastes and extrapolate the figure at the national scale. Hypothesis Waste production is highly variable according to the types of procedures and infectious clinical waste is still a predominant source of waste and CO2 emission. Materials and methods It is a comparative and prospective study in which a total of 14 procedures were selected as a representative panel: arthroplasties (hip, knee), spine fusions, arthroscopic procedures (shoulder, knee), nerve release, forefoot osteotomies, trauma procedures. The main outcome was the average total weight of waste for each of the fourteen categories (280 measurements: 140 times 2, at the end of each procedure), expressed in kilograms (kg), and the proportions of infectious clinical waste (ICW) and household wastes (HW), expressed in percentages. Ten measures were prospectively recorded for each type of procedure in a single teaching hospital from January to September 2022. The theoretical carbon footprint generated by the treatment of the wastes was estimated in kilograms of CO2 equivalent (KgEqCO2). The national extrapolation of the carbon footprint was performed by collecting the total number of procedures in France in 2021 using the VisuChir tool. Results A total of 937kg of waste were produced for the 140 procedures, amongst which 514kg of ICW (54.8%) and 423kg of HW (45.2%). The overall median waste weight was 5.9kg (Q1: 4.4, Q3: 8.1), ranging from 1.8kg to 18.3kg. The overall median waste weight for HW was 2.8kg (Q1: 2.5, Q3: 3.4), ranging from 1.8kg to 17.8kg. The overall median waste weight for ICW was 3.8kg (Q1: 2.7, Q3: 4.8), ranging from 0.8kg to 7.2kg. The knee surgeries were responsible for the heaviest waste weight; the least waste-productive procedures were the foot and the carpal tunnel release. The median proportions of ICW varied from 39% for the total knee replacements to 72% for the femoral nails. There was a significant inverse correlation between the total waste weight and the proportion of ICW: r=−0.47, p<10−4. The total median estimated carbon footprint was 4.3KgCO2Eq (Q1: 3.1, Q3: 5.8), ranging from 1.59KgCO2Eq (Q1: 1.5, Q3: 1.8) and 7.07KgCO2Eq (Q1: 6.7, Q3: 8.17). The total median estimated carbon footprint was 3.5KgCO2Eq for ICW (Q1: 2.5, Q3: 4.5) and 0.76KgCO2Eq (Q1: 0.54, Q3: 1.3) for HW. The national median estimated carbon footprint was 10.1 million KgEqCO2 in 2021 for orthopedic surgery. Conclusion Our study revealed that in most cases more than half of the wastes were ICW. The total estimated national carbon footprint for orthopedic procedures was 10 million kilograms. The reduction of the ICW constitutes a cornerstone, as they are responsible for more carbon emissions. Level of evidence III; prospective comparative observational in vivo study.",,,

Yet, they increase prices especially in the short term, and can affect households’ income depending on their carbon footprints. Cash transfer programs can be used to address adverse social impacts and protect the poorest. However, because carbon footprints, and the consequent tax impacts, may change over time it is important to understand how to design and adapt such cash transfer programs accordingly. As the existing studies focus on single years, we address the gap in the literature in two steps. First, we estimate changes in carbon footprints and their drivers over time; second, we simulate the effects of a carbon tax in combination with cash transfers on poverty and inequality for the years 2004, 2007 and 2011 in Peru. We combine a bottom-up household carbon footprint estimation, and multiple scenarios simulation. We show that, in a context of rapid economic growth, footprints increase over time, particularly for lower deciles. Most importantly, the distributional impacts of a reform combining carbon tax and cash transfers change by year. The paper concludes that, to maximize poverty and inequality reduction, the design of cash transfer programs and tax levels need to be adapted over time.",,,

This is mainly because the key pollutants in Pakistan's energy sector come from nonrenewable sources, such as coal and natural gas. However, the report observes that the carbon emissions within the nonrenewable energy sector are directly related to economic growth.

Since capturing the full lifecycle emissions of goods and services at the city level can be methodologically challenging due to the fact that cities have multiple sources of emissions (e.g. transportation, waste, buildings), our study focused on evaluating the carbon footprint of various types of urban buildings across six sectors. This evaluation was conducted in one of the most rapidly urbanized cities in the Middle East, Doha City, Qatar, and was based on electricity consumption data from 2017 to 2020. Using multiregional input–output life cycle assessment (MRIO-LCA) and hot/coldspot analysis, this study identified CF emission spatiotemporal patterns and the major buildings responsible for the highest emissions. The results indicated that residential villas and the commercial sector had the highest electricity consumption and steady increases in CF emissions during the study period, whereas hotels had the lowest annual electricity consumption among all sectors. The study also identified significant CF emission hotspots from Doha residential buildings in the southwestern and northeastern areas. In contrast, the CF hotspots from commercial buildings were concentrated in the industrial area in the southern part of the city and in the West Bay area in the eastern part. Overall, the findings of this study provide important policy implications and a comprehensive assessment of dynamic changes in CF emissions from different building types.",,,

Radiotherapy contributes to this with potential sources quantified here. Method Activity data for 42 patients from within the breast IMRT and prostate VMAT pathways were collected. Data for 20 prostate patients was also collected from 3 other centres to enable cross centre comparison. A process-based, bottom-up approach was used to calculate the carbon footprint. Additionally, patients were split into pre-COVID and COVID groups to assess the impact of protocol changes due to the pandemic. Results The calculated carbon footprint for prostate and breast pre-COVID were 148 kgCO2e and 101 kgCO2e respectively, and 226 kgCO2e and 75 kgCO2e respectively during COVID. The energy usage by the linac during treatment for a total course of radiotherapy for prostate treatments was 2–3 kWh and about 1 kWh for breast treatments. Patient travel made up the largest proportion (70–80%) of the calculated carbon footprint, with linac idle power second with ∼ 10% and PPE and SF6 leakage were both between 2 and 4%. Conclusion These initial findings highlight that the biggest contributor to the external beam radiotherapy carbon footprint was patient travel, which may motivate increased used of hypofractionation. Many assumptions and boundaries have been set on the data gathered, which limit the wider application of these results. However, they provide a useful foundation for future more comprehensive life cycle assessments.",,,

The main objective of this evaluation is to examine the effects of different degrees of decentralization in production networks of the chemical industry. Using the production of a biopolymer as an example, the study includes strategic supply chain planning by agent-based simulations, economic evaluation by calculation of net present values and environmental assessment by calculation of carbon footprints. By allowing for dynamic reconfiguration of the decentralized networks over time, it is shown that mobile, modular plant concepts are beneficial to reduce supply chain expenses. Transportation efforts resulting from strategic supply chain planning are reduced by 40 % with increasing degree of decentralization. The profitability of the decentralized networks is dominated by the costs for the production processes themselves as capital and operational expenditures allocate to >50 % of the total costs. Product prices of 3000 to 5500 €2020 per ton are necessary to reach profitability of the decentralized production networks. Regarding the environmental assessment, the carbon footprint of the supply chain accounts for <3 % of the total emissions, which are dominated by the provision of process heat that accounts for 46 to 68 % of the total emissions. Carbon footprint of the decentral production networks can be significantly reduced by a systematic electrification of 90 % of the process heat demand.",,475,

Consequently, there is a pressing need for more granular data at the subnational level to formulate effective and feasible measures in line with current decarbonization targets. In this study, we present the carbon footprint embodied in household consumption behavior of 11 major metropolitan areas in Japan. Furthermore, our study innovatively introduces a temporal perspective, employing time organization as an insightful indicator to delineate the disparities in carbon footprints that arise from varying carbon intensities of distinct activities. The results are given from the following three aspects: 1) structural comparison of urban household carbon footprints; 2) time-based activity differences and drivers; and 3) inequality analysis among different activity-based carbon footprints. Here, we found that eating contributes most substantially to the carbon footprint. Conversely, transportation activities manifest the greatest regional inequality in carbon footprints. These findings provide indispensable evidence for the development of city-specific net-zero-emission goals within Japan. Furthermore, they exemplify the value of incorporating a temporal dimension into household carbon footprint analyses, thereby providing a broader perspective for future investigations in this field.",,,

Many studies have been conducted worldwide to evaluate the CF of rapeseed and its byproducts; however, only a few of these studies have considered finer-scale spatial-temporal heterogeneity. Considering the advantages of using detailed crop information extracted by remote sensing (RS) techniques, we attempted to integrate RS into life cycle assessments to improve rapeseed CF evaluation. A case study was conducted from 2021 to 2023 in one of the most important grain- and rapeseed-producing areas in Southwest China, namely, the Chengdu Plain, covering an area of 18,810.00 km2. The results of our study suggest that: (1) the proposed approach is applicable for high-resolution (10 m ∗ 10 m) rapeseed distribution mapping; (2) the farm-based CFs of rapeseed in the studied region range from 3333.08 to 4572.82 kgCO2-eq ha−1, while the product-based CFs (PCFs) vary from 1316.23 to 2443.95 kgCO2-eq t−1.

Based on remote-sensing data of night light, net primary productivity, and land use, the present study utilized the light‑carbon conversion and carbon footprint measurement models to quantify the carbon footprint of energy consumption. An exploratory spatiotemporal data analysis method was implemented to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution path. Panel quantile regression and spatiotemporal transition-nested models were used to reveal the influence mechanism of the spatiotemporal evolution of the carbon footprint. The following results were obtained. (1) The carbon footprint of counties increased from 2001 to 2020. Counties with high‑carbon footprint diffused around the “one center and two axes”. Carbon-deficit counties exhibited a diffused trend towards the west. In 2020, 506 counties exhibited carbon deficits, and the carbon balance of the ecosystem was severely unbalanced. (2) The carbon footprint showed evident path dependence and Matthew effect. The high‑carbon footprint lock-in area comprising 177 counties is a challenging zone for governance. The 86 counties that exhibit carbon footprint changes are the key zones to drive the carbon footprint changes in the Basin. The change direction of the county's carbon footprint type, with evident spatial correlation characteristics, is in accordance with adjacent counties. (3) The carbon footprint spatiotemporal transition types and influence mechanisms in counties exhibited significant differences, with the coexistence of low-carbon footprint driving, low-carbon footprint restriction, high-carbon footprint driving and high-carbon footprint restriction modes. As the influence mechanisms of different modes and the paths to achieve “dual carbon” goals are different, the governance of different modes should focus on optimizing and strengthening restriction factors or controlling and improving of driving factors.",,,

The database encompasses information from 212 dairy cattle farms situated in the temperate-humid zone of northern Spain, spanning the period from 2014 to 2018. Farm classification was based on the presence (CcMz) or absence (ScCMz) of maize cultivation for silage production, resulting in 96 farms in the CcMz category and 116 farms in the ScCMz category.

Carbon footprint tracking apps (CFTAs) seek to address this information gap by continuously educating consumers on their carbon emissions. Since the effectiveness of CFTAs has not yet been investigated at all, the authors developed a CFTA to explore whether and how such applications help shape consumption behavior. Over several survey rounds, 216 participants used the application to log their consumption in four main consumption domains. The results indicate that the feedback given can help decrease carbon emissions by 23%. The impact varies by consumption category, ranging from a 12% reduction in mobility to a 35% reduction in household activities. Moreover, individual traits influence the effectiveness of CFTA usage: Perceived green self-efficacy amplifies the feedback's effect, whereas a strong green self-identity diminishes it. Based on these results, the authors guide practitioners and academics on how to employ CFTAs to foster and research sustainable consumer behavior, and the authors show how to account for inter-individual differences when endorsing such apps. Future research should probe ways to boost effectiveness in specific areas and for particular personalities.",,,

Energy storage capacity buildup at all levels of the global energy system is expected to accelerate the decarbonization process. To this end, a coherent mathematical framework to ascertain the carbon footprint of localized energy systems with energy storage is indispensable. This article presents an open-source energy system simulation program — Energy System Network (ESN). A variety of energy system configurations can be simulated with the Python program, which incorporates key energy system components such as generation, grid, storage, and loads. ESN features an integrated bottom-up approach that combines energy system modeling with streamlined life cycle assessment techniques to quantify the carbon footprint of all components in a localized energy system. The lifecycle phases of each component, including production, operation, and end-of-life treatment, can be considered. Carbon footprint values are obtained for two demonstrative case studies with lithium-ion battery applications: energy arbitrage and home energy systems. The metric Levelized Emissions of Energy Supply (LEES) has been used to evaluate the carbon footprint of each application. An unconventional energy arbitrage strategy designed to exploit the grid carbon intensity spreads instead of the energy price spreads manages to achieve a LEES value about 17% lower than the conventional variant. The influence of rooftop solar generation, battery energy storage system, and the energy management strategy on the LEES values for a home energy system is explored. A maximum LEES reduction of over 37% vis-á-vis the base scenario was observed with optimal energy management for the solar generation and the battery system. The open-source availability of ESN can contribute to transparency, comparability, and reproducibility in carbon footprint assessments of localized energy systems with energy storage.",,,

Additionally, the carbon footprint fluctuates with processing states and equipment systems owing to the discontinuous process in LDMD involving the layer-by-layer deposition and the laser-powder coupling. This paper investigated dynamic carbon footprint based on the resource and energy consumption from the process-oriented standpoint in LDMD process, which quantified the processing time, power distribution and material consumption of each processing state for every sub-system. In this research, the discontinuous process was divided into effective processing state, rapid moving state and transformed delay state and the processing time of each state were estimated with process parameters. Besides, the operating state time and power distribution of five sub-systems were estimated combining the equipment triggering mechanism and the processing state time.

Through these options, the goal is to reconfigure on-grid wind energy/desalination systems for large- and medium-scale water production. In this context, it is proposed to use lithium-ion batteries for stationary energy storage together with management strategies aimed at avoiding the wind energy/desalination systems having to consume energy from the conventional grid they are connected to. The control strategy is based on ensuring that the power provided by the wind farm and batteries remains in synchrony with the power demand of the desalination plant throughout the system's useful life. The interannual variation of wind energy is considered when sizing the renewable energy system and processes for its estimation are proposed. The case study is centred on the Canary Archipelago, a region that is especially vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, but which enjoys exceptional characteristics for the exploitation of wind energy. The results obtained show the optimal wind farm and energy storage system capacities of the analysed configurations. The approach presented allows a low-carbon operational footprint. If the control strategy were to be put into practice today, the current grid restrictions and a life cycle assessment of the system carried out in a societal context that continues to be fossil fuel dependent indicate a potential reduction of 77.4% of the footprint. However, the remaining 22.6% could be eliminated in the future when the manufacturing processes of wind turbines, batteries and desalination plants receive the benefits of carbon-neutral societies.",,,

In this procedure, the management of polygeneration systems is discussed from various aspects, including climatic change, techno-economic and environmental conditions, layout design, ecological sustainability, and the sociological approach to polygeneration systems in a practical form. As a case study, an innovative biomass-solar-wind polygeneration system to produce power, ammonia, and freshwater for Ahvaz in Iran was designed and evaluated according to the developed procedure. The integration of multi-effect distillation and humidification-dehumidification desalination has been employed for freshwater production. For ammonia production, syngas produced in the gasification unit and nitrogen obtained from the air separation unit were utilized. Power production has been achieved using a combination of the hydrogen-ammonia Brayton cycle, the supercritical carbon dioxide cycle, and the organic Rankine cycle. The designed system was evaluated using energy, exergy, exergoeconomic, exergoenvironmental, emergoeconomic, emergoenvironmental, carbon footprint, and water footprint analyses. The layout design of the proposed system and the sociological study of the system from a systemic approach have enhanced the visibility of its application. Additionally, the investigation of biomass fuel variations and combinations according to climate, along with optimization and dynamic analyses, are key measures that allow for a more comprehensive evaluation of the system from various management perspectives. The results show that the proposed system is capable of producing 523.34 m3/day freshwater, 10.1 MW of power, and storing 17.75 ton/day of ammonia in optimal state.

However, the impact of the health sector’s emissions on human health is not regularly assessed. We aim to estimate the health burden and associated costs of the health sector’s carbon footprint within the European Union (EU). Methods We calculated disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and associated costs based on human health damage factors (DALYs/kg-CO2e) by considering four scenarios. Three scenarios for shared socioeconomic pathways (S1 – high growth, S2 − baseline, and S3 − low growth) represented variations of global society, demographics, and economics until 2100. A fourth scenario (S4) considered the current EU’s 55% reduction goal of greenhouse gas emissions. The healthcare sector’s emissions per capita (in CO2-equivalent) in 2019 were extracted from the Lancet Countdown, and population data were retrieved from Eurostat for the same year. Results In the EU, 365,047 DALYs (95%CI: 194,692–535,403) are expected to be caused by the health sector’s emissions at baseline (S2). In an S1 scenario, the burden would slightly decrease to 316,374 DALYs (95%CI: 170,355–462,393), whereas a S3 scenario would increase 486,730 DALYs (95%CI: 243,365–681,422). If EU’s carbon goals are met, the burden could be substantially reduced to 164,271 DALYs (95%CI: 87,611–240,931). Costs can amount to 25.6 billion euros, when considering DALYs monetisation. Conclusion CO2 emissions from the health sector are expected to significantly impact human health. Therefore, it is important to ensure that EU climate policies for public buildings are in line with the Paris Agreement, increase funding for climate mitigation programs within the healthcare sector, and review clinical practices at the local level.",,,

Within surgery, reducing the number of instruments that are sterilized and disposable supplies that are used for each operation may help achieve both goals. We wanted to measure the existing variability in surgical instrument and supply choices and assess whether standardization could have a meaningful cost and environmental impact. Methods We analyzed surgeon preference cards for common general surgery operations at our hospital to measure the number of sterilizable instrument trays and supplies used by each surgeon for each operation. From this data, we calculated supply costs, carbon footprint, and median operative time and studied the variability in each of these metrics. Results Among the ten operations studied, variability in sterilizable instrument trays requested on surgeon preference cards ranged from one to eight. Variability in disposable supplies requested ranged from 17 to 45. Variability in open supply costs ranged from $104 to $4184. Variability in carbon footprint ranged from 17 to 708 kg CO2e. If the highest-cost surgeon for each operation switched their preference card to that of the median-cost surgeon, $245,343 in open supply costs and 41,708 kg CO2e could be saved. Conclusions There is significant variability in the instrument and supply choices of surgeons performing common general surgery operations. Standardizing this variability may lead to meaningful cost savings and carbon footprint reduction, especially if scaled across the entire health system.",,739,

This study analyzed several sewage indicators, revealing that the majority exceed the national standards of China for direct water discharge. A field experiment was conducted over a period of 4 months to evaluate the effects of different treatments during the natural decomposition of bamboo shoot shells.The treatment groups consisted of the boiled experimental group (EG) and the control group (CG). Results showed that in EG, the methane emission increased by 8.6% (P < 0.05), the carbon dioxide emission increased significantly by 19.7% (P < 0.01), and the nitrous oxide emission decreased by 37.9% (P < 0.01) relative to those in CG. Regression analysis was employed to establish a relationship model between CH4, CO2, and N2O emission fluxes and temperature and humidity in the EG and CG groups. A specific functional relationship was identified between CH4 and CO2 emission fluxes and temperature and humidity, but N2O emission was present. No significant correlation was found between flux and ambient temperature and humidity (R2 < 0.3). We also estimated that the carbon dioxide emissions and water consumption of producing 1 kg of canned bamboo shoots were 2.8669 kg and 86.8 L, covering the processes in the life cycle of bamboo shoot products. This study identifies the potential water pollution problems and provides insights into resource utilization and recycling in bamboo shoot food processing, facilitating the realization of clean production processes. It also sheds light on the water footprint of bamboo shoot products throughout their life cycle, and the carbon footprint research provides valuable references.",,,

Nordic countries are showing high engagement to climate change mitigation while the consumption and lifestyle-based carbon footprints are among the global highest. Majority of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are connected to household consumption where various behavioral changes have been presented in order to reduce the personal carbon footprints. Previous research has shown how behaviors are connected to the living environment and urban structure, which have shown having an impact in forming variations in our lifestyles and behavioral patterns. In this study, with a survey dataset of ∼8000 respondents across the five Nordic countries, the engagement of respondents to different climate and carbon mitigation actions were analyzed and linked to their calculated carbon footprints. Three types of behavioral clusters were found among the respondents, one presenting conscious pro-climate behavior, one relating to frugality behavior, and one cluster related to self-sufficient behavior. The pro-climate behavioral intentions were present more in urbanized areas together with high climate motivation, whereas frugality behavior was level across the urban gradient, and finally respondents from less urbanized areas emphasized self-sufficient behavior. The stated behavioral intentions of the respondents were in contrast to their carbon footprints. Carbon footprints related to leisure consumption were highest in the urban regions and everyday consumption related footprints in the rural regions. Interestingly, only frugality behavior was associated with lower carbon footprints both in everyday and leisure consumption categories, whereas climate conscious behavior was positively related to leisure consumption footprint but negatively related to everyday consumption. The findings emphasize the variation of lifestyles based on different actions in different urban forms where the engagement to climate change mitigation presents differently. The results underline the importance of understanding the role that the built environment plays in being linked to the behavioral patterns and the need to increase the knowledge of the climate impacts of behavioral choices.",,,

Their swift economic expansion and associated activities lead to a rise in carbon footprint. Keeping this in view, unlike previous studies, this study unfolds the asymmetric repercussions of competitive industrial performance and renewable energy within the context of the industrialization era in seven Asian developing countries from 1990 to 2020. The panel NARDL and asymmetric panel causality methodologies have been applied for the purpose of nonlinear analysis. According to the results, the advantageous influence of competitive industrial performance is considerably more pronounced than that of industrialization. The coefficient magnitude associated with the negative shock demonstrates a significantly substantial value in comparison to the positive shock concerning the influence of competitive industrial performance on carbon footprint. Both positive and negative changes in competitive industrial performance mitigate carbon footprint. Renewable energy generates favorable consequences by promoting environmental quality via a reduction in carbon footprint. Across various emerging economies in Asia, the rapid rise of industrialization is linked to the deterioration of environmental quality. Finally, artificial intelligence and natural resource rents decrease carbon footprints while information and communication technology intensifies environmental concerns. The research emphasizes the critical nature of integrating artificial intelligence, robotics, and technological industrial competitiveness in order to adequately tackle the carbon footprint in Asian developing countries.",,,

However, provincial carbon footprints of solar panels based on different production and waste treatment techniques have not been estimated before, including the accumulated and potentially reduced amount of carbon footprints (compared with designed optimal scenarios) in China. This research aims to calculate the total and reduced carbon footprints of solar panels by using the provincial electricity generation data of PVs in China. Results show that the national accumulated carbon emissions of installed panels from 2011 to 2035 would exceed 5 Gt CO2eq by 2060. With advanced production technology and efficient waste treatment, the emissions could be significantly reduced by 50% for the whole lifecycle and 36% for recycling. Although large emission variations existed among provinces, the dominant emission sources shifted from the northwest to eastern regions of China in recent years. Our study provides fundamental guidance to the governmental regulations of waste PVs as well as technological development of recycling treatment scenarios.",,,

We employ a demographically representative online survey among the adult population in Germany which includes a carbon footprint calculator and the randomized information nudges. Results from estimating double-hurdle regression models suggest that the size nudge increases participants' average WTPO by about one third.

We further find that participants' response to the information nudge is primarily effective for younger participants, females, participants with mid-range income, with high levels of education, and with low to medium-sized carbon footprints, ceteris paribus. Further, the WTPO is positively related with income, education, carbon literacy, and environmental preferences. Also, participants tend to underestimate the size of their carbon footprint relative to that of others.

This article connects conspicuous/luxury (C/L) consumption in India to its local, regional and global environmental impacts. We evaluate carbon dioxide (CO2), water, and particulate matter (PM2.5) footprints of consumption disaggregated into food-basic, nonfood-basic, and C/L consumption across expenditure deciles. We find that all three footprints rise, but at different rates, with increasing expenditure. Notably, CO2 and PM2.5 intensities of C/L consumption increase with income, unlike all other intensities of consumption. However, in all three footprints, there is a disproportionate rise in the top decile, which is driven by C/L consumption expenditure more than the pollution intensity of C/L consumption. These results imply that demand reduction measures in C/L consumption could have broad-based and deep environmental benefits, while pollutant-specific mitigation policies may face trade-offs with other environmental impacts. There is a need for further research on connecting local and regional environmental footprints with the actual impacts, to better understand the relationships between conspicuous/luxury consumption and multi-dimensional environmental impacts in developing countries context.",,,

The rice-wheat rotation is one of the main food crop systems in China. However, no comprehensive assessment of the water footprint (WF), carbon footprint (CF), carbon production efficiency (CPE), and net ecosystem economic benefits (NEEB) of different rice-wheat rotation systems has been reported. Objective This study was conducted to assess the productivity, WF, CF, CPE, and NEEB of dry direct-seeded, wet direct-seeded, and transplanted rice-wheat (TR-W) rotation systems. The objective was to provide theoretical guidance for the development of clean and sustainable rice-wheat rotation production technology systems. Methods We used a split-plot design, with the main plots being the dry direct-seeded, wet direct-seeded, and transplanted rice planting methods, and the subplots consisting of two rice genotypes. Dry direct-seeded rice was mainly rainfed, ensuring that the soil remained relatively dry so that the soil is kept aerobic during the whole reproductive period of rice. Wet direct-seeded rice continues to keep the soil moist after sowing; the plots were maintained under a water layer of 3–10 cm following the emergence of 4.5 leaves, a condition that persisted until two weeks prior to the rice harvest. Transplanted rice was maintained under a water layer of 3–10 cm following transplanting until 2 weeks prior to the rice harvest. Subsequent to the rice harvest, the above-ground rice stubble was removed, and the ground was tilled with a rotary tiller in preparation for the subsequent wheat planting. Results Results demonstrated that the annual yield from the dry direct-seeded rice-wheat (DR-W) rotation system was comparable to the wet direct-seeded rice-wheat (WR-W) rotation system, while significantly lower than that of the TR-W rotation system. However, the WF of DR-W rotation system was 45.96% and 33.94% lower than that of WR-W and TR-W rotation systems, respectively, and the CF was 35.57% and 25.87% lower than that of WR-W and TR-W rotation systems, respectively. Therefore, its water and carbon production efficiencies were higher than those of WR-W and TR-W rotation systems. In addition, NEEB in DR-W and TR-W was comparable and significantly higher than that in WR-W. Conclusions The DR-W rotation was a promising rotation system according to the comparable annual yield, lower water and carbon footprints, higher CPE, and comparable or higher NEEB in comparison with other rice-wheat rotation systems. Significance We suggest that the DR-W rotation should be promoted as the primary production mode for the rice-wheat rotation.",,,

This paper presents a carbon footprint assessment, implemented actions for GHG emission reduction, and offers the example of a professional Finnish ice hockey team that achieved carbon neutrality. The study is based on a life cycle assessment method. The Results show that the team's carbon footprint was reduced from 350 tCO2eq by more than 50% between seasons 2018–2019 and 2021–2022 in the assessed categories. The most GHG emission reductions were achieved in the team's and spectators' mobility and ice hall energy consumption. Furthermore, the team compensated for their remaining emissions to achieve carbon neutrality. Multiple possibilities for further GHG emission reductions were recognized. The majority of the GHG emissions were linked to the Scope 3 category, indicating that co-operation with partners and stakeholders was a key to success in attaining carbon neutrality. This paper also discusses the possible limitations and challenges that sport organizations face in assessing climate impacts and reducing GHG emissions, as well as the prospects of overcoming them. Since there are many opportunities for sports to contribute to climate change mitigation, relevant targets and actions to reduce GHG emissions should be integrated into all sport organizations' management.",,,

The present systematic review aimed to review the current literature assessing the carbon footprint of surgical procedures in different surgical fields. Following to the PRISMA statement checklist, three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library) were searched by independent reviewers, who screened records on title and abstract first, and then on the full text. Risk of bias was evaluated using the MINORS system. Over the 878 articles initially identified, 36 original studies were included. They considered ophthalmologic surgical procedures (30.5%), general/digestive surgery (19.4%), gynecologic procedures (13.9%), orthopedic procedures (8.3%), neurosurgery (5.5%), otolaryngology/head and neck surgery (5.5%), plastic/dermatological surgery (5.5%), and cardiac surgery (2.8%). Despite a great methodological heterogeneity, data showed that a single surgical procedure emits 4–814 kgCO2e, with anesthetic gases and energy consumption representing the largest sources of greenhouse gas emission. Minimally invasive surgical techniques may require more resources than conventional open surgery, particularly for packaging and plastics, energy use, and waste production. Each OR has the potential to produce from 0.2 to 4kg of waste per case with substantial differences depending on the type of intervention, hospital setting, and geographic area. Overall, the selected studies were found to be of moderate quality. Based on a qualitative synthesis of the available literature, the OR can be targeted by programs and protocols implemented to reduce the carbon footprint and improve the waste stream of the OR.","2, Supplement",14,Écoresponsabilité en chirurgie

From a global warming perspective, in 2018, Iran was the seventh-highest greenhouse gas emitter in the world. An implementation should demonstrate that it is possible to estimate the environmental impact of climate change. A simple carbon footprint estimation model for waste-to-energy power plants with a life cycle assessment using the 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines is presented in this study. For this purpose, first the system boundary is determined. Then, the total emissions of each part within boundary are identified in terms of total greenhouse gas emission (and expressed in mass of carbon dioxide equivalent). In conclusion, the carbon footprint of generating one kWh of electricity is estimated. The final emission of the Tehran power plant is calculated at 24.46 ktCO2eq/year. Thus, the carbon footprint is estimated to be 1351.94 g CO2eq/kWh. Key parameters that affect carbon footprint are divided into two groups: emission parameters and electricity generation parameters. The sensitivity analysis of effective parameters showed the distance travelled and weight of waste transported during waste transportation, the fossil carbon content in waste composition has the highest effect on carbon footprint. The study shows a 1.2-fold difference between the carbon footprint of two current scenarios of waste treatment: landfill and waste-to-energy plant. The life cycle emissions of landfills exceed of waste-to-energy plants, indicating that these systems can contribute significantly to addressing the current environmental challenges. Additionally, they offer advantages in terms of electricity generation.",,2632,

For this purpose, we use the environmentally extended multiregional input-output model and the Spanish Households Budget Survey to extract expenditure microdata by municipality size. We find that households in smaller municipalities have a larger total carbon footprint due to their higher direct emissions. Although their consumption is lower than other municipalities, they have a more intensive pattern of embedded carbon consumption. Households in smaller municipalities spend a higher share in private transport and housing-related activities, emitting almost an additional ton of direct carbon emissions. Regarding their mitigation potential, results show that for every euro that municipalities with less than 10,000 inhabitants reduce their consumption, they would reduce emissions by 0.796 kgCO2. However, while the size of the municipality increases, the mitigation potential decreases (0.378 kgCO2 for more than 100,000 inhabitants). This highest mitigation potential will only be achieved if mitigation policies especially favor their inhabitants and if infrastructures and social services are developed to facilitate a change in their consumption patterns.",,,

The studies on the carbon footprints of different types of wooden doors are few. In this study, the cradle-to-grave carbon footprints of three types of wooden doors produced in China were comparatively analyzed. Models used for calculating the total life-cycle carbon footprint of a wood-based composite door, a solid wood composite door, and a solid wood door were developed. Considering the biogenic carbon storage and its delayed emissions, the wood-based composite door, solid wood composite door, and solid wood door featured carbon footprints of 0.379, 0.257, and −0.277 kg CO2 e per kg product, respectively. The solid wood door exhibited a negative carbon footprint, indicating that its carbon storage was higher than the carbon emission during the life cycle stage. The raw material acquisition (38%–66%) and the transportation stages (23%–38%) of the three types of wooden doors were the main contributors to the total carbon footprints (excluding the biogenic carbon). The product manufacturing stage released relatively small emissions (11%–24%). The waste disposal treatment at the end-of-life phase, the degradation of wood materials in landfills, and their service life displayed significant impacts on the carbon footprints of the three types of wooden doors. Fiberboard, laminated veneer lumber, sawn lumber, finger-jointed lumber, and electricity were identified as the main emission hotspots. This study provides guidelines for low-carbon development in the wooden door industry.",,,

This study assessed LULCC and its associated carbon footprints in different natural ecosystems. It also established forest reference levels (FRL). We used Landsat images for supervised classification and conducted forest inventories in 186 plots that span moist semi-deciduous forest, swamp forest, gallery forest, woodland and savannah areas. Biomass calculations employed allometric models, biomass expansion factors, and root-to-shoot ratios. Except in Lama Forest Reserve, anthropogenic pressures led to the regressive conversion of natural forest areas to savannah, croplands, and fallows. A progressive trend was observed in semi-deciduous forest (3.18 % per year), resulting in a positive LULC carbon footprint (16.06 tCO2eq.yr−1ha−1). 41.94 % of typical swamp forest was lost, releasing -62.89 tCO2eq.yr−1ha−1. Similarly, woodland decreased by -1.48 and -5.89 % per year, according to considered site, with emissions of -12.16 and -21.83 tCO2eq.yr−1ha−1, respectively.

It has been well understood that economic growth has a significant impact on carbon footprint, but it remains unclear whether this impact will be mitigated or intensified by reducing income inequality. By applying the Multi-Regional Input-Output model, this study assesses the consumption-based carbon footprints of 43 major economies over the period 1995–2019 and conducts the corresponding empirical analysis. Through examining the moderating effect of income inequality (Gini coefficient) on the relationship between economic growth (GDP per capita) and consumption-based carbon footprint (CO2 per capita), we demonstrate that a lower Gini coefficient – a more equitable distribution of income − could significantly promote the decoupling of economic growth from carbon footprint. The results also show a heterogeneous moderating effect of income inequality – reducing income inequality in rich countries helps decouple economic growth from carbon footprint more than in poor countries. This study contributes to a better understanding of the synergy among economic growth (SDG 8), income inequality reduction (SDG 10), and carbon mitigation (SDG 13). Given that reducing income inequality in the context of economic growth can have significant benefits for carbon mitigation, we would suggest that income inequality reduction should be incorporated into climate action, particularly in rich countries.",,,

However, the flooding of lands following the construction of the dam generally leads to an increase in biogenic GHG emissions due to the degradation of biomass found in the newly created reservoir. The life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology is widely used to calculate and compare the carbon footprint of different electricity production pathways, while considering all life cycle stages. Net biogenic GHG emissions from hydropower reservoirs have been poorly considered in LCA because of the scarcity of data. These emissions are complex to quantify as several mechanisms are involved, and extrapolating observations from one reservoir to another is risky as emissions vary greatly depending on different parameters, such as climate, geographic location, age of impoundment, and watershed properties. The objective of this article is to compare different approaches to estimate hydropower reservoir emissions in LCA, to select the most appropriate one, and to apply it to the calculation of the carbon footprint of electricity distributed in the Canadian province of Québec. Net biogenic GHG emissions of all hydropower reservoirs in the province (with 2.5 and 97.5% confidence intervals), as estimated using the G-res model, are 16.5 (14.7–18.6) gCO2∙kWh−1 and 0.29 (0.23–0.35) gCH4∙kWh−1.

The results show that (i) There is a negative relationship between renewable energy consumption and per capita ecological footprint and per capita carbon emissions, indicating that renewable energy consumption alleviates environmental pressure. (ii) When renewable energy consumption increases, the negative effects of renewable energy on per capita ecological footprint and per capita carbon emissions become more significant. This means that the more renewable energy is developed, the more it helps to alleviate environmental pressure.

However, micro carbon element flow analysis is rarely focused considering treatment efficiency of different technology. In this research, a comprehensive carbon footprint analysis is established under the micro carbon element flow analysis and macro carbon footprint analysis based on life cycle assessment (LCA). Three wastewater treatment processes (i.e., anaerobic anoxic oxic, A2O; cyclic activated sludge technology, CAST; modified cyclic activated sludge technology, M-CAST) for low carbon source urban wastewater are selected. The micro key element flow analysis illustrated that carbon source mainly flows to the assimilation function to promote microorganism growth. The carbon footprint analysis illustrated that M-CAST as the optimal wastewater treatment process had the lowest global warming potential (GWP). The key to reduce carbon emissions is to limit electricity consumption in wastewater treatment processes. Under the comprehensive carbon footprint analysis, M-CAST has the lowest environmental impact with low carbon emissions. The sensitivity analysis results revealed that biotreatment section variables considerably reduced the environmental impact on the LCA and the GWP, followed by the sludge disposal section.

Considering annual data from 2000 to 2020, advanced panel data estimation techniques that are robust against data-related problems such as endogeneity, heterogeneous slope coefficients, and dependency among the cross-sectional units are utilized. Overall, the results certify that making productive use of energy reduces consumption-based carbon footprints in E7 countries but not in G7 countries. Besides, improving institutional quality is seen to not only reduce carbon footprints in both samples directly but also indirectly mediate and moderate the energy productivity-carbon footprint nexus in G7 and E7 countries, respectively. Moreover, financial globalization is observed to minimize carbon footprints in G7 countries while boosting them in E7 countries. Contrastingly, financial development is observed to homogeneously boost the carbon footprint levels of both G7 and E7 countries. Lastly, international trade is found not to influence the carbon footprint levels in both samples of countries.

Quantifying the carbon footprint of all the major food categories in different continents is critical for accurately evaluating various aspects of GHG emissions from food production on a continental and global scale. Such information, however, is lacking. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis of plant-based and animal-based food production in all continents comprehensively using 5353 carbon footprint values from 524 published papers and calculated GHG emissions from food production (system boundary is from cradle to farm gate) at the continental and global scale. Our results indicate that the average carbon footprint of plant-based foods amounts to 0.66 kg CO2-eq kg−1, which is only 10.7% of animal-based foods (6.15 kg CO2-eq kg−1). The carbon footprint of plant-based food in Asia and Europe is 8.9%–184% higher than that of other continents. Africa has the lowest carbon footprint for plant-based foods, owing to its low agricultural input and limited crop management. However, the carbon footprint of animal-based foods in Africa and Asia is 2.5%–150% higher than that of other continents, with North America and Oceania recording the lowest. Total annual GHG emission from global food production reached 8125 Mt CO2-eq, with grains, meat, and milk together accounting for 70.8%. Asia, owing to its large production, emerged as the largest emitter, accounting for 55.4% of global GHG emissions. It was followed by Europe (16.3%) and North America (10.5%), while Africa, South America and Oceania together emit 17.8%.

Bananas are of great economic importance in tropical regions, and their production is characterized by high consumption of natural resources, increasing greenhouse gas emissions and environmental impacts. This study aimed to identify critical points in banana production, understand how they influence future footprints, and develop strategies to reduce current footprints. Life cycle assessment was used to estimate water scarcity (ISO 14046) and carbon (ISO 14067) footprints. Results are presented per 1 kg of banana. Primary data from 10-year averages were collected from farms located in the Lower Jaguaribe sub-basin. The results revealed that the carbon footprint ranged from 0.21 to 0.84 kg CO2 eq kg−1 in 2023, whereas the water scarcity footprint reached 1441 m3 eq kg−1. Under the current scenario, yield improvement could reduce carbon footprint by up to 57.9%, and greater efficiency in water use could decrease water footprint by up to 77%. In 2055, projections suggest that improvements in irrigation could lead to reductions of 5% in carbon footprint and 24.9% in water scarcity footprint. The findings of this study highlight the importance of adopting a sustainable approach to banana production, emphasizing the need to improve natural resource management and promote conscious agricultural practices, such as no-till farming and polyculture, which favor carbon sequestration. The use of plants that perform biological nitrogen fixation can reduce the need for nitrogen fertilizers, in alignment with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

Attention should therefore be paid to the entire life-cycle energy and carbon footprints of LLM-powered intelligent chatbots in both the present and future in order to mitigate their climate change impact. In this work, we clarify and highlight the energy consumption and carbon emission implications of eight main phases throughout the life cycle of the development of such intelligent chatbots. Based on a life-cycle and interaction analysis of these phases, we propose a system-level solution with three strategic pathways to optimize the management of this industry and mitigate the related footprints. While anticipating the enormous potential of this advanced technology and its products, we make an appeal for a rethinking of the mitigation pathways and strategies of the life-cycle energy usage and carbon emissions of the LLM-powered intelligent chatbot industry and a reshaping of their energy and environmental implications at this early stage of development.",,,

However, research integrating life cycle and energy analysis is missing to inform decision-makers. Method Consequently, the paper presents models combining a model-based life cycle assessment (MBLCA) and ship energy simulations to examine the footprints of a generic New Panamax Containership (DTC). Analyses were conducted to assess the energy and carbon effects of using synthetic methanol as marine fuel. Results The life-cycle analysis confirms the overwhelming prevalence of operations in the total greenhouse gases emission during the ship's lifetime. The analysis highlights the potential of carbon savings if the vessel consumes methanol produced from neutral energy and renewable carbon sources. However, the magnitude of shipping fuel requirements may profoundly impact energy infrastructures while still requiring large volumes of carbon offset credits. Conclusion The paper confirms the usefulness of integrating life-cycle analysis and energy modelling to discuss future energy scenarios. The completeness of the models also allows for future research analysing other energy solutions.",,,

However, the features, changing trends, and determinants of the carbon footprint flow embodied in global population migration are poorly understood. This study employed social network analysis and the exponential random graph model (ERGM) to investigate the structural changes and drivers of the carbon footprint network embodied in global migration from 1995 to 2015. The results showed that approximately 50% of carbon footprint flow embodied in international migration flowed from developing to developed countries. The spatial connections between countries in the network were becoming increasingly close, displaying a typical small-world structure, and showing low reciprocity and negative assortativity. Moreover, centrality analysis highlighted the United States and the European Union as being at the core of the network, whereas some emerging economies (e.g., China, India, and South Africa) were shown as having an increasing influence on the network. The determinants of network formation were divided into three effects. For node attribute effect, countries with developed economy, high proportion of industrial value added, urbanization and openness were becoming the destinations of carbon inflows from immigrants, while countries with high consumption of renewable energy and energy intensity had a trend of carbon outflows with emigrants over periods. As for exogenous network effect, the significance of economic integration on the formation of the network was strengthening, while that of geographical proximity and cultural similarity was declining. Additionally, the positive impact of self-organizational effect on the network was decreasing. This study provided guidance for countries to formulate policies to reduce the carbon emissions embodied in international migration.",,,

However, the lifecycle carbon intensity of electrochemical batteries is uncertain throughout lifecycle battery-related activities. In this study, a generic methodology is proposed to accurately quantify the lifecycle carbon intensity of electrochemical batteries. A cross-scale multi-stage analytic platform with inter-disciplinary and trans-disciplinary is formulated, involving battery materials (anode, cathode, electrolyte), charging/discharging behaviours, cascade battery utilization, recycling, and reproduction. A case study on a zero-energy district in subtropical Guangzhou indicates that lifetime EV battery carbon intensity is +556 kg CO2,eq/kWh for the scenario with pure fossil fuel-based grid reliance, while the minimum carbon intensity of EVs at −860 kg CO2,eq/kWh can be achieved for the solar-wind supported scenario. The grid mandatory EVs charging will slightly increase the battery carbon intensity to −617.2 kg CO2,eq/kWh, and the exclusion of embodied carbon on both solar PV and wind turbines will increase the battery carbon intensity to −583.8 kg CO2,eq/kWh.

However, RALBP considering carbon footprint, which is a very significant environmental concern, has scarcely been studied in the literature and a practical “cross-station” design is never mathematically formulated. In this paper, a mixed-integer programming model is proposed to optimize the two objectives according to the Pareto principle. A particle swarm algorithm (PSO) with some improvement rules is designed to solve the problem. To examine the efficiency of the algorithm, computational experiments including five medium-sized and five large-sized datasets are conducted. The results show that the efficiency of PSO is better than that of four other classic algorithms in terms of three evaluation metrics.

Indeed, the country has realized that it is time to monitor its environmental indicators such as energy consumption, accounting, and carbon footprint to comply with global efforts to reduce carbon footprint and aim for energy efficiency while preserving and optimizing its energy resources. Much attention has been focused on the transportation sector, the second-largest global polluter, which will be the subject of our analysis. Our case study will focus on the evaluation of three vehicles to examine the influence of driver behavior on energy consumption and carbon footprint. Data collection was carried out using UPLOGISTIX, a solution developed by our hosting entity, which aims to present calculations of environmental measures to display the results and ultimately provide recommendations for reducing its carbon footprint. An approach has been proposed to achieve the set objectives. The results of our analysis highlight the existence of a significant relationship between behavioral barriers and energy consumption. Indeed, the behavior of a reckless driver, characterized by abrupt braking, rapid accelerations, and other factors, leads to an actual energy consumption that exceeds recommended standards.

To address this, efficient energy utilization in existing industries is crucial. Energy audits identify energy losses and recommend saving measures. Therefore, this study evaluates energy efficiency through an audit and estimates greenhouse gas emissions for a Meta Abo brewery. The indirect method of energy audit and the greenhouse gas protocol of carbon footprint estimation were used to evaluate the energy efficiency and carbon emissions of Meta Abo brewery. The boiler efficiency for Bono Energia and Cochran boilers was found to be 79.2% and 80.9%, respectively. Poor insulation caused an estimated annual fuel loss of 35,350 l (638,768 Ethiopian birr) for steam pipes, while steam leakage resulted in a loss of 31,614 l (571,265 Ethiopian birr). The factory's high electricity expense was attributed to a diesel generator consuming 6000 l/d. Greenhouse gas emissions raised from 9156 to 22,697 tons of CO2 equivalent between 2014 and 2018. Implementing the proposed energy-saving measures could save 20.4 TJ of thermal and electrical energy annually, costing approximately 8.5 million Ethiopian birr, and reduce boiler emissions by 455 tons of CO2 equivalent.

With the rapidly increasing demand for food and high carbon mitigation pressure, food consumption in rural China has emerged as a pivotal factor in the transition process. Although diet-related carbon footprint (DCF) has been widely discussed worldwide, little is known about intra-group differences in DCFs, particularly in rural regions. Additionally, a sustainable transition pathway is unclear because of the trade-offs between DCF, nutritional quality, and affordability. In this study, inequality in intra-rural food consumption and the associated carbon footprints of different food categories were revealed based on the latest and most updated social household survey data. Future transition pathways encompassing DCFs, affordability, and nutrition were comprehensively considered. The results revealed stark intragroup differences in the DCF of rural residents, and the consumption of animal-based food exhibited a more pronounced level of inequality than plant-based food. Compared with other groups, high-income households had a higher per capita DCF, larger emission share from animal-based food, and lower share from plant-based food. Based on future sustainable transition analysis, fully adopting optimized dietary patterns can reduce the DCF by 2.28–48.84% and improve nutritional quality, especially in low-income populations (16.98–38.62%). However, regardless of the transition pathway, affordability for low-income groups needs to be considered, which may hinder sustainable transitions in the future.

However, this industry is frequently linked to environmental issues, particularly its potential emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs). This study attempts to estimate the carbon footprint of a palm oil company's operation for the year of 2030. In doing so, a novel methodology that consists of organizational lifecycle assessment (O-LCA), simple linear regression (SLR), and double exponential smoothing (DES) methods is proposed. O-LCA is used to identify the sources of emission and estimate the amount of the emission generated, while SLR and DES are used to forecast the sources. As the result, the carbon footprint in 2030 is estimated to be 62,758,433.56 kg Carbon Dioxide equivalent (CO2eq) where on average a ton of crude palm oil (CPO) produces 1.08 ton CO2eq. The study also discloses that the three largest emission sources are palm oil mill effluent (POME), fertilizer, and transportation. The forecasting methods used are quite accurate with mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of less than 10%. The results of this study can shed a light to help Indonesia achieving its target to reduce GHG emission by 2030.",,,

In the EC system, there is a varying flux footprint climatology which causes a spatial mismatch between the forcing data from the ET model and EC observations, generating extra errors in estimating ET. This study endeavored to reduce the error caused by the spatial scale inconsistency between forcing data and ET measurements employing joint observations from EC system, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and satellites under the flux footprint theory and the Penman-Monteith (P-M) model. The joint observations were performed in 2020 at the LuanCheng (LES) and YuCheng (YES) sites. Surface conductance for the varying flux footprint climatology was retrieved from EC observations using the inverted P-M model. The vegetation indices from various remote sensing platforms, including UAV, MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2, were retrieved and employed to evaluate surface conductance and ET within the flux footprint climatology. The findings indicated that varying flux footprint climatology had a significant impact on the accuracy of ET estimation. The UAV, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2 data all generated good ET estimations (LES: R2 > 0.72, RMSE < 0.81 mm day−1; YES: R2 > 0.74, RMSE < 0.91 mm day−1) in the 80 % and 90 % flux footprint climatology.

However, the contribution of conservation and regenerative farming practices, including cover cropping, on energy and C footprints have not yet been documented for cropping systems in arid and semi-arid regions. This study evaluated the energy and C footprint of cover crop integrated silage maize (Zea mays L.) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) production systems in the semi-arid region of the southwestern US. The treatments were mixtures of winter cover crops: i) grasses and legumes (GL), ii) grasses, brassicas, and legumes (GBL), iii) grasses and brassicas (GB), and iv) no cover crops (NCC) control for each crop production system. Results showed cover crops had 24.1–24.5% greater energy input than NCC. In silage maize rotation, energy output was 17–22% greater in GBL and GL than in NCC. In silage sorghum rotation, the energy output was 15–24% greater in all cover crops than in NCC. The resulting net energy was 16–21% greater in GBL and GL than in NCC under silage maize, while it was 18–24% greater in GBL and GB than in NCC under silage sorghum. In the silage maize system, the C-footprint per kg yield was not different among treatments, whereas in silage sorghum, it was 58% greater in GBL than in NCC. The benefit-to-cost ratio was greater than one for all treatments, but the additional revenue through C credit programs could make cover cropping a more feasible and beneficial approach, improving economic and environmental sustainability while producing silage crops. While the C footprint was crop rotation specific, cover cropping should be encouraged over crop-fallow systems to producers in semi-arid environments to reduce energy usage and increase C-credit benefits. Clear national and state policy on the C credit program will also enhance economic and environmental benefits by adopting cover cropping and other regenerative farming practices.",6,,

However, there is a lack of a comprehensive accounting approach tailored to the construction features of prefabricated buildings. To address this issue, this study develops a framework to account the life-cycle carbon footprint of prefabricated buildings within the circular economy principles. The developed framework is applied to a prefabricated building in Chengdu, China, revealing that a significant carbon footprint is attributed to the material production and transportation stages. Moreover, an uncertainty analysis is conducted based on Data Quality Indicator evaluation method and Monte Carlo Simulation to validate the accounting framework, and a minor deviation of 0.085 % between the uncertain and calculated values validates the proposed accounting framework. Furthermore, key processes to mitigate the carbon footprint are identified. The results show that cast-in-place concrete is a key process at the construction materials level. Building upon these findings, this study offers recommendations on accurately and efficiently accounting the carbon footprint of prefabricated buildings. The research findings contribute to fostering the accounting of the life-cycle carbon footprint for prefabricated buildings, establishing a theoretical and empirical basis for circular economy implementation in prefabricated buildings, and offering insights for making informed carbon emission reduction decisions in prefabricated buildings.",,,

Additionally, individual citizens struggle to connect with community targets. This study addresses these issues by computing a comprehensive carbon footprint pathway that, as a main contribution, can be easily personalized and associated with common carbon footprint calculators. This approach innovatively leverages inverted “S-shaped” patterns based on logistic functions that, unlike common linear patterns, have been documented as relevant for diffusion mechanisms of social or ecological transformations. One challenge lies in efficiently aligning the carbon footprint figures, expressed in CO2eq, with IPCC's +2 °C carbon budgets, expressed in CO2-only. This work first retrieves the current share of CO2-only footprint and then defines two mitigation pathways: one focusing solely on CO2 emissions and one addressing residual GHGs. Except for initial and final emission levels, both targeted pathways are defined by the same logistic function, based on the assumed intrinsic link between CO2 and the other GHGs. As final targets, the CO2-only pathway considers the common net-zero emission goal while the second pathway considers a level of 1 tCO2eq/year per capita of unmitigated non-CO2 emissions, in alignment with IPCC's latest assumptions and anticipated population growth. Besides the new +2 °C compatible suggested pathways, developing this method for France and Wallonia has also revealed that they should reach territorial (nature-based) carbon uptake of at least three times their current levels, necessitating deep land-use changes in their policies (implementing intensive urban vegetation, alternative agriculture techniques, etc).",,,

The study found that a 1% increase in CFBL is associated with a 0.15% increase in ecological footprint, whereas a 1% increase in TFFS is correlated with a 0.80% increase in ecological footprint. This suggests that fossil fuel subsidies have a larger detrimental impact on the ecological footprint compared to CFBL. The results provide evidence of an asymmetric relationship between CFBL, TFFS, and ecological footprints. Specifically, CFBL has a significant positive association with ecological footprint, with a 1% increase in CFBL associated with a 0.01% increase in ecological footprint, while a 1% decrease in CFBL results in a 0.002% increase in ecological footprint. TFFS has a more pronounced impact on ecological footprint, with a 1% increase associated with a 0.14% decrease and a 1% decrease associated with a 0.30% decrease, which is twice as large. The findings suggest that positive shocks in environmental taxation lead to a 0.54% decrease in ecological footprints, while negative shocks have a profoundly detrimental effect with a 1.33% increase in ecological footprints. Additionally, the interaction effect indicates that the effectiveness of CFBL and TFFS on ecological footprints is contingent on the level of environmental tax. The result shows that with a 1% increase in environmental tax, the negative impact of CFBL and TFFS on ecological footprints decreases by 0.02% and 0.09%, respectively. These findings underscore the importance of reducing carbon emissions and fossil fuel subsidies and implementing effective environmental taxation policies to promote sustainability and mitigate environmental damage.",,,

A prerequisite for managing and controlling the carbon footprint is calculating and visualizing it transparently. In this work, a general framework for live estimating the carbon footprint for production processes is presented. The framework is used to investigate the carbon footprint of additively manufactured components. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in the straightforwardness of the general framework with a holistic data model. With this it is possible to compare different Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) methods and assumptions of new additively manufactured parts, as all data and methods are integrated from data acquisition at the machine to balancing compactly. A demonstrator is developed that calculates the consumption of energy and materials in real-time. The demonstrator consists of a AM machine, sensors for measuring all consumption, data processing in the back end, and a user-friendly dashboard in the front end. Due to different assumptions and calculation methods, there is a high variation in the final result of the carbon footprint calculation, which is presented in this paper.",,647,30th CIRP Life Cycle Engineering Conference

China is the leading source of carbon emissions related to consumption and has become the focal point of worldwide efforts to lower carbon emissions. Using applications that monitor individual consumption and offer emissions reports will aid consumers in effectively controlling and mitigating their carbon footprint. There is a dearth of consumer understanding regarding the consequences of their everyday consumption-related carbon emissions. This paper uses Shanghai as the study area to assess the variables that encourage consumers to use carbon footprint monitoring applications in China. The integrated technology acceptance model (TAM) and theory of planned behaviour (TPB) were expanded to include personal innovativeness and incentive policies to achieve this aim. In total, 571 responses to legitimate questionnaires were collected. An empirical assessment was conducted using a structural equation modeling to examine the variables impacting consumers' usage of carbon footprint monitoring applications. The results suggest that personal innovativeness, incentive policies, attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease-of-use influence consumers' usage of carbon footprint monitoring applications positively and significantly. The research outcomes provide complete insight into consumer behaviour concerning adopting carbon footprint tracking apps. Besides, the study offers policy implications for decision-makers and potential stakeholders.",,,

The secondary objective was to assess the effectiveness of the following measures in reducing the carbon footprint associated with this technique: outpatient treatment, arthroscopic water filtration, surgery under locoregional anesthesia. Hypothesis The hypothesis was that the carbon footprint could be significantly improved with the implementation of these three procedures. Methods A continuous series of 26 patients who underwent surgery for a rotator cuff tear involving only one tendon between November 2020 and April 2021 were included. The evaluation protocol consisted of three parts: 1/ use of volatile anesthetic agents; 2/ electrical consumption linked to the procedure; 3/ emissions related to patient and staff travel, delivery of implants and waste management. Another series of 26 patients operated between November 2018 and April 2019 who had none of these three factors were matched. Results The carbon impact of arthroscopic repair of the rotator cuff was estimated at 334.61±18.82kgCO2eq. The implementation of the three methods for improvement made it possible to significantly reduce emissions by 40.9±1.71kgCO2eq (12.2%) (p<0.001). Conclusion Performing surgery under locoregional anesthesia, on an outpatient basis with water purification, reduces the carbon impact of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair by more than 12%.

This fact is fundamental for the correct planning and evaluation of fiscal policies based on income taxation to reduce the carbon footprint. Our results confirm that the OLS estimation would overestimate the effects of income on CO2 reduction by 26%.",6,,

Therefore, in this study, we consider Japan as a case study and apply an environmentally extended input-output table to tackle its embodied carbon footprint across sectors and regions. To further investigate the contribution of food transport, we extracted transport-related carbon footprints embodied in Japanese food consumption according to six transport types. The results indicate that 34% of the carbon footprints from Japan's food consumption were induced overseas, mostly being leaked in some Asian and Pacific countries (4536 kilo tonCO2eq in China and 4758 kilo tonCO2eq in other Asian and Pacific countries’ group) and the United States (4444 kilo tonCO2eq). The implications of this study reveal the key role of food consumption in Japan's future decarbonization and carbon neutrality, and provide potential mitigation measures to reduce transport emissions from the perspective of food supply chain.",,65,

In this context, different philosophies exist. A classic debate, referred to as “boomsters vs. doomsters”, asks whether humanity's drive for technological innovations will mitigate climate change, or whether it is justifiable to compromise our living standards, affluence, and consumption patterns. A Danish research project has elucidated this topic through cross-collaboration between historians and engineers by quantifying the personal consumption-based carbon footprint (CF) of Danish citizens, taking into account the consumption segments of food, transport, housing, and furniture. Quantification is conducted through life-cycle assessments (LCA) of five decadal timesteps during the period 1860–2020. As only one other study conducting historical (retrospective) LCA with an extensive time horizon was identified in the scientific literature, our own study provides novel insights by exploring possible approaches in this field. Historical LCA has many similarities with prospective (future) LCA, providing inspiration to the approach. The main challenge of the study is to adjust both foreground and background systems in the inventory modelling phase. Data is largely based on national statistics, books, museum case studies, expert testimonials, and proxies such as using the steam turbine as an indicator of improvements to technological efficiency over time. The results show a slightly declining carbon footprint in the period 1860–1930, from 7.7 to 6.6 t CO2-eq per capita annually. Unsurprisingly the footprint peak is not found until the 1970s, at 11 t, reducing to 5.4 t in the 2010s. The residential energy consumption segment contributes half of this CF, followed by transportation by road and rail. Discussion of the results shows that whether technology can mitigate the impact from the increase in affluence depends on the specific consumption segment. For housing combined with residential energy, the results show that technology can mitigate increases in CF, despite the comforts of home having only increased over time. For the transportation segment, however, the past century has seen an eightfold increase in CF due to the pronounced evolution of personal modes of transportation. The findings suggests that the “boomsters vs. doomsters” debate is not so black and white after all. We further suggest that historical LCA, in tandem with prospective LCA, can provide valuable insights for decision support to facilitate a green transition and hence a green future.",,599,

Thus, a dynamic life cycle assessment (LCA) model was developed to assess the accumulated PV panels with a heterogeneous carbon footprint if manufactured and installed in the United States. The state-level carbon footprint of solar electricity (CFEPV-avg) from 2022 to 2050 was estimated using several cradle-to-gate production scenarios to account for emissions stemming from electricity generated from solar PVs. The CFEPV-avg (min 0.032, max 0.051, weighted avg. 0.040 kg CO2-eq/kWh) in 2050 will be significantly lower than that of the comparison benchmark (min 0.047, max 0.068, weighted avg. 0.056 kg CO2-eq/kWh).

The field experiment was comprising four N fertilizer regimes such as i) single inorganic fertilizer with 800 kg N ha−1 (N800); ii) single inorganic fertilizer with 400 kg N ha−1 (N400); iii) inorganic and organic fertilizers each with 200 kg N ha−1 (N200+O200) as well as without N fertilizer treatment as control (CK). Data regarding the soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrate N (NO3−–N), ammonium N (NH4+–N) and emissions of carbon oxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were measured. Organic fertilizer substitution (OFS) boosted SOC while decreased NO3−–N and NH4+–N concentrations. The cumulative CO2 emissions and emission factors (EFs) of N2O did not change significantly amongst fertilization strategies; however, as compared to N800, N400 and N200+O200 significantly reduced N2O emissions by 41.8%–45.7% and 43.5%–46.6% respectively. The NF was dominated by N residues (73.0%–97.4%) and organic fertilizer (24.37%), with a significant difference detected between N400 and N200+N200 treatments. Meanwhile, compared to inorganic plots, OFS significantly reduced CF (345.9%–368.0%), which was influenced by SOC sequestration. The CF from N plots in apple orchard was dominated by fertilizer (21.7%–39.6%), pesticides (4.3%–6.2%) and N2O (5.6%–11.8%). In addition, our results were further supported by a meta-analysis with 22 published studies, which showed that organic fertilizer and chemical fertilizer + organic fertilizer significantly reduced regional CF by 388.8% and 78.2%, respectively. However, regional NF ranged from 441.4 kg N-eq ha−1 to 453.9 kg N-eq ha−1, with no significant difference between fertilizer strategies. Therefore, reducing the amount of N fertilizer and partial OFS is a viable long-term strategy for mitigating climate change through C sequestration, reduction of N residues, and GHG mitigation, which could be beneficial to low C apple production in the Loess Plateau, China.",,,

Sensitivity analysis results show that EROI has the largest variation range and change in rail transportation distance of coal leads to maximum variation in life cycle energy input, EROI and life cycle GHG emissions. Comparison of the three CCS technologies clearly shows that the integrated system using calcium looping has the lowest increase in life cycle energy input and life cycle blue water consumption and the lowest decrease in EROI. Thus, in addition to efficiently reducing CO2 emissions and enhancing power generation capacity of existing coal powerplants, use of calcium looping is also favourable from a life cycle sustainability perspective.",,,

I compile published estimates of the elasticities of the carbon footprint or energy requirements, and compute new estimates. This amounts to around 80 estimates (one-third of which are newly computed) for over 20 countries. It is found that, generally, the carbon footprint grows less rapidly than expenditure, and confirms that the income elasticity is lower than the expenditure elasticity. Unambiguously, the assumption of an income elasticity equal to unity is not supported by the published literature. I discuss the difference between carbon inequality and carbon concentration, the ambiguity in the literature between income elasticity and expenditure elasticity.

Five treatments were involved: synthetic nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizer (NPK) and 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of manure replacing synthetic N (25%M, 50%M, 75%M, and 100%M). Compared with NPK treatment, 25%M and 50%M treatments maintained annual yield (winter wheat plus summer maize) and sustainable yield index (SYI), but 75%M and 100%M treatments significantly decreased annual yield, and 100%M treatment also significantly reduced annual SYI. The SOC content exhibited a significant increasing trend over years in all treatments. After 7 years, SOC storage in manure treatments increased by 3.06–11.82 Mg ha−1 relative to NPK treatment. Manure treatments reduced annual GHG emissions by 14%–60% over NPK treatment. The CF of the cropping system ranged from 0.16 to 0.39 kg CO2 eq kg−1 of grain without considering SOC sequestration, in which the CF of manure treatments lowered by 18%–58% relative to NPK treatment. When SOC sequestration was involved in, the CF varied from −0.39 to 0.37 kg CO2 eq kg−1 of grain, manure treatments significantly reduced the CF by 22%–208% over NPK treatment. It was concluded that replacing 50% of synthetic fertilizer with manure was a sound option for achieving high crop yield and SYI but low CF under the tested cropping system.",,,

The results showed that the informal sector in several industries contributed significantly to the carbon footprint of the top three supply chains with larger CO2 emissions in India.

While originally developed through a nutritional lens, food security is also increasingly incorporating the environmental quality of diets. This study develops a Structural Equation Model to examine how consumers concerns over food insecurity – in terms of its impact on health and poverty – and environmental beliefs influence the carbon footprint of diets. Using data from a survey representative of the Italian population, this study shows that health-related food insecurity concerns increase the use of health motives when shopping for food, in turn reducing the carbon footprint of the diet. Conversely, poverty-related food insecurity concerns are associated to diets higher in carbon footprint, as they reduce health motives, and increase private shopping motives (e.g., taste, low price). Overall, the study highlights how shifts to more sustainable food systems require a better understanding of what motivate consumers to make more sustainable food choices.",,465,

Although the carbon emissions of bast fiber textiles have been studied using life cycle assessment method, there is a lack of comprehensive literature analyzing and summarizing the results. This study reviews the current state of research on the carbon emissions of bast fiber textiles. Compared to other plant fibers, there are fewer studies on the carbon footprint or life cycle assessment of bast fiber textiles, and these studies lack a comprehensive “cradle to grave” or “gate to grave” analysis. In addition, inconsistencies exist in the allocation methods used for carbon footprint assessments. This study suggests a combination of physical and economic allocation to conduct a more accurate environmental impact assessment of bast fiber textiles. On the basis of the above review, this study modularizes the process of the entire life cycle of textiles and analyzes the carbon sequestration and emission characteristics to determine the main considerations for carbon footprint assessment. The carbon sequestration effect of bast fiber textiles should be analyzed at the raw material extraction stage and at the end-of-life stage. Oxygen release and consumption are also considered as additional factors to be quantified and analyzed in this study. In the future, the modular method should be used for all carbon footprint evaluation reports for bast fiber textiles. This method helps to comprehensively quantify and evaluate the carbon footprint of bast fiber textiles throughout their entire life cycle. It can provide recommendations for green design, green production and sustainable consumption.",,,

In top-down-estimates, when microdata are lacking, it is also used to estimate the inequality in emissions between households across the income or expenditure distribution. In this article, we point to several key methodological considerations when computing the elasticity of household CFs, and demonstrate their practical and empirical implications by making use of Belgian survey data. We find that the choice between income and expenditure as the main variable is most consequential for the estimated elasticity of household CFs, while the income elasticity of household emissions is more sensitive to a broader range of methodological choices. This has implications for top-down estimates of emissions along the income distribution, and related indicators of the inequality in household emissions by income groups.",,,

To feed the ever-growing population, there is a need to identify agricultural management practices to increase food production while reducing GHG emissions for climate change mitigation and adaptation. This study aimed to estimate the GHG balance at the farm scale and identify environmental hotspots and mitigation opportunities among smallholder sorghum farms in Western Kenya. The study hypothesized that different intensification levels influenced the GHG balance. The study collected data from 300 smallholder farms in western Kenya. The principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis were used for farm typologies construction. Five farm types were constructed that ranged from no or minimal external inputs and highly intensified, small to large, and low to highly endowed in tropical livestock units. The Cool Farm Tool Excel program model was used to estimate GHG balances. that the sorghum cropping systems were net sinks of soil GHGs. The GHG balance, carbon footprint, and monetary footprint significantly varied across the farm types at p = 0.025, p = 0.018, and p = 0.004, respectively. The GHG balance ranged from – 818.76 kg CO2 eq. ha−1 in manure-intensive and low fertilizer-intensity small farms to 174.29 kg CO2 eq. ha−1 in fertilizer-intensive and moderate manure application rates on small farms. Fertilizer production and direct and indirect emissions (fertilizer application) were the environmental hotspots accounting for 63 and 30 % of the GHG emissions.

However, the impacts of crop diversification on crop production and environmental benefits are still poorly understood. In this study, conducted at two sites in the Yellow River Delta, China, we investigated the effects of legume intercropping, specifically maize/soybean (M/S) and maize/peanut (M/P) systems, on crop productivity, economic return, ecosystem economic budget (NEEB), CF, and carbon sustainability index (CSI) in comparison to conventional monocrops. Crops were grown in replicated field plots and fertilized in their strips according to common practice for monocrops. Compared to the expected averages of monocrops, maize/legume intercropping demonstrated higher crop yields, with M/S achieving a 37% and 43% increase at the two sites, respectively, and M/P achieving an 11% and 20% increase. The higher overyielding in M/S was attributed to stronger selection effects, i.e., interspecific facilitation. However, the complementarity effects induced by the competitive dominance of maize were similar in both intercropping systems. Additionally, M/S exhibited greater potential for improving net revenues compared to M/P. Life cycle assessments revealed lower CFs in the intercropping systems compared to monocultures. M/S reduced CFs per unit of area by 26.8% at both sites, CFs per unit of maize equivalent energy yield by 25% and 33%, and CFs per unit of revenue by 20% and 25% at the two sites, respectively. M/P also resulted in reduced CFs, albeit to a lesser extent. Intercropping enhanced the CSI, with the highest values observed in the M/S system. However, both intercropping systems showed limited effects on soil C sequestration. Overall, our results highlight that maize/legume intercropping is a feasible approach to enhance crop productivity while reducing CFs. The M/S system outperformed the M/P system in terms of crop yields, economic benefits, and CF reduction. However, the intercropping systems showed limited effects on SOC storage.

Identification of rice cropping systems with lower GHG emissions and higher grain yields is of great significance to ensure food security while minimizing agricultural carbon footprint (CF). Objective This study aimed to identify the optimal rice-based cropping system with lower greenhouse effects and comparable annual yield in central China. Methods Used life cycle assessment, a two-year field experiment was performed to evaluate the direct and indirect GHG emissions, CF, and carbon sequestration capacity in the six rice-based cropping systems widely used in central China, which consisted of fallow-early rice-late rice, rapeseed-early rice-late rice, fallow-ratoon rice, rapeseed-ratoon rice (RRaR), fallow-middle rice, and rapeseed-middle rice. Results The results showed that compared with the three systems with fallow season, the three systems with rapeseed had lower annual CH4 emissions. The two systems with ratoon rice had lower annual indirect and direct GHG emissions than the two systems with double rice. The three systems with rapeseed had higher annual biomass, grain yields, and fixed carbon in biomass and significantly lower CF than the three systems with fallow season, and RRaR had the highest value of fixed carbon in biomass. The systems with ratoon rice had lower average CF than those systems with double rice. CH4 emissions from paddy fields were the primary source of total annual GHG and the main component of CF. Compared with the three systems with fallow season, the three systems with rapeseed had significantly higher annual carbon sequestration capacity based on net ecosystem production (NEP). Ratoon rice systems had higher average NEP than double- and middle-rice systems. RRaR had the lowest CF per unit yield and highest NEP among all the six systems. Conclusions The results indicated that appropriate rice-based cropping systems may alleviate the greenhouse effect via reducing GHG emissions and enhancing paddy NEP, RRaR could achieve relatively higher annual grain yield and carbon sequestration capacity as well as lower CF. Significance This study highlight conversion of double rice and middle rice systems to RRaR may help improve grain yield and mitigate greenhouse effect. The findings may provide a theoretical basis for selection of sustainable development of rice based cropping systems in central China.",,,

To better understand the climate implications of soybean production, this study assessed and compared the carbon footprint in the Paraná State, Brazil, during the 2020|21 super harvest and the 2021|22 rainfall scarcity. The method of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and the cradle-to-gate perspective were applied using the ImpactWorld+ for Continental Latin America v.1.251 method to calculate the climate change impacts. The uncertainties of short and long-term climate impacts were calculated by the Monte Carlo simulation. The results showed that the carbon footprint of the 2021|22 harvest was 267% greater than that of the 2020|21 harvest, while the 2020|21 production was 86% greater than that of 2021|22. The reduction in productivity observed in 2021|22 soybean crop contributed the most to the long-term climate impacts and impacts on ecosystems and human health.

Many methods exist to estimate ecological metrics, such as the Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) in the individual product development phases with stand-alone software. However, methods to integrate the PCF in the entire process chain with the possibility to interact in the process are missing. This paper presents a new approach to measuring the ecological impact of an Additive Manufacturing production process, exemplified by the Material Extrusion (MEX) process. The novelty of the approach lies in implementing a single software for machine control, processing, and visualization of sensor signals, parameter variation, and reporting functions to enable comprehensive PCF management. The workflow includes a model-based prediction of the PCF based on the G-code, live monitoring during the production phase, and a subsequent automated evaluation at a central interface. Critical points can be identified, and approaches for optimizing the MEX process can be designed. Uncertainty evaluation of the PCF based on the combination of uncertainty of the sensors and the Life Cycle Assessment is included in the method. The developed prototype software can be used in the design phase for prediction and in the process phase for optimization, enabling seamless PCF management for the MEX process.",,36,31st CIRP Conference on Life Cycle Engineering

Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the effect of different Global Warming Potential (GWP) metrics, carbon sequestration by trees on farms and different allocation methods at the processing stage. The carbon footprint for the cradle-to-farm gate represented 90–95% of the cradle-to-grave for both beef and sheep. At the farm gate (not accounting for the sensitivity analysis studied), the beef results were influenced by the contribution of dairy beef, which showed a 34% lower footprint than traditional beef (8.97 and 6.88 kg CO2e kg−1 LW, respectively). Sheep meat had lower emissions than beef for the on-farm stage (6.01 kg CO2e kg−1 LW). For GWP*, the estimated footprint values were much lower, especially for sheep, where the national flock decreased over the last 20 years. National data on net carbon sequestration by trees within farms was significant and equated to 29% of the total on-farm GHG emissions. The meat processing stage contributed 2–4% of the carbon footprint, while post-processing was 2–6%.

Forecasting LIB prices has received significant attention due to the tightening of raw material markets. Additionally, the implementation of carbon pricing policies has highlighted the need to incorporate the carbon footprint of LIBs in price evaluation. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the carbon footprint, pricing trajectories, and forthcoming carbon pricing ramifications associated with LIBs. Firstly, the findings derived from the life-cycle carbon footprint assessment indicate that the global production volume-weighted average carbon footprint of EV battery packs spans 49.2–81.1 kgCO2eq/kWh, depending on the chosen end-of-life treatment. Strategic end-of-life selections, aligned with battery chemical composition, can diminish the carbon footprint by up to 46% relative to improper disposal methods. Notably, direct cathode recycling of NCA and NMC622 batteries exhibits superior environmental performance. Secondly, techno-economic analysis predicts that the mean price of EV battery packs with diverse chemical compositions will decline to $75.1/kWh by 2030, factoring in the compound annual growth rate of critical raw material prices over the past decade. LFP batteries emerge as the top economic performers. Lastly, the results reveal that monetizing a battery's carbon footprint may offset battery price reductions through learning effects. This underscores the imperative of effective recycling for curtailing the carbon footprint and ensuring the enduring economic and environmental competitiveness of LIBs.",,,

Understanding GHG emissions from potable water production is important because water treatment and distribution consume much energy while emitting a significant amount of GHG. With economic and population growth, water demand has increased, resulting in higher GHG emissions. This study aims to assess the CF of potable water production in Bangladesh, focusing on the country’s economic capital, Chattogram. This study estimates and compares the CF of the treatment, distribution, and consumption phases. It also estimates the CF of different water treatment plants (WTPs) during the treatment phase. WTPs use electricity for a full-scale operation, during which approximately 4.5 million m3 of raw water of varying turbidity is treated. This study calculates a country-specific GHG emission factor for Bangladesh’s electricity generation method as different sources produce different quantities of GHGs. This study also considers the energy consumed to distribute water from the WTPs to household rooftop tanks in the distribution phase. For the consumption phase, the study considers the energy consumption for domestic water treatment, which involves boiling of a portion of treated water for drinking purposes. The study estimates that approximately 0.18, 0.27, and 17.52kg CO2-eq are emitted in the treatment, distribution, and consumption phases, respectively, for the production of 1 m3 of water. Boiling at the consumption phase alone generates 97.48% of the total CF. The daily CFs for surface water and groundwater use in 2017 were 16,387.78 and 34,092.08kg CO2-eq, respectively; those in 2022 were 83,769.25 and 2,130.97kg CO2-eq, respectively.

Understanding the factors influencing these emissions is crucial in achieving a more sustainable pig husbandry. In two independent experiments, the impact of slaughter weight on the carbon footprint (CFP) of pig feed intake (CFPFI) was evaluated for growing-finishing pigs of different sexes (entire males (EM), barrows (BA), immunocastrates (IC) and gilts (GI)). In experiment 1 118 animals were raised individually in experimental conditions. In experiment 2 384 animals were housed in group (four pigs per pen), in controlled commercial farm circumstances. All animals were fed ad libitum in a three-phase feeding regime and slaughtered at different BW, ranging from 110 to 148 kg (experiment 1) and from 99 to 138 kg (experiment 2). When only the fattening period was considered, the CFPFI was expressed per kg carcass growth. When the production of piglets was also taken into account, the CFPFI was calculated per kg carcass weight. For all sexes, the heavier the pig, the higher the CFPFI per kg carcass growth (P < 0.05, experiment 1; P < 0.001, experiment 2) and per kg carcass weight (P < 0.05, experiment 1; P < 0.01, experiment 2). In addition, BA had a significantly higher CFPFI per kg carcass growth and per kg carcass weight compared to EM and IC and to EM, IC and GI in respectively experiments 1 and 2 (P < 0.001). When performing a desk study with a soy-free (i.e. reduced CFP) feed in the third phase of experiment 2, slaughter weight no longer affected the CFPFI per kg carcass growth (P = 0.133) and per kg carcass weight (P = 0.856). A higher slaughter weight thus implies a lower sustainability, unless a sufficiently low-CFP feed is provided in the finisher phase.",4,,

The objective of our study was to measure the ecological threat related to intravitreal injections. Methods Emissions were separated into scope 2 corresponding to Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) of the building, and scope 3 corresponding to travels (patients and staff), and life cycle assessment (LCA) of medical devices (MD) and pharmaceutics. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and waste for a single injection were first measured through a waste audit, and secondly anticipated theoretically with a calculator. Results The average GHG emissions and waste measured were 277kgCO2eq/IVI and 0.5kg/IVI, respectively. Pharmaceuticals were responsible for 97% of total emissions. Emissions unrelated to pharmaceuticals counted for 8.4kgCO2eq/IVI. GHG emissions and waste estimated with the calculator were 276kgCO2eq/IVI and 0.5kg/IVI, respectively, showing that the calculator was accurate.

Distance travelled is a main factor in this impact, but some of its determinants remain unexplored. We examined the role of tourists' holiday preferences in shaping the carbon footprint of leisure travel within the EU by calculating demand and impact indicators associated with eight holiday styles. We find a substantial and equivalent carbon footprint for visiting relatives, nature tourism and sea, sun and sand tourism, but a higher carbon intensity of travel per trip for the latter. This is due to widespread demand for sea, sun, and sand tourism despite the concentration of destinations in Southern Europe. Furthermore, international travel within the EU is on average three times more carbon intensive than domestic travel. Our insights suggest that tourists’ holiday preferences can be leveraged for the sustainable development of leisure travel within the EU.",,,

While general guidelines for carbon footprint calculation exist, they usually do not consider special characteristics of organisations such as institutions of higher education. Case studies can act then as learning tools, and comparisons between applied methodologies can be used to develop best practices. However, a lack of case studies published in peerreviewed journals limits access to the calculation results. This work provides a case study for a Northern European institution to extend the pool of available calculation methodologies tested under real-life conditions. The carbon footprint calculation of the University of Oulu utilises a hybrid model, combining approaches of Environmentally Extended Input-Output Analysis and Life-Cycle Assessment. The focus of the work was to consider included scopes and categories of emissions that represent indirect and non-energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, such as commuting or procurement of research and laboratory equipment. In 2019, the institution’s emission inventory sums up to 19,072 t CO2e, with the highest share due to the use of district heat on campus. Another goal of conducting this research was to show the limitations researchers might encounter when analysing caused emissions on an organisational level, and how the calculated carbon footprint can help to identify the best mitigation measures and possibilities for universities to reach carbon neutrality. It was found that the availability of information and missing strategies for data collection are prominent limiting factors. Favourable mitigation measures include the implementation of energysaving policies and improved policies for procurements.",,,

Hitherto, the role of its technical and infrastructural composition that drives carbon footprint from an ecological perspective is rarely discussed in the literature. Here, we use machine learning and econometric techniques to analyze the past, present, and future changes in Bitcoin's carbon footprint with daily data spanning July 18, 2010 to December 04, 2021. We document technical drivers, decomposition effects, causal nexus, and implications of the Bitcoin blockchain's increasing energy and carbon footprint. We show that Bitcoin's technical drivers could have potential impacts on Bitcoin's carbon footprint, and subsequently, global climate change. For example, the network's hashrate increases mining difficulty––thereby increasing Bitcoin's energy consumption and subsequently, carbon footprint. We observed a direct association between the marginal effect of block size and transaction count––implying that a higher block size improves transaction efficiency and then reduces Bitcoin's energy and carbon footprint. Besides, low mining difficulty increases market capitalization whereas increasing mining difficulty reduces bitcoin mining profit in the long run. This infers the reward for mining Bitcoin has a diminishing return in the long term. Thus, the adoption of advanced hardware for Bitcoin mining will spur energy and carbon intensity, yet will have a low return on investment. We highlight environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could limit Bitcoin's carbon footprint.",,,

To address this challenge, the present study has formulated a multi-objective optimization model that comprehensively incorporates two crucial aspects: carbon emissions from airport terminals and passenger comfort. Specifically, models for carbon emissions and indoor environmental air quality are developed, taking into account factors such as ambient temperature, light intensity, noise, and ventilation quality concerning both airport terminal emissions and passenger comfort. Building upon these models, a multi-objective programming framework is devised, considering practical operational constraints. To contend with uncertainties in model parameters, the model is evolved into a fuzzy optimization framework and thereafter solved by the fuzzy optimization theory. The model's viability is tested through a case study of Mianyang Airport's terminal in China's southwestern region. In the context of concurrently considering carbon emission reduction and optimizing indoor environmental quality, winter carbon emissions increased by 212.09% compared to summer, while indoor environmental quality declined by 5.68%.",,,

The first objective of this study was to experimentally determine the optimal intermittent aeration ratio for nutrient recovery from liquid dairy manure through an on-site pilot-scale reactor to partially reduce the required energy for the aerobic process. The second objective was to theoretically investigate the total carbon footprints of direct manure spreading on croplands and permanent manure storage in open anaerobic lagoons in response to nutrient removal by the optimal determined intermittent aerobic treatment ratio. Four scenarios (S) were included; S1 was the traditional scenario of manure spread on croplands without the aerobic pre-treatment, S2 was the modified scenario of manure spread on croplands that included the aerobic pre-treatment, S3 was the traditional scenario of manure storage in lagoons, and S4 was the modified scenario of manure storage in lagoons that included the aerobic pre-treatment. The results showed that comparable nutrient removal efficiencies could be obtained with a 5:1 intermittent aeration ratio. Total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were recovered were 41.5 ± 1.3% and 37.0 ± 4.0%, respectively, in ammonium sulfate and phosphorus-rich sludge, while 55.3 ± 1.4% of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) was removed.

However, the total carbon footprint of S2′ and S4′, which used renewable-based energy to run the reactor instead of fossil-based energy used in S2 and S4, were estimated to 29.5 and 37.5 kg CO2-eq ton−1, respectively. Clearly, applying the aerobic pre-treatment increased the total carbon footprint of all cases except S4′, in which the total carbon footprint was mitigated by −17.2%. Accordingly, the aerobic pre-treatment is only recommended in the case of S4’ from a carbon footprint point of view although it is an effective nutrient recovery technology.",,,

Hong Kong's building sector is responsible for approximately 60 % of carbon emissions, while its evolutionary trajectories and neutrality pathway remain unclear. To this end, we adopt the STIRPAT model and machine learning approach to identify the most relevant factors and determine their historical correlation with building energy consumption. Then, the out-of-sample prediction is conducted to explore the energy pathway and carbon footprint towards 2050 in the Hong Kong building sector under various assumptions and scenarios. The predicted results suggest that electricity consumption and carbon emissions will continue to increase following current trends. In a moderate scenario, if 2.2 % and 1.6 % of residential and commercial buildings are replaced annually with 2.75 % better energy-performance construction, their electricity consumption is likely to reach 30 %–40 % and 20 %–30 % from the 2015 level as the HK2050 required. With lower electricity emission intensity, the Hong Kong building sector could achieve near zero emissions.

This challenge is even more relevant in the most overexploited region of the world: The Mediterranean Sea. Here, we use the socio-ecological system of the Spanish Mediterranean commercial fisheries (Northern Alboran Sea, Northern Spain and the Balearic Islands) to develop an integrative impact assessment, including detailed socio-economic, ecosystem indices of the trophic structure of extractive fishery and CO2 emission analyses combining different gear, vessel size classes as well as a wide range estimation of carbon release from the seafloor by bottom trawling. Northern Alboran Sea preferentially requires reduction in purse seine fishery while in Northern Spain bottom trawling should be reduced first to reach sustainable exploitation. Fuel CO2 footprint of purse seine and bottom trawling are among the lowest footprints of animal protein production, but considering sweeping released CO2 from the seafloor the bottom trawling footprint becomes the animal protein production with the highest footprint. Moreover, the lowest bottom released CO2 estimation overrides 2.7–10 times the CO2 buried in the seafloor through the biological pump in trawled areas potentially turning the continental shelf from a CO2 sink to a CO2 source. Net profit per fuel derived CO2 emission for all fleets is lower than 1€ kgCO2−1, being lowest for large bottom trawler (0.025 € kgCO2−1). Thus, urgent mitigation and adaptation measures are necessary to obtain sustainable fishery in terms of net profit, sustainable seafood extraction and CO2 emission reduction. Our study provides scientific bases to develop these measures such as the restriction of harmful fishing gear in carbon rich river influenced areas, reduction of bottom contact of the fishing gear, favouring purse seine fishery and smaller bottom trawlers.",,,

However, this situation has gradually changed, as carbon footprint quantification in construction waste allows for performance benchmarking with other circular economy initiatives. This study presents the first systematic review of construction waste-related carbon emission accounting methods. By analysing 108 journal articles, the review identified seven types of activities (e.g., generation, transportation, sorting, reusing, recycling, landfilling, and incineration) contributing to carbon emissions across the construction waste lifecycle. They encompass four types of emission-producing unit processes: mechanical operation, manual operation, chemical reaction, and material replacement. Each has a distinct emission accounting formula, but follows a generalized principle “Emission per unit × Unit”. Also, existing studies exhibit five evolution trends in this research field: shifting from single-stage accounting to lifecycle assessment; from simple calculation to complex conversion; from project-scale to urban-scale emission investigation and management; from accounting exercises to policy implication; and from carbon accounting to mitigation strategies. Moreover, the review sheds light on three future research directions: the need for generalisable lifecycle emission quantification frameworks, comparisons of the carbon reduction potential among various waste disposal technologies, and consideration of cost analysis into carbon emission quantification. This study contributes to the development of sustainable construction waste management strategies aligned with the goals of the circular economy and carbon neutrality.",,,

We undertook a LCA for a utility-scale solar plant in Aotearoa New Zealand using monocrystalline silicon PERC bifacial panels, establishing the carbon, materials and energy footprint associated with the life cycle stages of the solar farm and its components. By comparing different databases for silicon processing up to the wafer slicing our results show that the GHG emissions of utility PV systems are lower (26.2 gCO2eq/kWh versus 40.4 gCO2eq/kWh), and the Energy Return on Investment (EROI) is higher (38 versus 20) when using updated databases, which reflects the advancements in the silicon processing activities.

However, the uncertainty of the emission level of China's food industry alongside the global supply chain restricts China from implementing more sustainable food policies. Thus, this paper first estimates the carbon footprint in China's food manufacturing industry domestically and internationally by identifying major trade partners and the corresponding industries using a multi-regional input-output model. Then, this paper further decomposed the determinants of carbon footprint change. The results show that agriculture, food industry, transport, and energy supply are primarily responsible for carbon emission growth. The structural decomposition results further demonstrate that increasing demand and consumption pattern changes are important factors leading to a growth in carbon emission, and energy efficiency improvement helps China's food industry mitigate the emission level. Finally, policy recommendations are provided based on the decomposition results.",,375,

In this paper, we analyse scenarios of carbon footprint reduction associated with a switch from flights to night trains for holidays in Europe for the case of Sweden, including outbound, inbound and domestic tourism. We use a prospective lifecycle assessment framework combined with results from a stated preference experiment to determine the impact of future mode shift behaviours. Our results indicate that a mode shift could be triggered by progressive night train policies resulting in (i) fewer transfers and (ii) price levels similar to those of flights. The shifts from flights to night trains could result in 9% lower cumulative carbon footprint in relation to a baseline travel demand scenario for the period 2025–2050. Decarbonization of long-distance travel in line with the Paris Agreement would likely require a combination of many different types of measures including a shift to low-carbon fuels.",,,

However, direct straw incorporation may increase the risks of greenhouse gas (GHG) and reactive nitrogen (Nr) emissions. Objective and methods To comprehensively evaluate whether straw-derived biochar is a feasible alternative to straw for increasing grain yields and soil C sequestration while reducing GHG and Nr emissions in cropland, we conducted a two-factor field trial on maize farmland in northwest China during 2019–2021. Factor one comprised three straw incorporation methods (straw removal (T), total straw incorporation (S), and straw-derived biochar incorporation (B; biochar application at a straw/biochar ratio of 33%)) and factor two comprised two nitrogen (N) fertilizer application rates (0 and 300 kg ha–1). The relative benefits of the treatments for the maize productivity, net ecosystem carbon budget (NECB), carbon footprint (CF), nitrogen footprint (NF), and net ecosystem economic benefits (NEEB) were comprehensively evaluated by using the life cycle assessment (LCA) and Z-score methods. Results N fertilizer application was the main factor that increased maize productivity, NECB, NF, and NEEB in the maize agroecosystem. Under conventional N application, NECB increased by 244.0% (1647.37 kg C ha–1 yr–1) under SN compared with TN, and heterotrophic respiration (Rh) and N2O emissions increased by 70.3% and 34.9%, respectively. By contrast, BN increased NECB by 295.8% (1996.79 kg C ha–1 yr–1), and decreased Rh and N2O emissions by 8.2% and 20.9%, respectively. Hence, BN reduced the net global warming potential (NGWP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) of the farmland ecosystems by 56.4% (1609.49 kg CO2-eq ha–1 yr–1) and 46.5%, respectively, compared with SN. Moreover, the grain yield, water use efficiency (WUE) and N use efficiency increased significantly under BN compared with TN. Compared to SN, integrated straw-derived biochar utilization (pre-farm abatement + BN management on the farm) reduced the average CF and NF of the maize agroecosystem by 350.2% (4004.85 kg CO2-eq ha–1 yr–1) and 16.5% (12.68 kg N-eq ha–1 yr–1), respectively, and improved NEEB by $ 624.7 ha–1 yr–1. Conclusions Integrated straw-derived biochar utilization may be applied as a sustainable and economical straw alternative to straw for enhancing soil C sinks and reducing GHG and Nr emissions. Implications or significance Integrated straw-derived biochar utilization is an economically friendly and sustainable method for straw utilization in dryland maize production, and highly significant for mitigating climate and environmental degradation.",,,

Most emission assessments have focused on the production and use phase of car sharing, but few have focused on the impacts of changes in consumption. In this article I assess changes in the total output from various sectors and in the carbon footprint of car sharing users from a consumption perspective. This study applied a mixed top-down and bottom-up approach using scenario analysis. It is based on a detailed expenditure analysis that links changes in expenditure to variations in the total output of sectors and the carbon footprint of personal mobility using environmentally extended multi regional input and output analysis. The results show that car sharing can change the total output of several sectors, with traceable climate consequences. Variations in total outputs from sectors depend on existing national economic structures. Car sharing users who abandoned private car ownership can decrease their carbon footprint of transport by approximately 40 %. Car sharing users with a car-free lifestyle who started using car sharing for 3 % of their vehicle kilometres travelled increased their transport carbon footprint by 0.42 % to 0.70 %. Meanwhile, the rebound effects of re-spending can be as high as 70 to 85 %. This indicates that the potential carbon savings from car sharing may be drastically reduced by non-transport related consumption. Differences between the carbon footprints of business-to-consumer and peer-to-peer car sharing users were marginal.",,249,

Quantifying the environmental benefits and resulting carbon footprint (CF) of integrating biochar and fertilizer treatments is paramount in facing intensified human activities of agricultural land expanding under climate change, especially in fragile inland catchments for saline-alkalis soils. A three−year field experiment was conducted with maize in the Tarim River Basin to monitor greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, maize yield, soil organic carbon (SOC), and CF from 2020 to 2022. This study involved seven treatments that varied in nitrogen (N) fertilizer, irrigation, and biochar applications: (i) 0N0W (0 kg N ha−1, 0 mm, 0 t ha−1 biochar), (ii) LNLW (100 kg N ha−1, 140 mm, 0 t ha−1 biochar), (iii) LNLWB (100 kg N ha−1, 140 mm,10 t ha−1 biochar), (iv) MNMW (200 kg N ha−1, 220 mm, 0 t ha−1 biochar), (v) MNMWB (200 kg N ha−1, 220 mm, 10 t ha−1 biochar), (vi) HNHW (300 kg N ha−1, 320 mm, 0 t ha−1 biochar) (conventional treatment), and (vii) HNHWB (300 kg N ha−1, 320 mm, 10 t ha−1 biochar).

The experiment consisted of three levels of tillage: conventional (CT), minimum (MT), and zero (ZT), and four levels of mulching: live, leaf litter, paddy straw, and no mulching. The results show that ZT tillage resulted in higher bulk density (BD) compared to other treatments, despite an increase in soil organic carbon (SOC). Live and leaf litter mulching led to slight reductions in BD in the upper soil layers. CT resulted in net depletion of SOC whereas ZT registered a positive sequestration rate of 1.19 Mg ha−1 yr−1. Live and leaf litter mulching increased SOC sequestration by 42.6% and 38.8% compared to paddy straw mulching, respectively. Initially, ZT resulted in a 10.3% reduction in system productivity compared to CT, while MT yields were comparable to CT. However, mulching regimes consistently improved production by 16.4%–25.2% as compared to no mulch. ZT and MT were found to be more affordable than CT, with cost savings of 18.2% and 6.8%, respectively. ZT had the highest B: C ratio, indicating better economic efficiency. Among the mulching treatments, live mulching was the most economical. Both ZT and MT saved input energy by approximately 22.9% and 13.5%, respectively compared to CT. Live mulching resulted in the highest net energy and energy output. Compared to CT, ZT reduced carbon footprint (CF) by 41.5 and 22.2% in rice and sweet corn, respectively.

Notably, we show that environment-friendly technology plays a crucial role in delaying depletion in Built-up land and contracting the depletion phase of Fishing Grounds along the Kuznets curve trajectory. The study, therefore, underscores the importance of environment-friendly technology in addressing environmental challenges and promoting environmental sustainability.",,,

The paper considers the Panel-corrected Standard Errors (PCSEs) and the Dynamic Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) estimations to empirically validate the hypothesis. The findings from different estimation techniques indicate that government efficiency reduces the ecological footprint. However, green technology raises the ecological footprint. Other indicators, such as the institutions' voice of accountability, control of corruption, and regulatory policy, do not significantly affect the ecological footprint. Therefore, the governments of the BRICS economies should encourage government efficiency by substituting cleaner energy and hydrogen economies in natural resources to achieve a net-zero emissions target by 2050.",,,

This goal can be accomplished by creating a new tourist destination that has a marine environment, similar to overseas destinations. Based on recent data, it is estimated that half a million Jordanians would prefer a domestic destination instead of traveling abroad, provided that it has a marine environment. This shift in travel preferences would result in an estimated reduction of 320,000 tons of CO2 emissions every year. The proposed new destination is an artificial lake created in the Jafer basin, located in southeastern Jordan. The area has a natural depression that is suitable for this purpose. The proposal involves excavating a 140 km-long tunnel connecting the Gulf of Aqaba to the Jafer basin, where seawater is pumped into the basin to create the lake, with a water volume of 2000 MCM. The design is based on keeping the water's level steady in the lake. The proposed design is shown to be feasible, with an optimal tunnel diameter of 4 m, excavated at constant depth. In order to maintain a uniform water pressure, 15 pumping stations should be installed along the tunnel. The total cost of the project is estimated at 5.5 B$. This cost is not only used for mitigating carbon footprint but also for increasing the real estate value of the area around the lake, and a more healthy distribution of population in the country.",,,

Exploring the nexus and internal mechanism between agricultural carbon footprint (CF), energy utilization and economic quality thereby implies practical significance. For these reasons, the current study intends to explore the nexus and internal mechanism between agricultural CF, energy utilization, and economic qualities of main grain-planting provinces in China. Multi-approaches like, Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model, the Granger Causality Test based on the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), and Impulse Response and Variance Decomposition (IRVD) methods, and a time-series data in the duration from 1997 to 2019 are employed. The findings indicate that: 1) Agricultural CF, energy utilization and economic quality demonstrate an increasing trend; 2) There exists environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) in agricultural CF in China's main grain-planting provinces; 3) Energy utilization negatively influenced agricultural CF in both the short-term and long-term; 4) In the short-term and long-term, a bidirectional causality exist among agricultural CF and economic quality, as well as a unidirectional causality from energy utilization to agricultural CF and economic quality.",,,

Although various studies and approaches are developed, none focus on news broadcasting organisations. Therefore, the carbon footprint of such organisations and carbon emission reduction strategies are not well understood. This lack of knowledge potentially undermines such organisations' sustainability and blocks their contribution to the higher level sustainability goals. To address this gap, for the first time, this study aims to explore and quantify the carbon footprint of news broadcasting organisations. The current study took Nieuwsuur, a Dutch news broadcasting organisation, as a case study. The results demonstrated that the news broadcasting organisation emits 235.28 t of CO2eq yearly. The study categorised the CO2 emissions into five main categories, namely: (i) travel and transport, (ii) office and studio, (iii) accommodation, (iv) materials, and (v) waste, which for each of them sub-categories have been defined and studied. Travel and transport contributed the most to the carbon footprint of such organisations. Within this category, air travel has the most significant share (27 % of total emissions), which cannot be mitigated due to the nature of news broadcasting organisations. In contrast, commuter travel and outsourced travel (together with 37.6 % of total emissions) have considerable potential for reducing carbon emissions. The following categories are office and studio, with 20.7 % of total emissions and materials, with 4.9 % of total emissions. The study recommended that working from home and outsourcing from sustainable companies are the easiest and most effective carbon reduction strategies. Other emissions reduction strategies are discussed for each category, and recommendations are provided.",,268,

However, the implementation of irrational water and fertilizer regimes in greenhouse vegetable fields (GVF) has resulted in adverse environmental impacts. Therefore, it is crucial to develop water and fertilizer regimes to maintain the productivity of greenhouse vegetables with less carbon (C) and reactive nitrogen (Nr) footprint. A four growing seasons experiment involving the cultivation of cucumbers and tomatoes was conducted in the suburbs of Beijing. The experiment comprised three treatments: flood irrigation with a conventional urea-N application (FN), drip fertigation with a conventional urea-N application (DN), and drip fertigation with a 50% reduction of urea-N application (DRN). The results showed that about 70% of annual N inputs in GVF were surplus, posing a high risk of loss. For the FN treatment, the N budget, Nr loss, Nr footprint per unit of vegetable yield (NrFY), Nr footprint per unit of net return (NrFR), greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, C footprint per unit of vegetable yield (CFY), C footprint per unit of net return (CFR) were respectively quantified as follows: 1653 kg N ha−1 yr−1, 776 kg N ha−1 yr−1, 4.39 kg N t−1 yr−1, 24.48 kg N ¥10000−1 yr−1, 46548 kg CO2-eq ha−1 yr−1, 262.98 kg CO2-eq t−1 yr−1 and 1467.58 kg CO2-eq ¥10000−1 yr−1. Compared with FN, DN significantly reduced Nr loss (25%), NrFY (24%), NrFR (22%), GHG emissions (6%), CFY (4%), while it increased N surplus (9.7%) and produced lower farmers' net return (¥ 13486 ha−1 yr−1). Concurrently, DRN significantly reduced the N surplus, Nr loss, NrFY and NrFR by ∼35%, decreased the GHG emissions, CFY and CFR by ∼20%, and improved farmers' net return by ¥ 674 ha−1 yr−1 compared to FN treatment. Therefore, this study highlighted that an integrated water and fertilizer regulation strategy (drip irrigation replacing flood irrigation coupled with a 50% reduction in chemical N application) can simultaneously achieve environmental and economic benefits in the context of high N inputs. This contributes to the sustainable development of intensive vegetable cultivation systems.",,,

However, there remains a lack of studies that clarify the sources and potential of rural household carbon footprint in China. In this study, we estimated the rural household carbon footprint of 30 provinces in China’s mainland in 2007, 2012, and 2017 based on the Multi-Regional Input-Output model, and investigated the transition patterns with a consideration of the trends, regional differences, driving forces, and structural changes. Results revealed that the carbon footprint of rural household consumption in China grew by 83% from 2007 to 2017 and displayed a weak decoupling from income growth. The transition patterns were observed from three perspectives: Firstly, the primary driving force behind the growth was income increase, while the decrease in carbon footprint intensity slowed down the growth significantly. Secondly, housing and direct emission contributed to 62% of the growth in rural household carbon footprint, while health care, transportation, and other services showed increasing contributions. Lastly, there were notable “higher in the north, lower in the south” regional differences in the per capita rural household carbon footprint, and the gap tended to increase. The main reasons for the regional differences were intensity change, income increase, housing consumption, and direct emission. Our findings can offer decision-making support to guide rural household consumption towards achieving carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals.",,,

Three powerful non-linear intelligent learners, including Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with Response Surface Methodology (RSM), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Standalone Decision Tree Regression (DTR) are employed. The models are developed using seven input features related to the curing temperature, fly ash content, concentrations of coarse and fine aggregates, alkaline activators (Na2SiO3, NaOH) content, and superplasticizer. To identify the most influential input features, three different combinations (combo-1, combo-2, and combo-3) of these features are utilized in model building. The models' performance is assessed using key metrics such as coefficient of correlation (CC), Nash Sutcliffe coefficient efficiency (NSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). During the verification phase, the GPR-3 [Combo-3] model emerges as the most efficient in predicting the CO2-FP, with a high CC value of 0.9645 and NSE value of 0.9292. Consistently, Combo-3 demonstrates superior performance across all the models, underscoring the significance of the selected features.

The sewage treatment is composed of pre-treatment, followed by treatment in upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors, trickling filter and secondary decanter, post-treatment with disinfection, and biogas recovery in the three-phase separator of the UASB reactor. The methods used in this study were attributional life cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis – LCA and TEA, respectively. The energy demand, carbon footprint and financial cost for 1 m3 sewage treatment in the evaluated scenario without d-CH4 recovery (S1) were 3.4 MJ, 1.7 kg CO2eq and 0.17 USD respectively, while those with d-CH4 recovery (S2) varied by 12%, −16% and 2.3% compared to S1. The produced biogas for lower heating value in S2 (2.6 MJ) was 27% higher than that in S1 (2.0 MJ) and this varied from 1.3 MJ to 4.6 MJ in the scenarios for different influent chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the sewage treatment plant (STP) and COD removal efficiency in the UASB reactor. The highest eco-efficiency for 1 MJ heat production from the STP biogas was achieved in the scenario with d-CH4 recovery, higher influent COD, higher COD removal efficiency in the UASB reactor, d-CH4 saturation, photovoltaic electricity supply, and a higher energy efficiency in d-CH4 recovery combined (S2,COD+,R+,S,PV,EE+), which reduced the energy demand by 55%, carbon footprint by 66% and financial cost by 63% compared to S1. Furthermore, the STP functionality change from a single-product (biogas) to a multi-product (biogas, water for reuse and biosolid fertilizer) approach (S1,WR, BF and S2,WR,BF) made the biogas a competitive product compared to those from fossil sources. Therefore, resource recovery from the sewage treatment in higher influent COD, higher COD removal efficiency, the use of a more efficient, clean and economical electricity source and higher energy efficiency in d-CH4 recovery in a multi-product STP contribute to achieving the energy self-sufficiency over the life cycle while reducing the carbon footprint and financial cost of its products.",,,

For quantitative diagnosis of farming performance, the paper presented an on-farm water, energy, food, and carbon-footprint (WEFC) nexus index made up of four equally pillars. The arithmetic average preserved the multi-centric approach and equal importance of the four pillars. The index was applied to test and rank 2,042 wheat-based farmer fields in Egypt representing diverse inputs, agronomic and irrigation practices, soil types, and agroecological conditions. The water metric was the ratio of saved water, difference between maximum water consumption recorded in the country and actual water consumption, to the maximum water consumption. Likewise, the energy metric was obtained. The food metric was the ratio of actual yield to maximum yield in the country. The carbon-footprint metric was the ratio of difference between maximum CO2 emission in the country and actual emission to the maximum emission. The index values showed a wide range from 18.69% to 87.33% with a high standard deviation emphasizing the diversity of farming practices, soil types, and agroecological conditions. The highest ten values were recorded in fields with sandy soils, relatively large area, drip irrigation, recommended seeding and fertilization rates, well drainage, weeds removal, and tillage. The drip irrigation system in 51 out of 52 fields had above average value. The lowest ten values were in fields with clay soils and flood irrigation, where 18.7% of 1,780 fields exceeded the above average value. Raised beds with furrow irrigation in 83.15% of 184 fields exceeded the above average value. Fertilization rates of nitrogen and phosphorus in 61% and 53% of fields respectively exceeded the recommended rates with no significant reflection on the food metric. The low index values in fields with flood irrigation were attributed to high water losses causing high water consumption, energy consumption, and CO2 emission. The index was a good indicative of input resources consumption and output production as it varied inversely with water and energy consumption and CO2 emission and proportionally with yield. Since the high-water consumption was the main entry point for low index values in fields with flood irrigation, changing the irrigation to drip system or revisiting the irrigation scheduling and the estimated applied irrigation water amount were recommended. The index can be utilized to quantify the effectiveness of both recommendations and further new site-specific interventions and to assess their impact at scale. The index also recommended land use consolidation where farmers retain ownership of their lands but with cooperative farming.",,130,

The compressive strength of concrete is often the only design consideration. Premature kerb failure is common indicating that only considering compressive strength in design may not be sufficient. Flexural/bending strength, deflection capacity, impact resistance, water absorption/sorption, abrasion resistance, and freeze-thaw resistance can also be important. The use of recycled products in concrete has been an active area of research in recent years and concrete produced from recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) and tyre-derived aggregate (TDA) could be a cleaner and more sustainable alternative to conventional concrete. In this study, ten different concrete mixes were developed for a target strength of 25 MPa and tested for mechanical and durability properties. Significant variations in the mechanical properties of different concrete were observed despite all concrete having similar compressive strength. The addition of TDA was found to improve flexural strength, deflection, and abrasion resistance properties, however, it led to inferior impact resistance and higher shrinkage compared to control concrete. A carbon footprint analysis showed that the use of 100% RCA (replacing natural aggregates) could drastically reduce the carbon footprint of concrete. For concrete with TDA aggregate, some environmental benefits of recycling TDA may get offset by the additional binder requirement to achieve the desired compressive strength.",,,

A field experiment was conducted for seven consecutive cycles with three rice-based cropping systems (C1: rice-mustard-jute; C2: rice-wheat-maize+greengram; C3: rice-lentil-sesame) under multiple irrigated conditions and four nutrient management practices (NPK fertilizers and biogas slurry (BGS) in various combinations). Comprehensive assessment of system productivity as well as sustainability, nutrient balance, energy and carbon footprint (CF) of different cropping systems under the influence of inorganic-organic fertilization were analysed to know the possible environmental impact. Irrespective of the cropping systems, the highest system rice equivalent yield (REY) (7.78 t ha−1) was recorded with 100% NPK fertilizers, whereas, substitution of chemical fertilizers with BGS for supplying a part of N, P and K requirement of different crops in the cropping system resulted in higher sustainable yield index (SYI). Positive apparent soil N and P balance were observed irrespective of cropping systems and nutrient management practices, however, the soils under all the treatments suffered an apparent loss of K. The rice-wheat-maize+green gram (C2) system dominated in terms of productivity and soil fertility, over the others, whereas substitution of NPK fertilizers by BGS resulted in a significant increase of available N, P, K, S, B and cationic micronutrient (Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn) content in the soil over 100% NPK fertilizers. However, sole application of BGS resulted in higher build-up of soil organic carbon. The energy ratio was higher in the rice-mustard-jute cropping system with 100% NPK fertilizers application (6.57 and 6.13 kg MJ−1 respectively) due to higher energy output to input balance, however, the specific energy was higher in the rice-lentil-sesame system with sole BGS application (6.13 and 6.25 kg MJ−1 respectively). In contrast to the C output and carbon footprint (CF), the carbon sustainability index (CSI) was reported highest in the rice-mustard-jute system (12.28) while the lowest was recorded in the rice-wheat-maize+green gram system (9.14). Therefore, legume inclusive cropping along with organic nutrient sources could be considered as an effective option to maintain crop productivity, soil nutrients and energy balance while reducing carbon footprints in the areas where intensive cultivation is predominated.",,,

Among the multiple factors that explain the HCF, some previous research has confirmed the relevance of gender. In this paper, we calculate the HCF of individual Spanish households using an environmentally extended multi-regional input-output model (EEMRIO) that quantifies the emissions embedded in the supply chain of goods and services that households consume. We assess the differences in consumption and emissions patterns, measuring the gender effect by a new variable, the female share of the household. This represents a remarkable improvement over previous literature that used simpler approaches. Moreover, we assess the partial effect of gender on HCF using multivariate regressions for total and sectoral emissions. Our results show that households with a majority of men have a higher HCF and carbon intensity. Even when controlling for economic, sociodemographic, and regional factors there are differences in the sectoral emissions according to gender. Female households spend more (and generate more emissions) on housing and food products, while male households show that pattern for restaurants and transport. These results can help orientate environmental campaigns and demand-side mitigation policies.",,,

Two models have been employed; the first incorporates carbon emissions, while the second integrates ecological footprint considerations. The results indicate a positive association between oil consumption and economic growth concerning carbon emissions and ecological footprint. Conversely, an adverse effect is observed for renewable energy, showing a mitigating impact on both carbon emissions and ecological footprint. Additionally, the study reveals a positive correlation between institutional quality and carbon emissions, with a contrasting negative effect of institutional quality on the ecological footprint at lower quantiles. A positive correlation is found between institutional quality and ecological footprint at the upper quantiles. This study advocates for an integrated resources policy that strategically incorporates renewable energy to mitigate carbon emissions and ecological footprint. Recognizing the significant influence of institutional quality on environmental outcomes, the findings underscore the importance of aligning economic development with environmental stewardship.

The model was constructed with carbon emission and water consumption coefficients, and a database was built. The results showed that the operational stage of pig farm accounted for most of the carbon footprint (49.3–84.9 %) and water footprint (65.5–92.5 %). Building materials production ranked second in carbon (12.0–42.5 %) and water footprints (4.4–24.9 %), and pig farm maintenance ranked third in carbon (1.7–5.7 %) and water footprints (0.7–3.6 %). Notably, the mining and production stages of building materials contributed the largest carbon and water footprints of pig farm construction. Masonry materials have a significant impact on the overall carbon and water footprints of the pig farm. Pig farm using aerated concrete could reduce 41.1 % of the total carbon footprint and 58.9 % of the total water footprint compared to that using coal gangue sintered brick and autoclaved fly ash brick. This study presented a BIM-enabled method for carbon and water footprint analysis of pig farms and illustrated how the model can be used to facilitate the low carbon design of agricultural buildings.",,,

Despite the increasing awareness of global warming and the carbon footprint issue, food culture in different societies is difficult to change. Food production and storage are related to food security. The assessment of food-related carbon footprint should be linked with the chain of food lines rather than food items per se. It is obvious that much of the carbon emission is contributed by the production of it, packaging, storage, transportation, modification, quality control, and other related logistics. Therefore, this research investigated the correlation between food consumption and carbon footprint in the two types of diets and different populated regions. A systematic literature review combined with a bibliometric analysis approach was taken to construct the discussion. It studied the sources of carbon footprint and the life cycle of daily diet consumption and compared the carbon footprint of animal and plant-based diets. An evaluation of carbon footprint from various dietary patterns in India, China, and Italy was qualitatively carried out based on the published data in different scientific databases, and quantified values were discussed. Animal-based protein diets, especially meat, were found to have a higher contribution of carbon footprint; rice, however, contributes the highest among the plant-based diets. The bibliometric analysis pointed to the academic engagement on food-related carbon footprint issues across the globe and the scope of improvement. This review will help researchers to construct a thematic framework, and policymakers reorient the policy implementation.",,,

In the base period, UFV emitted a total of 3492.46 MgCO2e. When considering the existing tree vegetation, it was found that the removal was 8547.76 MgCO2e, making the carbon balance negative, with a balance of 5055.30 MgCO2e. The emission index per total area was 2.13 MgCO2e.ha−1. year−1, the emission index per constructed area was 81.03 MgCO2e.ha−1. year−1, and the carbon footprint was 0.19 MgCO2e.person−1. year−1. It is concluded that the carbon balance is negative, indicating that the removal of carbon is greater than the emission of GHG.

This study examines global CO2 emissions driven by household consumption (i.e., household carbon footprints, HCFs) of 34 age groups in China's 30 provinces and uncovers relevant socioeconomic influencing factors. Results show that China's population aging (i.e., the proportion of the elderly population) is conducive to global CO2 emission reduction during 2011–2014. This trend is mainly due to the relatively lower per capita HCFs of the elderly (1.7 t in 2014). In contrast, the per capita HCFs of the youth group are higher (3.3 t in 2014), mainly affected by the large expenditure on residence and transportation & communication. In addition, the HCFs of all age groups have increased during 2011–2014. Per capita expenditure is the most significant driver of this increase. The decline in CO2 emission intensity makes the largest contribution to reducing the HCFs of the youth group. For the aged group, expenditure structure change is the largest contributor to HCFs reduction. These findings reveal the differentiated impacts of China's household consumption by age on global CO2 emissions. This study lays the scientific foundation for deriving amelioration policies and achieving emission reduction targets in the process of population aging.",,,

The rapid growth of cryptocurrencies has raised concerns regarding the environmental impact of this energy-intensive type of currency. In this study, water and carbon footprints associated with cryptocurrencies are assessed. These environmental footprints are then compared to the water and carbon footprints associated with conventional currencies, which is a novelty of this study. A spatially refined, bottom-up analysis of the most energy-intensive aspects of each financial system is used in the comparison of these systems. Specifically, the energy use for printing money, bank branches, automated teller machines (ATM), and cashless transactions is evaluated at the country level and compared to the energy use of crypto mining around the world. Cryptocurrencies’ electricity use of 236 × 106 megawatt hours (MWh) in 2021 surpassed that of the conventional transaction system, despite cryptocurrencies representing less than 0.5% of global cashless financial transactions. In terms of its water footprint, cryptocurrencies have an annual water consumption of 3670 × 106 cubic meters (m3). Cryptocurrencies' water footprint is more than double that of conventional currencies because crypto mining takes place in countries with higher water intensities for electricity. Crypto mining activities are also estimated to result in almost 139 × 106 tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) of global greenhouse gas emissions. While cryptocurrencies represent a small percentage of financial transactions, their environmental impact is much larger than the conventional financial transaction system. This study shows how regulatory changes, such as the 2021 crypto mining ban in China, and crypto mining location can have implications on the environmental footprint associated with cryptocurrency.",,,

Results show that carbon footprint labels led to a decrease in the probability of selecting a high-carbon footprint meal by approximately 2.7 percentage points with consumers substituting to mid-carbon impact meals. We find no change in the market share of low-carbon meals, on average. The reduction in high-carbon footprint meals is driven by decreases in sales of meat meals while sales of mid-ranged vegan, vegetarian and fish meals all increased. We estimate that the introduction of carbon footprint labels was associated with a 4.3% reduction in average carbon emissions per meal. We contrast our findings with those from nudge-style interventions and discuss the cost-effectiveness of carbon footprint labels. Our results suggest that carbon footprint labels present a viable and low-cost policy tool to address information failure and harness climatarian preferences to encourage more sustainable food choices.",,,

This research employed primary and secondary data collection methods. Primary data sources included interviews and experimental observations from seven counties in Hubei collected from June 2016 to December 2016. Secondary data sources—including national datasets, inter-governmental reports, and peer-reviewed articles—were used to extract relevant data, such as emission factors, and national and provincial rice output. Life Cycle Assessment was employed to build a comprehensive inventory and map of the rice carbon footprint, including the following five stages: production inputs, farm management, growth period, processing and sale, and consumption. Uncertainty analysis was performed to validate the reliability of carbon footprint estimations. Results showed that the carbon footprint for every 1 ton of polished rice in Hubei ranged between 4.19–6.81 t CO2e/t and was 5.39 t CO2e/t on average. Greenhouse gas emissions were primarily produced from rice fields during the growth stage (over 60% of greenhouse gas emissions of the whole life cycle of rice), followed by the consumption stage, and the production and transportation of agricultural inputs. Uncertainty analysis estimations indicated acceptable levels of reliability. This study's results indicate that the production and consumption of rice is a significant contributor to agricultural carbon emissions in Hubei—consistent with national estimates that place China as the largest carbon dioxide emitter globally.

Our results revealed that the average annual per capita GHG emissions from dwellings in the city are 45% higher than those from personal transportation, highlighting the urgent need for greater emphasis on reducing GHG emissions from dwellings in high-latitude cities. We found that per capita floor area is positively correlated with GHG emissions. The findings also indicate that per capita HEGHG emissions significantly increase with increasing neighbourhood income levels (r = 0.8). An increase in the percentage of households struggling to afford homeownership is also associated with a decrease in HEGHG emissions (r = -0.3).

These smallholder dairy farms are often considered to emit substantial greenhouse gases (GHG) but are poor in productive performances. Therefore, it is crucial to estimate the carbon footprint (CF) of milk production of the smallholder Indian dairy farms. The primary objectives of the study were (1) Assessing the CF of milk production of smallholder dairy farms through life cycle analysis in south-interior Karnataka, India; (2) Identifying the hotspots of GHG emissions and significant factors influencing the CF of milk production in smallholder dairy production system. The study accounted GHG emissions from different sources and considered multiple functions of the smallholder production system. Estimations were made based on primary data collected from 47 farms and associated secondary data. For estimating the CF of milk production, the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) on a CO2-equivalent (CO2-eq) basis from feed production, enteric fermentation, manure management, transport and energy usage were allocated to fat- and protein-corrected milk (FPCM) based on mass balance, price (crop byproducts and residues) and feed digestibility. Principal component analysis and stepwise linear regression analysis were performed to identify the major factors influencing the CF. The average total GHG emissions (kg CO2-eq yr−1 farm−1) attributable to milk production based on mass, economic, and digestibility allocations were 8,936, 8,641, and 8,759, respectively. The contributions of CH4, N2O, and CO2 to the total farm GHG emission were 70.6%, 20.5%, and 7.69%, respectively. The major emission hotspots were CH4 emission from enteric fermentation (66.8%) and GHG emission from feed production (23.0%). The average CF of cradle-to-dairy cooperative milk production varied from 1.45 to 1.81 kg CO2-eq kg FPCM−1. The CF of milk production was more than 2-fold greater, when milk yield was below 3,500 kg lactating cow−1 yr−1. The FPCM yield 100 kg body weight−1, dry matter intake, and CH4 emission from manure management were the strongest determinants of the CF and explained 83.4% of the observed variation. The study emphasized the importance of considering multiple functions of a mixed crop-livestock-based dairy production system for estimating CF per unit of product. The results suggest that maintaining high-yielding dairy animals and adopting appropriate feeding strategies for better feed utilization are the possible effective interventions for reducing the CF of milk production.",12,8860,

The ongoing debate within the European Union and the empirical contradictions in the literature, coupled with the overall singular-dimensionality surrounding the impacts of nuclear energy on the environment, necessitate a broader and comprehensive examination of its effects across various environmental dimensions. These dimensions include the presence of CO2 emissions and the ecological footprint generated. The findings reveal that nuclear energy adoption by countries tends to affect CO2 emissions but this relationship goes from CO2 to nuclear energy consumption as per the causality test, while the ecological footprint variable does not exhibit a causal relationship with nuclear energy consumption. We estimated that a higher presence of air pollutants promotes the generation of nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuel energy sources. The study highlights that while nuclear energy generation produces no air pollution, it does impose significant land use requirements, potentially leading to ecosystem degradation. Factors such as uranium extraction, nuclear waste management, disposal, and accidents contribute to this impact. Further research is needed to understand the specific mechanisms and factors contributing to the observed environmental degradation associated with nuclear energy generation.",,,

However, comprehensive analyses assessing the effects of straw combined with decomposing inoculants on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, net primary production (NPP), the net ecosystem carbon budget (NECB), and the carbon footprint (CF) in farmland ecosystems are scant. Here, we carried out a 2-year field study in a wheat cropping system with six treatments: rice straw (S), a straw-decomposing Bacillus subtilis inoculant (K), a straw-decomposing Aspergillus oryzae inoculant (Q), a combination of straw and Bacillus subtilis inoculant (SK), a combination of straw and Aspergillus oryzae inoculant (SQ), and a control with no rice straw or decomposing inoculant (Control). We found that all the treatments resulted in a positive NECB ranging between 838 and 5065 kg C ha−1. Relative to the Control, the S treatment increased CO2 emissions by 16%, while considerably enhancing the NECB by 349%. This difference might be attributed to the straw C input and an increase in plant productivity (NPP, 30%). More importantly, in comparison to that in S, the NECB in SK and SQ significantly increased by 27–35% due to the positive response of NPP to the decomposing inoculants. Although the combination of straw and decomposing inoculants yielded a 3% increase in indirect GHG emissions, it also exhibited the lowest CF (0.18 kg CO2-eq kg−1 of grain). This result was attributed to the synergistic effects of straw and decomposing inoculants, which reduced direct N2O emissions and increased wheat productivity. Overall, the findings of the present study suggested that the combined amendment of straw and decomposing inoculants is an environmentally sustainable management practice in wheat cropping systems that can generate win–win scenarios through improvements in soil C stock, crop productivity, and GHG mitigation.",,,

Here, we examined the impacts of six fertilization treatments including unfertilized control (CK), mineral nitrogen (N, 90 kg N ha−1), mineral N plus 30 kg P ha−1 phosphorus (NP), NP combined with 3.75 Mg ha−1 straw (NP + Str), farmyard manure (Man, 75 Mg ha−1), and NP combined with manure (NP + Man) on crop productivity and carbon emissions (soil GHG emission; GHGI, yield-based GHG intensity; NGHGB, net GHG balance; carbon footprint, CF) in a maize-wheat cropping system during two years (April 2018–June 2020) in a semi-arid continental climate after 40 years of fertilization in the Northwest China. Manure and straw increased total GHG by 38–60 % compared to the mineral fertilizers alone, which was mainly due to the 49–80 % higher direct emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) rather than nitrous oxide (N2O). Compared to the N fertilizer alone, organic amendments and NP increased cumulative energy yield by 134–202 % but decreased GHGI by 38–55 %, indicating that organic fertilizers increased crop productivity at the cost of higher GHG emissions. When the soil organic carbon changes (ΔSOC) were accounted for in the C emission balance, manure application acted as a net C sink due to the NGHGB recorded with −123 kg CO2-eq ha−1 year−1. When producing the same yield and economic benefits, the manure and straw addition decreased the CF by 59–85 % compared to N fertilization alone. Overall, the transition from mineral to organic fertilization in the semi-arid regions is a two-way independent solution to increase agricultural productivity along with the reduction of C emissions.",,,

Also, the impact of adopting solar photovoltaics (PV) based hybrid power systems on overall CO2 emissions from operation of telecom towers. Optimal designs of solar PV-based hybrid systems are obtained using HOMER software for 25 diverse Indian locations for powering both 4G and 5G telecom towers while considering site-specific factors such as solar resource availability, availability and tariff of grid electricity and the unit price of diesel used in the Diesel Generator (DG) of the hybrid system. From the results of the study it is noted that, with the current energy supply mix, a tripling of the carbon dioxide emissions is expected if all of India's 0.71 million telecom towers adopt 5G technology. Adoption of solar PV-based systems along with grid electricity and diesel generator in hybrid mode has the potential to reduces carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 55 % for the existing telecom towers in India. For the case of all telecom towers transitioning to 5G technology, about 58 % reduction in CO2 emissions is possible with the adoption of PV-based hybrid power systems. From the perspective of the unit cost of CO2 emissions mitigation, the adoption of solar PV-based hybrid systems is found to be a no regret option. Results of the study have significant policy implications towards designing appropriate strategies for reducing carbon footprint of telecom tower operation in India.",,,

One of the available tools of the international scientific community to measure the impact of human activity on the environment, is to record and quantify the carbon footprint, in other words, the total greenhouse gas emissions of a product (or service) throughout its life cycle. The present paper focuses on the above issues and presents the methodology and the outcome of a real case study, aiming to lead to useful conclusions. In this framework a study has been made in order to calculate and analyze the carbon footprint of a wine making company that is based in northern Greece. One of the most important conclusions of this work is the overwhelming share (54 %) that Scope 3 has to the total Carbon Footprint, compared to Scope 1 (25 %) and Scope 2 (21 %), as it is vividly shown in the above Graphical Abstract. While the operation of a wine making company is divided in two main steams, Vineyard and Winery, it is concluded, that the Emissions of the Vineyard participate by 32 % in the total Emissions, while the Emissions of the Winery by 68 % respectively. Significant point of the case study is the total Absorptions that had been calculated to cover almost the 52 % of the total Emissions.",,,

Countries should keep balance with the three major proportions of the global energy trilemma: energy security, affordability, energy access, and ecological balance to construct a solid basis for competitiveness and prosperity. In this regard, this study examines the influence of nuclear energy, technological innovations, renewable energy, non-renewable energy, and natural resources on carbon footprint in the highest nuclear energy-producing countries from 1990 to 2019. To do this, we developed an inclusive and comprehensive empirical investigation and applied modern econometric approaches. Panel second-generation long-run cointegration advocates long-run associations among the series. The findings reveal that nuclear and renewable energy consumption extensively improve environmental excellence. Conversely, technological innovations and non-renewable energy significantly reduce environmental sustainability. Moreover, natural resources play an adverse role in long-run. The findings of the panel causality test discovered unidirectional causality is running from carbon footprint to nuclear energy. Additionally, bidirectional causality exists between technological innovations, renewables, non-renewables, and natural resources with carbon footprint. This recommends that these nations should integrate energy policy activities and develop energy strategy consistency by harmonizing the vital global nuclear energy aspects to assist a well-calibrated energy structure.",,,

In this research, two vehicle models of comparable size from each category were compared using life cycle analysis (ICEV and EV). The ICEV is a Ford Transit van, while the EV is a Ford E-transit van, both of which are supposed to have a lifespan of 150,000 km for comparison. Carbon footprint for both vehicles is examined from cradle-to-grave: including raw material production, manufacturing, transportation, operation, and decommissioning.

The Ford transit van emits 469.1 gCO2-eq/km and the Ford E-transit van emits 363.2 gCO2eq/km during a vehicle's lifetime. The impact of electricity generating in each U.S. states on the carbon footprint of ICEVs and EVs showed that the use of renewable energy sources for power generation would result in a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.

This study aims to address this gap by integrating CFP, EFP, toxicity, and economic assessments to evaluate the eco-environmental impacts of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The results indicate that the total CFP was below 0.6 kg CO2/kg COD removed, which is attributed to CO2 offset and biogas recovery. However, site-specific EFP varied considerably from 482.7 to 2294 kgCO2/kWh due to design differences of WWTPs and their aeration and mixing energy demand (46.96–66.1%). The use of crude oil and natural gas for electricity generation significantly increased EFP, CFP, and carcinogenic human toxicity. In contrast, a combined heat and power (CHP) installation enabled energy recovery ranging from 12.09% to 65.65%. Construction costs dominated the highest share of total costs (85.43%), with indirect construction costs (42.9%) and operation labor costs (61.4%) being the primary elements in the total net costs. It is worth noting that site-specific CO2 emission factors were used in the calculations to decrease model uncertainty.

However, intercity comparisons and responsibility allocations among cities are hindered because cost- and time-effective methods to calculate the carbon footprints of global cities have yet to be developed. Here, we establish a hybrid method integrating top-down input–output analysis and bottom-up crowdsourced data to estimate the carbon footprints of global cities. Using city purchasing power as the main predictor of the carbon footprint, we estimate the carbon footprints of 465 global cities in 2020. Those cities comprise 10% of the global population but account for 18% of the global carbon emissions showing a significant concentration of carbon emissions. The Gini coefficients are applied to show that global carbon inequality is less than income inequality. In addition, the increased carbon emissions that come from high consumption lifestyles offset the carbon reduction by efficiency gains that could result from compact city design and large city scale. Large climate benefits could be obtained by achieving a low-carbon transition in a small number of global cities, emphasizing the need for leadership from globally important urban centres.",,,

Whilst there has been an improved understanding of the global warming potential of centralized urban water infrastructure, rigorous analyses of smaller-scale rural systems are rare. This work adopts a life cycle assessment to ascertain the global warming potential of existing drinking water treatment works and wastewater treatment works associated with five Scottish islands: Arran, Iona, Jura, Barra, and Vatersay. The water systems, from source to sink, along with the use of chemicals, transportation, energy, and the reuse of waste products from water infrastructure are considered. The global warming potentials of the island's drinking water treatment works ranged from 0.18 to 0.79 kgCO2-eq/m3 of drinking water, while that for wastewater treatment works were 0.51 to 1.14 kgCO2-eq/m3 of wastewater. The global warming potential for water services on the islands can be as much as 7-times of that water services across Scotland as previously reported. Major global warming potential contributor in drinking water treatment works was the electricity consumed by the membrane bioreactors. The modelled direct emission of methane from sludge in septic tanks and for land reclamation made the largest contribution to global warming potential. It was also highly sensitive to model parameters, which highlights the need for a comprehensive exploration of process emissions from septic tanks and sludge handling. This analysis of existing rural water infrastructure is a baseline against which potential alternative low-carbon technology configurations can be compared.",,,

And a comprehensive evaluation of the effect of different approaches to estimate the delayed emission of biogenic carbon on the GHG footprints of different WBP types is still missing. This study aims to quantify: i) the GHG footprint of WBPs produced in China, and ii) the influence of different methods to assess the delayed emission of biogenic carbon. Cradle-to-gate life cycle models are developed for plywood (PLY), fiberboard (FB), particleboard (PB) and oriented strand boards (OSB). Based on two common end-of-life (EoL) destinations (i.e., incineration and landfill), three approaches to the estimation of the delayed emissions of biogenic carbon in cradle-to-grave assessments are compared. The cradle-to-gate results show that the GHG footprints of PLY, FB, PB and OSB without considering biogenic carbon storage are 538 kg CO2 e/m³, 406 kg CO2 e/m³, 348 kg CO2 e/m³ and 552 kg CO2 e/m³, respectively. For the four types of WBPs, resources extraction stage provides the largest contribution to the GHG footprints (55%–81%), followed by the production process (18%–31%) and raw material transportation (1%–18%). The methodologies used to assess delayed emissions in cradle-to-grave WBP GHG footprint assessments play an important role, especially for incineration scenarios. Finally, emission reduction measures are proposed based on reducing the consumption of adhesives and of energy use in the production process.",,,

In response to this gap, this study constructs and gauges the carbon footprint pressure (CFP) index of the Yangtze River Delta region over the period 2000–2020. Moreover, a comprehensive approach combining a modified gravity model, social network analysis, and the STIRPAT model is employed to systematically explore the evolution characteristics and effects of spatial correlations of CFP. The results show that the overall CFP predominantly displayed an oscillatory uptrend, underscored by stark spatial non-uniformity and an annually exacerbating divergence. The CFP exhibited a complex network structure, with continually intensifying stability and incremental convergence in its hierarchical framework. Nevertheless, the core-periphery attributes within this network remained pronounced, despite the low degree of network connectivity. Furthermore, the network incorporated four dynamically transmuting blocks. With the variable extent of the block's deconstruction and restructuring, the “club” spatial dispersion characteristic became increasingly evident. The degree centrality and betweenness centrality of urban nodes rendered an adverse impact on CFP, with the latter wielding a more potent effect.",,,

A process-based carbon footprint of hospital waste was estimated in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Accounting Sector Guidance for Pharmaceutical Products and Medical Devices, using activity data based on waste streams found at three hospitals in one UK National Health Service organisation. This study estimates that the carbon footprint per t of hospital waste was lowest when it is recycled (21–65 kg CO2e), followed by low temperature incineration with energy from waste (172–249 kg CO2e). When the waste was additionally decontaminated using an autoclave prior to low temperature incineration with energy from waste, the carbon footprint was increased to 569 kg CO2e. The highest carbon footprint was associated with the disposal of waste via high temperature incineration (1074 kg CO2e/ t). NHS data show that the financial cost of waste streams mirror that of the carbon footprint. In conclusion, it is possible to use the carbon footprint of hospital waste streams to derive emission factors for specific waste disposal options.

They are low-carbon since food items are selected on the basis of their lifecycle carbon footprint (CF). Eventually, the regionality constraints are relaxed to develop a World's low-carbon diet. For every area, we found a diet that halves the food-related CF. Instead, our World's low-carbon diet reduces the average food-related CF by 75%.

The main purpose of this research is to show the impact of climate change on maize yields and carbon footprint (CF) in South Korea over 10 years, find the proper operating method and promote the advanced combination of inputs for the sustainable development of maize farmers. Design/methodology/approach This study used survey data from the South Korea Rural Development Administration of 2010, 2014 and 2019 to estimate the CF of maize planting under intensive subsistence cultivation. Life-cycle assessment was used to determine the CF. Farmers were grouped according to significant differences in yield and GHG emissions. Linear regression was used to measure the dependence of the main contributors on the CF production and carbon efficiency. Findings In South Korean maize planting, N in chemical fertiliser was the most significant contributor to the CF and organic fertiliser was the most significant input. The use of chemical and organic fertilisers significantly affects the production of the CF and carbon efficiency. Households in the high-yield and low-GHG emission groups are more sustainable because they generate the least GHG when producing and earning through maize cultivation.

The evaluation was based on nutrient digestibility, rumen metabolism and total carbon footprint (CF). Carbon footprint included enteric methane emission and CF from feed production, transportation, processing, and C sequestration in the soil, based on a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach. Four diets varying in proportions of grass-clover silage and maize silage (100:0, 67:33, 33:67, and 0:100 on dry matter (DM) basis, respectively) were fed ad libitum to 4 lactating Holstein cows (a fifth cow was involved later in the study) fitted with ruminal, duodenal, and ileal canulae in a 4 × 4 Latin square design. Nutrient digestibility was measured using chromium oxide and titanium oxide as flow markers, and methane and CO2 emissions were measured in open-circuit respiration chambers on 5 consecutive days for each cow in each period. Data were analyzed with treatment and period as fixed effects and cow as random effect. DM intake (DMI) increased linearly (P = 0.01) with increased proportion of maize silage in the feed ration. Under the conditions in the present study, diets had only minor effects on digestibility of nutrients and there was no influence on rumen pH. Total VFA concentration decreased linearly with increased level of maize silage, but there were only minor effects on molar proportions of VFAs in the rumen. However, there was a linear increase in duodenal flow of microbial DM with increasing level of maize silage. The cows produced 30.7, 29.4. 28.4, and 26.2 L of methane/kg of DMI on diets 100:0, 66:33, 33:66, and 0:100, respectively (P = 0.02 for linear effect), which is equivalent to a 15% decrease, when all grass-clover silage was replaced by maize silage. Despite the significant reduction in enteric methane emission with increased proportion of maize silage, only a 4% decrease in total CF per kg DMI was found, when including CF from feed production, transportation, processing, manure, energy use and C sequestration in the soil, when using a LCA approach. If direct Land Use Change (LUC) or indirect LUC was included in estimation of CF, the reduction in CF when replacing all grass-clover silage was also 4–6%. However, the total CF was highly dependent on assumptions related to yield of grass-clover and maize.",,,

As a result, it is critical to quantify a household's carbon footprint in order to reduce it over time. One of the best ways to measure carbon emitted from various sectors of the economy, including household daily activities, is to calculate a country's carbon footprint (CF). This study statistically examined the magnitude of households' carbon footprints and their relationships with household daily activities and certain socio-economic demographic variables in Malaysia. Results revealed that the average household carbon footprint amounted to 11.76 t-CO2. The average also showed that the primary carbon footprint, 7.02 t-CO2 or 59.69% was higher compared to the secondary carbon footprint which was 4.73 t- CO2 or 40.22% and assessment revealed significant differences among household types. The largest carbon footprint was evident in a medium-high cost urban area, estimated at 20.14 t-CO2, while the carbon footprint found in a rural area was 9.58 t-CO2. In the latter, the primary carbon footprint was almost double the figure of 5.84 t-CO2 (61%) than the secondary carbon footprint of 3.73 t-CO2 (39%). The study reveals a higher carbon footprint in urban areas compared to rural ones depicting the effects of urbanisation and urban sprawl on household lifestyles and carbon footprints. Despite some limitations, the findings of this study will help policymakers design and implement stronger policies that enforce low-carbon activities and energy-saving goods and services in order to reduce urban Malaysia's carbon footprint dramatically.",,,

The material footprint is directly linked to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)-8 and 12. The main reason for the material footprint is the usage of fossil fuels, and the dependence of OECD countries on fossil fuels continues to this day. By expanding renewable energy utilization due to rising energy security risk, a community can take steps to improve ecological quality and reduce its material footprint. In this context, the paper focuses to examine the impact of energy security, green innovation, economic policy stringency and income on the fossil fuel material footprint for 24 OECD countries over the period 1995–2018. To this end, the paper uses the Augmented Mean Group (AMG) method and novel Half Panel Jackknife (HPJ) causality and estimation approach. The study adds value to existing knowledge by empirically testing the determinants of fossil fuel material footprint for OECD countries for the first time using the novel HPJ approach. The results of the AMG show that increasing energy security risk index reduces the material footprint, while green innovation and economic policy stringency have no impact on environmental degradation. The environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) in the form of an inverted U and an inverted N are valid for OECD countries. The HPJ approach also illustrates that there is a causality from green innovation and energy security risk to material footprint, and innovation and risk are support footprint reduction. Based on these results, the study recommends that OECD policymakers pay attention to ensuring energy security to reduce the material footprint by expanding renewable resources and allocate more economic resources to green innovations with higher returns, considering the validity of the EKC.",,,

Using partial and semipartial correlation analyses and Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) approach for the first time, the research identifies key variables affecting ecological footprint. Using Bayesian methods, posterior inclusion probabilities (PIPs) were calculated for each variable's coefficient estimates, revealing their relative importance. Biocapacity, energy consumption, industrialization, financial development, life expectancy, and globalization displayed notably high PIPs, indicating their strong influence on the ecological footprint. In addition, the study employs cointegration tests to examine the long-run relationship between ecological footprint and explanatory variables. The results indicate significant cointegration between these variables across panels, supported by various test statistics. In the Weighted Pooled DOLS estimation, biocapacity, energy consumption, and life expectancy significantly influence the ecological footprint, while industrialization, financial development, and globalization exert a comparatively smaller impact. Researchers and policymakers should consider these determinants for effective sustainable development planning. These findings underscore the intricate interplay of factors shaping the ecological footprint and offer insights for effective policy interventions towards sustainable development.",,,

In light of this, breeding cattle resilient to changes in feeding regimens is increasingly becoming an important topic. Body reserves can play a crucial role when feed resources are limited. We simulated populations of dairy cows selected with 2 different breeding goals: one reflecting the current breeding goal and the other placing weight on minimum level of body reserves in early lactation and change in body reserves during lactation. We considered this latter as a breeding goal for resilience. We used the 2 dynamic simulation programs ADAM and AQAL to predict performance of the cows after selection. In AQAL, we modeled moderate and severe drought by decreasing feed quality and quantity offered to cows during one year. We compared cows selected with the 2 breeding goals under 3 environments: without disturbances related to climate and with moderate and severe drought. In the environments without disturbances and the moderate drought, the cows selected with the current breeding goal had higher lifetime lactation efficiency (energy invested in milk/energy acquired from feed) and lower carbon footprint per kilogram of protein in milk and meat than cows selected for resilience. However, with severe drought, cows selected for resilience had higher lifetime lactation efficiency and lower carbon footprint per kilogram of protein in milk and meat than those selected with the current breeding goal. This suggests that cows selected for high productive performance do not perform well under very limiting conditions, leading to increased climate impact. The importance of inclusion of body reserves as a resilience trait in dairy cattle breeding depends on the future environment in which the cows will be used.",12,8968,

This paper proposes a simplified methodology for estimating the Carbon Footprint associated with heat generation by forest woodchips. The methodology includes all the relevant life cycle phases and is based on the specific fuel and plant characteristics, so it can effectively support sustainability assessment in decision-making regarding biomass projects through proper Carbon Footprint estimates. The application of the methodology showed results in the range of about 6–12 gCO2eq/MJ, depending on the case study characteristics, that agree with the impact values range observed from previous literature. The basic idea that the use of forest woodchips is particularly strategic for sustainable energy production within a “local” wood-energy supply chain (short transport distance) was confirmed. Furthermore, the methodology allowed to estimate indicative transportation distances for which forest woodchips can be considered environmentally competitive compared to alternative renewable sources such as, for instance, wood pellets.",,,

The consumption-based material footprint is trade-adjusted domestic resource consumption that presents an accurate picture of the domestic material footprint. Pursuing the same, this study draws asymmetric linkages between infrastructure development, green innovation, and consumption-based material footprint (MF) in the top 11 highly material-consuming countries. Our preliminary findings strictly reject the preposition of data normality and highlight that the observed relationship is quantile-dependent, which may disclose misleading results in previous studies using linear methodologies. In compliance, a novel empirical estimation technique popularized as Method of Moments Quantile Regression is employed that simultaneously deal with non-normality and structural changes in data. The results exhibit that infrastructure development (green innovation) significantly increases (decreases) MF mainly across medium to higher quantiles (medium-higher level of MF). Interestingly, the resource-depleting effect of infrastructure is highest for higher quantiles and lowest for lower quantiles of MF. Economic growth (globalization) increase MF, and their resource-depleting effect is higher (lowest) for lower quantiles and lowest (highest) for higher quantiles. Lastly, population exhibits an inverted-U shape relationship with MF across lower to higher quantiles. These results suggest pertinent policy recommendations.",,,

However, such evaluation is challenging due to varying technology readiness levels (TRL) of pathways, unavailability of cost and emission data for new technologies and uncertainty of performance parameters of lab scale technologies. In this study, we propose a standardized methodology that allow comparing synthetic fuel production pathways based on early stage lab scale CO2 electrolysis technologies with mature CCU technologies and incumbent technologies. This methodology provides guidelines for defining pathways, modeling and cost and carbon footprint (CF) assessment supported by a bottom-up framework to scale- up the costs and CF of lab scale technologies. We apply the developed methodology to evaluate Fischer-Tropsh synthesis (FTS) fuel production pathways based on bicarbonate electrolysis, a novel early stage CO2 electroreduction technology with integrated CO2 capture, and reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction, a mature thermocatalytic CO2 conversion technology. The cost of diesel fuel production using RWGS and bicarbonate electrolysis pathways were 1.7 $/L and 1.5 $/L, respectively, which is more than 140% of current cost of diesel. Nevertheless, both pathways were able to achieve significant emissions reductions with bicarbonate electrolysis reducing 90% and RWGS reducing at 70% compared to conventional diesel. Based on the uncertainties of calculated cost, neither pathway is more economically competitive than the other. However bicarbonate electrolysis pathway offer more opportunities for emission reduction as most of its energy demand can be provided by renewable electricity. RWGS pathway with relatively higher thermal energy demand will need to rely on high level of energy recovery and integration to achieve similar emission reductions.",,,

Objective To investigate the reduction in CF for patients utilizing telemedicine. Evidence acquisition The PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were queried for studies describing telemedicine consultation and reporting on carbon emissions saved and the carbon emissions of telemedicine devices as primary outcomes, and travel distance and time and cost savings and safety as secondary outcomes. Outcomes were tabulated and calculated per consultation. Carbon emissions and travel distances were also calculated for each total study cohort. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale, and the Oxford level of evidence was determined. Evidence synthesis A total of 48 studies met the inclusion criteria, covering 68 465 481 telemedicine consultations and savings of 691 825 tons of CO2 emissions and 3 318 464 047 km of travel distance. Carbon assessment was mostly reported as the estimated distance saved using a conversion factor. Medical specialties used telemedicine to connect specialists with patients at home (n = 25) or at a local center (n = 6). Surgical specialties used telemedicine for virtual preoperative assessment (n = 9), follow-up (n = 4), and general consultation (n = 4). The savings per consultation were 21.9–632.17 min and $1.85–$325. More studies focused on the COVID-19 time frame (n = 33) than before the pandemic (n = 15). The studies are limited by calculations, mostly for the travel distance for carbon savings, and appropriate follow-up to analyze the real impact on travel and appointments. Conclusions Telemedicine reduces the CF of the health care sector. Expanding the use of telemedicine and educating providers and patients could further decrease CO2 emissions and save both money and time. Patient summary We reviewed 48 studies on the use of telemedicine. We found that people used their cars less and saved time and money, as well as CO2 emissions, if they used teleconsultations. Some studies only looked at how much CO2 from driving was saved, so there might be more to learn about the benefits of teleconsultations. The use of online doctor appointments is not only good for our planet but also helps patients in saving time and money.

This emission leaves a carbon footprint (CF) that contributes to global warming. Reduction of CF is critical at all food processing steps to support sustainable development goals (SDGs). Generally, the new trend of low-CF food has influenced various aspects, including environmental, economic, and policy aspects. Scope and approach The purpose of this work was to explore CF in food processing, focusing on nonthermal technologies for reducing CF, including high-pressure procedures (HPP), pulse electric fields (PEF), cold plasma, low-energy electron beams (LEEB), and another emerging technology that has the potential to reduce CF. Key finding Our findings indicate that nonthermal technology applications can reduce heat usage but cannot reduce CF because they are influenced by the quantity of energy required for operations and the type of energy source used. Some emerging technologies, apart from reducing heat usage, can also reduce energy use in food processes, and enhance the efficiency of the food process or improves the shelf life and quality of food, reduces waste, and reduces the CF of each product. This review provides an overview of the prospects of nonthermal method applications in the food industry and policies to produce environmentally friendly food production. The implementation of new technology to minimize CF is expected to provide a viable alternative for the food industry, although its application requires process optimization for efficient food processing with good nutritional, sensory, and shelf-life qualities.",,,

The carbon footprint of PPP-LSF was 267 kg CO2-eq Mg−1, which was 32.7% and 38.2% lower than that of LSF and SHF, respectively. A new causal factor analysis developed in this study revealed that the mechanised application of controlled-release formula fertilisers, eliminating top-dressing, was the main factor for low carbon footprint in PPP-LSF. The mean net ecosystem carbon budget (NECB), sustainability index, and net ecosystem economic benefit of PPP-LSF were 22.5 Mg C ha−1, 17.1 and 2040 $ ha−1, respectively, which were increased by 15.3% and 23.9%, 55.5% and 69.3%, and 28.7% and 50.3% compared with LSF and SHF. Higher net primary productivity related soil carbon sequestration potential and lower field carbon emissions were the main drivers of high NCEB of PPP-LSF. This real-world commercial crop production-based example illustrates the value and potential of PPP-LSF in utilising modern innovative farming technologies and management strategies to accelerate agricultural productivity and resources conservation with reduced environmental footprints.",,,

This study analyzes the effects of such a ban on the carbon footprints of passenger car travel in Sweden using a novel vehicle turnover model and prospective lifecycle assessment, with scenarios for decarbonization of supply chains. A ban on internal combustion engines results in significantly decreased carbon footprints primarily due to reduced tailpipe CO2 emissions. The full effect of a ban is delayed due to fleet inertia. Increasing the pace of electrification is beneficial for the carbon footprint regardless of global manufacturing decarbonization pathways. A ban in 2030 is not sufficient to reach national policy targets for the transport sector, requiring either an earlier ban (i.e., 2025) or increased biofuel use. Risks of carbon leakage may motivate extending current regulations of vehicle-specific tailpipe emissions to also cover carbon footprints for new cars.",,,

Corporate GHG footprints, proxying for transition risk, are dominated by carbon emissions from energy use. Thus the growing attention on the carbon emissions of corporations from, principally, their energy use, motivates firms to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy. However, only a subset of corporations disclose their GHG/carbon footprints. This paper uses machine learning to improve the prediction of corporate carbon emissions for risk analyses by investors. We introduce a two-step framework that applies a Meta-Elastic Net learner to combine predictions from multiple base-learners as the best emission prediction approach. It results in an accuracy gain based on mean absolute error of up to 30% as compared with the existing models. We also find that prediction accuracy can be further improved by incorporating additional predictors (energy production/consumption data) and additional firm disclosures in particular sectors and regions. This provides an indication of where policymakers should concentrate their efforts for greater level of disclosure.",,,

The Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) has been investigated in a number of nations. However, the empirical research concentrating on evaluating two different environmental proxies for ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian) countries has not been done earlier. Furthermore, the majority of studies considered first-generation econometric approaches since they fail to account for cross-sectional dependency in their estimation. For this intention, the study used the second generation: CADF and CIPS unit root tests, Westerlund cointegration test, fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS) and Pooled Mean Group (PMG) to reinvestigate the EKC hypothesis in ASEAN nations between 1991 and 2016, examining two EKC specifications and comparing the validity of the EKC for consumption-based emissions (CO2 emission) and footprint-based emissions (ecological footprint). The empirical findings indicate that: (i) when using the EF, ‘the inverted U-shaped hypothesis’ is valid in ASEAN; on the contrary, when using the CO2 emissions, the ‘inverted U-shaped hypothesis’ is not valid in these countries; (ii) Non-renewable energy (NREC) has a significantly positive effect on EF and CO2 emissions whereas renewable energy consumption (REC) decreases environmental pollution in these countries; (iii) Unidirectional causality is reported between economic growth and environmental degradation while a bidirectional relationship is found between NREC and EF. A Significant policy recommendation is highlighted for ASEAN countries to encourage the consumption of renewable energy to lower CO2 emissions in the future and more efforts are needed to maintain the environmental sustainability.",,,

These differences influence production costs, market price and environmental impact. The most extensive system of fattening Iberian pigs is based on foraging acorns in a silvopastoral system named dehesa, and consumers usually associate the Iberian pork with this system, although nowadays more intensive systems are dominant due to their productivity and management simplicity. The aim of this study is to assess the Carbon Footprint (CF) of the different Iberian pig production systems using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. This study is based on data collected from 19 Iberian pig farms producing nursery growers (≤25 kg, 2 farms), pre-finished pigs (100–110 kg, 3 farms) and 3 types of finished pigs (150–175 kg), including free-range fattened pigs (17 farms), outdoor intensively fattened pigs (2 farms) and indoor intensively fattened pigs (2 farms). The CF was calculated with a “cradle to farm gate” approach using the kg of live weight (kgLW) as functional unit, and including C sequestration in soils and biomass, which was calculated by field monitoring in a selection of measuring points. The average CFs of the final products were 9.2 ± 2.5 kg CO2eq kgLW−1 for nursery growers, 5.6 ± 2.42 kg CO2eq kgLW−1 for pre-finished pigs, −5.6 ± 6.5 kg CO2eq kgLW−1 for free-range fattened pigs, 3.1 ± 1.5 kg CO2eq kgLW−1 for outdoor intensively fattened pigs and 7.7 ± 0.3 kg CO2eq kgLW−1 for intensively fattened pigs. The main C sinks of the dehesa system (trees and soil) sequestered an average of 3.18 t CO2eq ha−1 year−1. This C sequestration, averaging −10.2 ± 6.7 kg CO2eq kgLW−1 in free-range pig production, offsets 223% of the GHG emissions in those systems, which resulted in a negative CF (net CO2 sequestration). There was a direct relationship between CF and pig stocking rate, leading to strongly negative CF values on those farms with the lowest pig stocking rates.",,,

However, it remains to be verified how non-farm employment impact food structure, nutrition levels and environmental impact, especially the relationship between sustainability dimension and diet quality improvement needs to be explored. Based on the food consumption data of 996 rural households in China in 2019, the impact of non-farm employment on household food consumption, structure, nutrition levels, and carbon footprint was estimated. It was found that the dietary nutrition structure in rural areas of China is still unbalanced, with ample room for improvement. Non-farm employment will accelerate the adjustment of family dietary structure and the improvement of nutrition level, especially for low-income families. Meanwhile, it will not cause significant increase of food-related carbon footprint. Promotion of rural households’ non-farm employment and publicity health and nutrition knowledge are important ways to strengthen food structure and nutrition promotion.",,,

The results showed that during the period of 1990–2015, the carbon emissions of agriculture and animal husbandry on the QTP increased by 163% and 41%, respectively. Agricultural carbon sequestration showed an increasing trend with a growth rate of 45%, and animal husbandry carbon sequestration showed that it increased by 40% in the period of 1990–2005 and then decreased by 28% in the period of 2005–2015.

The high carbon emission regions of animal husbandry were located in southeastern areas, while the high carbon sequestration regions were in the southeastern, southwestern and middle areas. Additionally, the high carbon footprint regions were in southwestern areas. All measures mentioned showed a significant variation in spatial distribution. The economic and population growth contributed to the increase in carbon footprint despite technological advances.

We distinguish between local, EU-based, and rest-of-the-world (RoW) emissions and study how various approaches to CO2e taxation would affect households with different incomes. Finally, we compare the implications of taxing direct domestic emissions only versus taxing the carbon footprint and find socio-demographic factors that explain why some households have higher tax-to-income ratios. Socially balanced carbon mitigation policies should focus on these emitters as they might be particularly exposed to CO2e taxation.",,,

This study provides quantitative information about the surface contribution to enhancement of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration at Anmyeon-do (AMY), South Korea, using Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT) model and anthropogenic CO2 emission data. CO2 enhancement simulated by the STILT and emission data was positively correlated with measured CO2 anomalies at AMY with a correlation coefficient above 0.5. High and low CO2 days were selected using ground measurements of the CO2 mixing ratio at AMY during the winter season of 2018–2019. The surface contributions for the high and low CO2 days at AMY were compared quantitatively. When the high concentration was observed in AMY, the CO2 enhancements were dominated by domestic regions, especially from the metropolitan area in South Korea, due to the high footprint and large CO2 emissions. From the perspective of foreign regions, the surface contribution of eastern China regions (Shandong, Jiangsu-Shanghai) increased during high CO2 days compared to low CO2 days at AMY. During the high CO2 days, the ratio between CO2 and carbon monoxide, a co-emitted species, is large when the surface contribution of eastern China regions is relatively strong due to different regional combustion efficiency (i.e., high combustion efficiency in South Korea compared to that in China). The surface contribution based on STILT and emission data is useful for understanding the cause of high GHG concentration at the receptor (AMY in this study).",,,

Despite broad interest in energy consumption and CO2 emissions generated by steel production, there are few impact-oriented Water Footprint (WF) assessments of steel production. This study evaluates the water, carbon and fossil energy footprints generated from rolled steel production on the basis of life cycle assessment. Key contributors attributing to those environmental impacts are also identified so as to explore their potential mitigation. Using the Monte Carlo model, an uncertainty analysis is conducted with the aim of providing reliable results for decision-making. Results show that the impact per ton China’s rolled steel production has on global warming, human health, ecosystem quality, and resources is 4.40 × 103 kg CO2 eq (GSD2 = 1.24), 4.15 × 10-3 Disability Adjusted of Life Years (DALY) (GSD2 = 1.31), 7.08 × 10-5 Species·yr (GSD2 = 2.04), and 4.39 × 104 MJ (GSD2 = 1.28), respectively. Global warming and freshwater ecotoxicity is the dominant contributor to the damage impact on human health and ecosystem quality, respectively. Results also show that the transport (freight ship) of raw materials and the production of iron powder are the two main contributors to the overall impact on the environment that rolled steel production has. Several policy recommendations are proposed in this paper, which focus on adjusting the steel industry’s industrial structure, promoting the national-level carbon emissions trading in the ISI, promoting international cooperation, and improving public awareness of green and low-carbon development. Such policy recommendations provide decision-makers with valuable insights, which thus allow them to prepare the appropriate mitigation policies.",,,

The survey respondents were segregated into four European regions based on their nationality viz. Nordic, Baltic, and Eastern Europe (NBE), Central and South-eastern Europe (CSE), Western and southern Europe (WSE), and North-western Europe (NWE). The WDC are represented by four index categories viz. low willing, moderate willing, willing, and highly willing. The WDC indicators such as housing, food, energy, waste and transport were used to identify the trend and correlation, gender-specific density distribution, and overall regional comparison analysis. The trend and correlation analysis between energy vs. transport, waste vs. food, and a separate state of housing represented the current global carbon emission situation, where four overlapping clusters indicated the respondent's closest or similar selection at their consumption level. The gender-specific density suggests that the male respondent's average WDC for housing and food index ranges from moderate to highly willing. In contrast, the female average WDC for food, waste, energy and transport index ranges from moderate willing to willing and bimodal for other scenarios. Among the regional comparisons, NBE in housing (moderate willing to willing), CSE in food (willing to highly willing), WSE and CSE in energy and all the regions in waste management (willing to highly willing) presented better indices. In transport, Europe as a whole exhibits poor index. In case of WDC index, the regional comparison indicates that the CSE region exhibited better outcomes than the other regions, except for housing.

We examined the role of tourists' holiday preferences in shaping the carbon footprint of leisure travel within the EU by calculating demand and impact indicators associated with eight holiday styles. We find a substantial and equivalent carbon footprint for visiting relatives, nature tourism and sea, sun and sand tourism, but a higher carbon intensity of travel per trip for the latter. This is due to widespread demand for sea, sun, and sand tourism despite the concentration of destinations in Southern Europe. Furthermore, international travel within the EU is on average three times more carbon intensive than domestic travel.

The focus has been on achieving environmental footprint neutrality through the application of green technologies (GT) and financial development (FD) in facilitating this transition. To determine the contribution of these variables to sustainability, this study investigated the effects of GT and FD on EF in Algeria from Q1/1990 to Q4/2021. Additionally, this research examines the moderating role of GT with FD on EF. To achieve these objectives, advanced Fourier autoregressive distributed lag techniques and the Fourier causality test were employed. The findings reveal that FD increases EF, leading to ecological degradation. Conversely, GT reduces EF in the long run, demonstrating its potential to foster ecological sustainability. Notably, the study highlights the significant moderating role of GT in the FD-EF relationship. This underscores the critical role of environmental technologies in mitigating the adverse effects of FD by facilitating creative technologies and lowering EF. Therefore, the study recommends that Algeria integrates GT with FD to achieve long-term reduction of environmental harm. In conclusion, Algeria needs to hasten GT in combination with stronger FD to mitigate ecological impacts without compromising sustainable economic growth.",,,

To this end, we investigated corn and potato production data in the 2019–2020 crop years for 852 plots of 345 rural households in six villages (two irrigation agriculture pilot villages and four surrounding villages as controls) in Southwest China. The crop CFP in the irrigation agriculture pilot areas was significantly lower than in non-reform areas. Irrigation reforms mainly impacted the crop CFP through four intermediary effects: the project (implementation of field irrigation channels), technology (improving adoption of new irrigation technologies), management (proper irrigation operation and maintenance), and yield effects. All effects inhibited the CFP, except for the project effect that promotes carbon emissions. Among them, yield increase has the greatest impact on reducing CFP, followed by management and technology effects. Furthermore, planting practices, individual characteristics, and plot quality significantly impacted the crop CFP. This study has policy implications for understanding the food security–climate nexus in the food production industry.",4,1243,

Therefore, the evaluation of carbon security is imperative. This paper, using Yunnan as an example, built up models of carbon footprint and vegetation carbon carrying capacity to assess the level of carbon security. The IPCC method, which is internationally recognized and universal applied, was adopted to calculate carbon footprint. Forest, grassland and crop plant were selected to calculate carbon carrying capacity. The study relied on data from 2008 to 2017 for analysis and arrived at the conclusion that Yunnan's carbon footprint rose from 272.48 million tonnes in 2008 to 317.71 million tonnes in 2017. The result shows that the carbon carrying capacity of vegetation assumed an increasing trend from 339.52 million tonnes in 2008 to 416.30 million tonnes in 2017. The carbon pressure index was 0.80 in 2008 and 0.76 in 2017, showing a trend of first rising and then falling. This implies that Yunnan is carbon surplus and the level of carbon security is within the region of relatively safe. It is appropriate to improve upon the carbon carrying capacity and reduce the carbon footprint to maintain carbon security in the future.",,,

However, for wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), the carbon footprint of different treatment technologies and its contribution among various units within each treatment configuration is still unclear. This study evaluates the impacts of process design on the carbon footprint of WWTPs through the analysis of scope 1 (direct emission), scope 2 (indirect emission), and scope 3 (value chain emission) emissions. The comprehensive configuration design in this work considered three nutrient removal processes including typical aerobic and anaerobic wastewater treatment technologies. Emissions from the sludge management processes are also calculated, including aerobic and anaerobic sludge stabilization processes, short-term and long-term sludge storage, and three sludge disposal options. In total, 45 processes were analysed and the results were compared. The results showed the carbon footprints are highly dependent on the treatment configurations of WWTPs. Analysis suggested scope 2 & 3 emissions can be reduced by selecting suitable processes. In general, anaerobic wastewater and sludge stabilization technologies are more suitable than aerobic technologies to reduce scope 2 & 3 emissions, leading to a lower overall carbon footprint. In comparison, configuration design offers limited opportunities to reduce scope 1 emissions, which may be the future challenge for WWTP to achieve carbon neutrality.",,,

This calls for new strategies to change dietary habits, especially as many consumers are reluctant to eat less meat. This study tests the effect of labelling a meat-based ready meal with different levels of carbon footprint and healthiness on consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for these attributes. Participants took part in two sequential non-hypothetical discrete choice experiments (DCE). In the first experiment, they completed a DCE where the ready meals (i.e. beef lasagne) were labelled using a dual traffic light labelling system; one labelled for carbon footprint and one for healthiness. In the second experiment, participants repeated the DCE after they were told the carbon footprint and healthiness varied because of the meat and saturated fat content, respectively. The study found that participants were willing to pay a premium for the healthier lasagne and this did not change when they were given the information about saturated fat content. Participants were also willing to pay a premium for lasagne with a lower carbon footprint, but this decreased when they knew these meals contained less meat. Information about the meat content had the unintended consequence of discouraging people to buy lasagne with a low carbon footprint. The study provides an important insight for policy and industry into the effect of labelling information on consumers’ purchasing decisions at a time when people are being encouraged to eat less meat.",,,

This study assessed the carbon footprint (CF) of maize production under different agricultural management practices and scenarios based on a cradle-to-farm gate life cycle analysis and DNDC model, considering future climate impacts and clean energy use. Maintaining the current energy use strategy, under the management of residue removal, future climate change will lead to a 3.0% increase in the CF of maize, while in the residue returning system, the CF of maize will decrease by 40.9%. In the highly mechanized maize production system, the CF of maize was shown to be mainly determined by the CO2 equivalent emissions (CE) from upstream production and in-field portions, including soil emissions and the use of agricultural machinery. Residue return plays a critical role in establishing maize's CF, making maize fields a carbon sink. The use of clean energy can reduce the CF of maize by 482.9±8.6 kg CO2 eq ha−1.

Yet, how existing and newly-built assets contribute differently to the footprints of transportation infrastructures is not clear. In this paper, we develop a life-cycle approach to quantify the energy and carbon footprints of urban transportation infrastructures over time, with a clear differentiation between existing and newly-built assets. Taking Guangzhou, China as a case study, we evaluate the dynamic footprints of various types of urban transportation infrastructure (roads, subway, and railway) across their life-cycle stages until 2017, and perform a scenario analysis to 2035 to explore future pathways of footprint mitigation. We find that the energy and carbon footprints of road assets built prior to 2005 are around 36 times higher than those of the subway and 5 times higher than those of the railway. However, this situation has begun to shift over 2006–2017 as the subway and railway have become more popular means of transportation and bigger contributors to the city’s energy and carbon footprints. The pace of technological advances in building transportation infrastructure needs to exceed that of the average urban economy to steadily reduce the energy and carbon footprints of the new projects planned. These findings offer a dynamic life-cycle approach and tool to evaluate long-term regulatory policies toward a more sustainable transportation infrastructure system in cities.",,,

Prior investigations have chosen panel data methodologies to detect the association between industrial robots and ecological footprint. Nonetheless, these studies often overlooked the variations in this relationship across different countries. In contrast, this article choses the Quantile-on-Quantile approach to assess this relationship on a country-specific basis. This methodology offers a comprehensive global perspective while delivering tailored insights relevant to each nation. The findings suggest that industrial robots improve environmental quality by decreasing ecological footprint across different data quantiles in chosen nations. The findings also underline that the asymmetries between our variables differ from country to country.

In particular, it aims to investigate the potential greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction in terms of three different heating and ventilation options, and to analyze the influence of decarbonization of electricity production as well as the technological progress of the waste treatment of timber on the building's environmental performance. Thus, the whole life‑carbon of the building case studies was evaluated for a total of eight investigated prospective scenarios, and they were compared to the LCA results of the baseline scenario, where the existing technology and context remained constant over time. Results show that using a compact heat pump would lead to a significant whole life-cycle emission reduction of the dwelling, by 19 %; while GHG emission savings can be reinforced if the assessed systems are employed simultaneously with grid decarbonization, exhibiting a 25 %–60 % reduction compared to the baseline scenario. Moreover, technological changes in the waste treatments of timber products could substantially reduce the buildings' embodied emissions, representing 3 %–23 %. From these emission-saving measures, the contribution of material efficiency strategies to achieve more embodied carbon savings should be highlighted in future construction practices.",,,

In recognition of the negative environmental impacts of sport and event tourism, this study quantifies the carbon footprint of the 2019 National Collegiate Athletic Association Men's Basketball Tournament by considering the travel of fans and teams, food, waste, lodging, and stadium operations. The footprint is approximated at 210 million kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents. Broken down, this equates to about 500 kg per participant. Travel is responsible for nearly 80 percent of that total which underscores the positive relationship between distance traveled and greenhouse gasses emitted in tourism.

This will, in turn, allow for the democratization of sustainability models for industries and organizations to introspectively quantify their environmental impact as an initial assessment for internal purposes or comparison to outside audits. This study's results demonstrate the need to make mega sport-tourism events like March Madness more sustainable. However, this can only be done by tourism managers closing the environmental value-action gap that too often manifests as inaction.

This strategy is based on a novel Carbon Dioxide Utilization approach from a biogenic CO2 released by fermentation processes to produce a fully marketable and environmentally friendly chemical product at a global level, i.e., sodium carbonate. This paper presents the strategy development corresponding to a real case: a medium-size winery and distillery in Spain, where the “CO2-AFP Strategy” has been successfully tested and scaled-up. Detailed and tested carbon capture and utilization schemes are used to evaluate the overall carbon footprint balance (carbon calculation, capture potential, and carbon balance) via an improved hybrid multiregional input-output-lifecycle assessment model (MRIO-LCA). The benefits go beyond the reduction of carbon footprint in the fermentation industry. The application of the “CO2-AFP Strategy” implies a revolution, in terms of Circular Economy, in the sodium carbonate industry, as the symbiotic process between the different stages of the value chain will allow downstream carbon footprint reductions, facilitating a greener sodium carbonate production.",,,

In the context of Waste-Glass-UHPCC, the reduction in early strength, attributed to the varied pozzolanic reactivity of MS and recycled glass powder as cementitious materials, may reduce its application that requires high early strength. This study addresses the early strength deficiency of Waste-Glass-UHPCC by incorporating metakaolin (MK) and also aims to assess the impact of MK on 28-day compressive strength, durability, and carbon footprint. Research investigating the effects of MK on UHPCC with reduced OPC and MS content is currently limited. Specifically, this investigation explores the influence of MK on UHPCC characterized by a cement content of 620 kg/m3. By utilizing advanced statistical methods [i.e., the Central Composite Design (CCD) and Response Surface Methodology (RSM)], this study investigates the substitution of MK for OPC in formulations of Waste-Glass-UHPCC. The experimental design comprises 18 encoded mixtures, allowing for the development of second-order regression models for critical responses [slump flow and compressive strength at different ages]. Besides, visualization through RSM-3D graphs facilitates a comprehensive examination of the effects of various factors. For a deeper analysis, two of the CCD's points, i.e., SP-12 (Waste-Glass-UHPCC without metakaolin), and SP-10 (Waste-Glass-UHPCC with 65.77 kg of metakaolin per cubic meter) were further investigated along with a control dosage that represents a typical UHPCC formulation. The responses studied encompassed 1, 7, and 28 d compressive strength, chloride ion penetration, and carbon footprint measured by a systematic life cycle analysis (following ISO 15804), assessing the environmental impact of the UHPCC's making materials from raw extraction to disposal. Despite encountering challenges in meeting self-compacting concrete criteria due to MK's tendency to accelerate hydration, the enhanced early strength properties (61 % higher than those of the Waste-Glass-UHPCC) make the MK-based mixture appropriate for various applications such as bridge engineering or pavement rehabilitation. Additionally, the addition of MK in UHPCC formulation demonstrated superior resistance to chloride ion permeability even compared to the control mixture, attributed to MK's ability to enhance the concrete's microstructure and capture chloride ions, attributed to Friedel's salt formation. Noteworthy findings include a significant (27 %) reduction in carbon footprint with the incorporation of MK in Waste-Glass-UHPCC compared to the control counterparts. The current study highlights the durability and environmental advantages of MK-based UHPCC blends while emphasizing the critical requirements of workability and strength development of sustainable UHPCC.",,,

Understanding how cities obtain, distribute, and manage their carbon emissions could be an essential step for collaborative management of regional carbon emission reduction. In the present study, by compiling a nested multi-regional input-output table, an investigation was conducted into the city-level carbon footprints and inter-regional CO2 transfer embodied in the trade of finished goods at home and abroad for 29 cities in Central Plain urban agglomeration. The total carbon footprint of the urban agglomeration was found to be 1144.6 Mt, accounting for 10% of the national emissions, and significant differences were observed in the city-level carbon footprints, ranging from 3.2 Mt (Huaibei) to 176.3 Mt (Zhengzhou). The carbon footprint per capita also varied greatly, from Huaibei (1.4 t) to Jiyuan (20.7 t), and was significantly correlated with GDP per capita. CO2 emissions due to capital formation contributed the most to the carbon footprint, followed by urban consumption. Through the export of numerous industrial products to support infrastructure construction and economic activities, the urban agglomeration received 736.3 Mt net emissions from other regions at home and abroad. Significant embodied CO2 transfer was observed to drift from energy-abundant cities, such as Pingdingshan and Shangqiu, to richer cities, such as Zhengzhou and Luoyang. The inter-city CO2 flows were mainly shaped by heavy industry, construction and service sectors. Finally, targeted mitigation policy methods have been recommended for different types of cities from production and consumption perspectives.",,,

A potential dissonance exists, however, between this perception and the measured sustainability of their lifestyles. In global terms, they are highly affluent countries spreading their climate impact beyond their borders by importing a large share of the energy and resources used by their residents. In this research, we focus on the potential dissonance between the self-perceived climate-sustainability of the lifestyles in the Nordic countries and the actual consumption-based carbon footprints (CBCF), estimated through a survey-based CBCF calculator with ∼8000 respondents across Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland and Iceland. Using bivariate and regression analysis, the study found that across all levels of climate-sustainability perception the CBCF the respondents ranged from 6.3 to 11.3 tCO2-eq/capita, representing a significant difference (79%) between the highest emitting (very low perception) and lowest emitting groups (high perception). A general negative correlation between elevated levels of climate-sustainability perception and CBCF was found, predominantly in the areas of diet, vehicle possession, and consumption of goods and services. Intriguingly, a counterintuitive increase in CBCF at extremely high levels of climate-sustainability perception was seen. Additional factors that contribute to higher climate-sustainability perception are explored, such as age, climate literacy, and pro-climate attitude (PCA). Conversely, individuals with high incomes or belonging to households with children display lower levels of climate-sustainability perception. Across all perception groups, however, the results confront the perception of the Nordics as climate leaders as Nordic CBCFs were still far above the average CBCF for the lowest global 50% of Earth's population and were far above (∼2–4x) suggested 2030 targets to remain below 1.5 °C warming. The findings of this study serve as an invaluable resource for policymakers aiming to align public perception with effective sustainability measures, thereby assisting in reducing CBCF and achieving global climate goals.",,,

The objectives of this study are (1) to determine the annual raw cow milk CF in the Netherlands between 1990 and 2019 and (2) to identify the factors explaining the development of the raw cow milk CF over time. We applied Life Cycle Assessment (cradle to farm gate) to the average Dutch dairy system and used data collected from national statistics and from the farm accountancy data network. The CF of raw cow milk produced in the Netherlands in 2019 was 992 g CO2-eq. per kg Fat and Protein Corrected Milk (FPCM), while in 1990 it was 1522 g CO2-eq. (kg FPCM)−1. This represents a reduction of 35%. The reduction rate of the CF is affected by the scope of the CF study, i.e. reduction rate is smaller if direct land use change (dLUC) (32%) and soil organic carbon (SOC) balance (29%) are included in the total CF. Methodological choices affect the absolute level of the CF by up to 27%, but the impact on the reduction rate over time is negligible. The results show that continuous improvement in agricultural practices (increased milk and roughage yields, improved feed efficiency and decreased nitrogen application) has played an important role in reducing the CF of milk over the years. Along with this process, the Dutch dairy system has evolved into less grazing and less land devoted to permanent grasslands which decreased carbon sequestration. In order to achieve climate targets, the annual reduction rate needs to be increased and additional efforts are required if the Dutch dairy sector is to play its part in limiting global warming to 1.5 °C. Special attention is needed for the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission from enteric fermentation and manure storage. However, the main challenge for the future is to find a balanced set of measures to integrally reduce all the sources of GHG emission within the carbon footprint of milk.",,,

To improve the recycling of concrete debris, a powder compaction process for concrete waste was designed to obtain recycled compacted concrete (hereinafter referred to as compact) and thermal treatment was proposed to be utilized to improve its strength. However, non-specific investigations of treatment parameters, like-treatment temperature, and duration, do still exist, and the required high production pressure (100 MPa) is impracticable. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of two novel treatments on compact in improving its strength and reducing its carbon footprint. First, the heat treatment process used in a previous study [1] was expanded by varying immersion durations and treatment temperatures. Second, autoclaving was employed to obtain a stronger compact with different treatment settings. Additionally, in both treatment processes, the efficacy of low production pressure (<100 MPa) was evaluated. For this, eighteen different concrete wastes, having different industrial wastes, like-fly ash, slag, were collected, crushed, and powdered to produce compacts. The treated compacts were characterized based on both compressive strength and carbon footprint to compare the environmental performance of a compact prepared via thermal treatments in the production phase. The test results revealed that increasing water immersion duration (to 48 h) during the heat treatment process improved the compact strength to up to 48 MPa, and autoclaving at higher temperatures (at 220 °C) resulted in a compact strength of up to 98 MPa. Additionally, a strength of 30 MPa was attained even at a low production pressure (10 MPa) after autoclaving. The estimated CO2 emissions of the compact production process developed in this study were as low as 70.6 kg/m3 of compact. At the present stage of the study, it can be deduced that the compact manufactured possesses potential for implementation in various non-structural applications, including the production of pavement blocks and bricks, with lower CO2 emissions.",13,22231,

This study examines the critical impact of cleaner energy sources, advanced technology firms, and economic expansion on ecological footprints within the context of sustainable development, focusing on the period between 2010 and 2022. By comparing the E7 (emerging seven) and G7 (Group of Seven) economies, the research aims to delineate how these factors collectively influence environmental sustainability in both developing and developed nations. Utilizing a robust panel estimation technique, the study systematically explores the relationship between the adoption of renewable energy technologies, the growth of high-tech industries, and macroeconomic expansion, alongside their respective effects on the ecological footprint, a key indicator of environmental impact. Our statistical analysis reveals significant differences between the E7 and G7 countries. For the G7, investments in cleaner energy and technology sectors have shown a more pronounced effect in reducing ecological footprints, attributed to higher efficiency standards and greater public awareness. In contrast, the E7 countries exhibit a delayed response, owing to varying stages of economic development and technological adoption, although promising trends are emerging. Notably, the G7 demonstrates a more pronounced inclination towards financial imperialism (0.043), while the E7 is significantly influenced by green energy sources (0.258). Policy implications drawn from the findings suggest that targeted investments in green technologies and renewable energy sources, coupled with robust policies supporting economic expansion in a sustainable manner, are crucial for both groups of countries. For the E7, accelerating technology transfer and adopting stricter environmental regulations are key, while the G7 should focus on innovation and the continuous improvement of energy efficiency standards.

The ecological footprint (EF) is an important indicator of the sustainability of ecosystems, with carbon footprint (CF) and biocapacity (BC) being key indicators of forest ecosystems. Despite the high carbon sequestration capacity of mangrove ecosystems, they have not yet been included in EF. This study introduces mangrove ecosystems into EF accounting and assesses the eco-environmental benefits of mangrove conservation in China. To achieve this, the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of mangrove forests was estimated based on the gross primary production and respiration rates. Average forest carbon sequestration (AFCS) and yield factor, key parameters of CF and BC, were calculated from NEE for the first time. The CF and BC of mangrove ecosystems were then refined using newly defined AFCS and yield factor. The proposed framework was applied to the whole mangrove forests in China to assess mangrove conservation efforts. The results showed that the average CF of mangrove forests is about 1000 M ha, which is lower than that of terrestrial forests, while the BC of mangroves is not as high as expected due to the limited area of mangroves. CF and BC vary along the coastline, whereby CF tends to decrease with decreasing latitude while BC remains high at low latitudes owing to the large mangrove area. There is no significant decreasing trend in CF, but BC increases with increasing mangrove area. The newly introduced ecological footprint accounting of mangrove ecosystems suggests that mangrove conservation in China should focus on ecosystem health and expand the area of forestable land. These findings will benefit future management of mangrove ecosystems in China and other countries.",,,

However, the role and magnitude of restructurings in the energy sector and economy in decoupling were underestimated. In this context, China’s 30 provinces were selected as study areas. By employing a carbon footprint pressure (CFP) indicator to represent the imbalance, a widely decoupling method was adopted to describe the decoupling state and trend of CFP and economic growth. An extended IPAT equation and the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index method were further used to reveal the role and magnitude of drivers on decoupling. The findings revealed that the CFP climbed significantly in 26 provinces between 2006 and 2015. We discovered that 22 provinces were working toward absolute decoupling, with 15 provinces achieving it during the 12-th Five-Year Plan. Our analysis revealed that improving energy efficiency was the primary driver of absolute decoupling, while substituting natural gas and oil for coal, reducing industry share, and enhancing carbon sequestration accelerated absolute decoupling.

However, the countries heading for the hydrogen economy are usually unable to meet their demands with the inland supply alone due to infrastructure and economic problems caused by expensive resources and a shortage of land. In this kind of background, introducing overseas hydrogen which can be produced economically by utilizing unused resources and land overseas is regarded as an attractive way to meet demands. In this study, an economic as well as a carbon footprint analysis of overall hydrogen supply from overseas to inland for several hydrogen carriers, including liquid hydrogen, liquid organic hydrogen carriers, and ammonia, were conducted. For ship transportation sector, the cross-overs between unit hydrogen costs of liquid organic hydrogen carriers and liquid hydrogen could be found at around 4,000 km and 1 million tons of hydrogen in trends according to distance and amount, respectively. And for distribution sector, pipeline is significantly feasible due to the large amount while trailers show feasibility with hydrogen amount less than around 4,500 tons for delivery sector. A case study of importing hydrogen from Indonesia to Korea was conducted presenting feasibility with all unit hydrogen costs below the 2030 target as stipulated in the Korean roadmap as well as a guideline regarding which sector contributes majorly and should be improved technically and strategically to fulfill the 2040 target in the roadmap.

However, as critical as it is, this domain is insufficiently examined by researchers, and shows ambiguous results. Moreover, these studies do not address the role of technological innovation in shaping the ecological footprint, in an open and explicit manner. Therefore, realizing the need for a more critical evaluation of the intricacies involved in studying the ecological footprint, this study analyzes the linkages between natural resources, technological innovations, economic growth, and the resulting ecological footprint in emerging economies. Drawing on the data from 1984 to 2016, we employed the second-generation panel cointegration methodologies to study the findings of this research. Results of Pesaran's CD test and P&Y's slope homogeneity test confirm the existence of a slope heterogeneity across countries, and correlation amongst cross-sectional units. Moreover, Cointegration results confirm a stable, long-run relationship between the ecological footprint, natural resources, technological innovations, and economic growth. In the long run, natural resources and economic growth increase and expand the ecological footprint, while technological innovations are helpful in abating environmental degradation that takes place a result of this phenomenon. Furthermore, the quadric term for economic growth showed a negative impact on the ecological footprint, i.e., in the presence of the Environment Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. Additionally, the results from CS-ARDL were reconfirmed by utilizing the Augmented Mean Group (AMG) method. Also, the result of the Dumitrescu-Hurlin Granger causality test shows that any policy to target natural resources, technological innovations, and economic growth significantly alters the ecological footprint and vice versa. Our key findings lead towards the manifestation and emphasis of the importance of appropriate policies for restoring natural resources and at the same time, upgrading technological innovations in order to attain sustainable development goals.",,,

Inland transport, air transport, and water transport are the main three modes of moving people and goods in Hungary. Therefore, these three modes affect the environment by contributing a significant amount of carbon and energy footprint. In the literature, there is no such study that identifies the environmental impacts of the Hungarian transport sector. Therefore, the lifecycle-based carbon and energy footprint impacts of Hungarian transport practices were assessed in this study, which took into account international trading links with the rest of the world. The Hungarian economy was modeled as part of a multi-region input-output (MRIO) life cycle evaluation system, which included 40 major economies, including the Hungarian, United States, China, Russia, and others and the rest of the world (ROW) nations. According to the WIOD database definition, each country's economy comprises 35 major industries. The global system of the world economy is equalized by a total of 1435 sectors (41 × 35 = 1435). The method is unique in that the MRIO model was constructed in a stochastic manner, taking into account global trade-related uncertainties. Using data mining and predictive simulation methods, the investigation focused on top carbon-emitting and energy-consuming sectors and countries. The outcome illustrated that Hungary has the highest overall carbon footprint (CFP) and total energy footprint (EFP) contributions, respectively, with 59.94% and 45.18%. Furthermore, the inland transportation market and electricity, gas, and water supply were found to be the most dominant industries in terms of overall CFP, accounting for 46.32% and 18.35%, respectively. With 34.64% of the overall effects, the coke/refined petroleum/nuclear fuel market has the highest proportion of the total energy footprint. The transportation sector has a significant role in the Hungarian economy because of the unique geographic location of the country. In another word, road and train modes are considered the dominant mode of moving goods in Hungary. Therefore, the inland transportation market is the highest contributor sector to the total share of CFP and ranked second in sharing the EFP.",,,

As a result, industries have been forced to consider investing significantly in supply chains to achieve an efficient distribution of LNG for cost efficiency and carbon footprint reduction. To minimize the contribution of LNG maritime transportation to global climate change, there is a need to quantify the carbon footprints systematically. In this research, we developed a novel and practical model for estimating the carbon footprint for LNG maritime transport. Using the MATLAB program, an uncertainty-based carbon footprint accounting framework is created. The Monte Carlo simulation model is built to conduct a carbon footprint analysis while the main input parameters were changed within a reliable range. Later, a multivariate sensitivity analysis is performed using the Risk Solver software to estimate the most significant parameters on the net carbon footprints. The sensitivity analysis results showed that that steam process day and steaming fuel consumption are found to be the most sensitive parameters for the overall carbon footprint for both Laden and Ballast trips. Furthermore, it was found that the Q-Max vessel produces more carbon emissions when compared to the Q-Flex, although both are traveling the same distance and are using the same fuel type. The type of fuel is also significantly affecting the emission values due to the relevant carbon content in the fuel. Like the case of the two conventional vessels, the one that is running with the only LNG is found to have fewer emissions when compared to the one run with dual-mode.",,1613,

However, this requires a detailed demand model, which is often not available in the early planning stages. To address this need, this paper proposes a novel methodology for building a demand model using available information, including types of zones/sectors present on-site, historical energy consumption of those sectors at a national level, and energy consumption studies on floor-stock basis (i.e., floor area). We apply this approach in a case study energizing the proposed Aerotropolis Core Precinct (ACP) within the wider Aerotropolis site to be constructed in Western Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The model also looks at supplying this demand, and the corresponding associated emissions, for the years 2025, 2035 and 2050 – in line with Australia’s Net Zero-time horizon. Results show that ACP demand increases from 368 GWh in 2025 to 1,233 GWh in 2035 then 1,444 GWh in 2050, as is expected moving from partial to full operation and accounting for temperature-dependent demand fluctuations. Electrical demand is 62% of total demand, while thermal is 38%. Generated supply is estimated to increase from 221 MW (2025) to 866 MW (2035) and 1,077 MW (2050), accounting for capacity factors. Emissions associated with that demand will change from 185 ktCO2eq to 229 ktCO2eq then decrease to 201 ktCO2eq due to an increasingly “greener” technology mix predicted (i.e., no use of coal due to shutdowns of coal-fired power plants, and very little gas use by 2050). These methods and estimates provide a decision-making basis for government policy-making, energy planning, and technology supply for greenfield sites, as well as provide a platform to invite stakeholder engagement.",,,

Methane production was determined by means of biochemical methane potential tests. For co-digestion, the highest increase in methane production (53.8 %) was observed for the SS:OFMSW mixing ratio 40:60. Hydrodynamic disintegration at all tested energy densities (10, 30 and 60 kJ/L) caused release of soluble organic compounds from both substrates, although accelerated methane production was only observed at 10 kJ/L. An increase in methane potential for substrates disintegrated separately did not imply analogical results for the disintegration of their mixture. Within the assumed limits, CF per 1 Nm3 of produced methane, CF per 1 t of wet feedstock for the digester, and estimated CF per 1 kWh produced were also calculated. Comparable values of all indicators were obtained for monodigestion and co-digestion. The highest CF indices were achieved for monodigestion of disintegrated SS and increased significantly with applied energy density. The obtained results can serve as valuable material for operators of wastewater treatment plants facilitating the selection of sustainable methods of increasing renewable energy production.",,,

Additionally, we examine the moderating role of FE in the relationship between RE and CCE. This study employs the method of moment quantile regression to demonstrate that an increase in RE and more strict ER substantially reduces CCE. Similarly, FE has a significant inverse effect on environmental degradation. Further, we observe that as RE increases, FE plays a crucial moderating role, reinforcing the inverse relationship with CCE. In the context of the COP28 summit, this study recommends that policymakers integrate renewable energy strategies with financial restructuring to facilitate sustainable economic growth amidst climate change.",,1495,

To address this challenge, effective strategies are needed to protect soil resources without compromising crop yields. Currently, there are three main players involved: scientists, policymakers, and land managers. However, the technical knowledge required to understand how soil erosion affects food production hinders the communication of the potential benefits of soil sustainability strategies to nontechnical stakeholders, such as farmers and food producers. Moreover, a major player in this fight is still missing, consumers. If there is no connection between soil and society then the soil itself may not be valued and it is less likely to be managed sustainably. In this study, we propose the concept of soil footprint, defined as the ratio of soil loss to crop yield, to communicate, quantify, and compare soil security for different crops. It is a versatile concept that can be applied for a multitude of potential practical uses. To showcase some of these potential uses, we used national data to calculate the soil footprint of the ten main crops in Spain. We demonstrate the utility of this metric to compare and rank crops, identify problematic regions, and assess the effect of land management on the soil footprint. The soil footprint indicator offers advantages in terms of simplicity, facilitating easy calculation, comparison, and interpretation by non-technical users. This can engage society in soil conservation, empower land managers to define sustainable soil management strategies, and promote policies to enhance soil security.",,,

Given the complexity of quantifying total lifecycle emissions in residential buildings, this study delves into assessing the CF focusing on water and electricity consumption in two types of residential buildings: mainly residential villas and residential flats. This assessment was carried out in Doha City, Qatar, using data on water and electricity consumption from 2017 to 2020. The study employs the Multi-Regional Input-Output Life Cycle Assessment (MRIO-LCA) model to calculate and convert the water and electricity consumption data into the CF of these buildings. Further, the study employs various methods for statistical and spatial statistical analysis of CF emissions, including geographically weighted regression (GWR), Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), and hotspot and cold spot assessments. The annual electricity CF emissions from these buildings are approximately 7 MtCO2 equivalent, with residential villas contributing about 83% of this total. Concurrently, the annual average water CF in residential buildings is around 0.06 MtCO2 equivalent, predominantly attributed to villas. The findings highlight the substantial impact of residential structures, particularly villas, on the city's overall CF emissions. Furthermore, the findings underscore the significant impact of residential structures, especially villas, on Doha's CF emissions, revealing a marked seasonal increase, particularly during the summer months and a notable spike in 2020. The spatial analysis of CF emissions reveals consistent spatial clustering patterns across different seasons in 2020. Elevated CF emissions from villas are concentrated in Doha's central, northern, and northeastern regions, while cold spots are predominantly in the eastern and southern areas. Understanding CF in residential settings is crucial for developing strategies to reduce emissions, enhance energy efficiency, and address climate change. This research helps inform targeted interventions for more sustainable residential energy and water use, aligning with broader environmental and climate goals.",,,

Quantitative estimates of the carbon footprint of urban ecosystems are crucial for developing low-carbon development policies to mitigate climate change. Herein, we reviewed more than 195 urban carbon footprint and carbon footprint related studies, collated the recent progress in carbon footprint calculation methods and research applications of the urban ecosystem carbon footprint, analyzed the research applications of the carbon footprint of different cities, and focused on the need to study the urban ecosystem carbon footprint from a holistic perspective. Specifically, we aimed to: (i) compare the strengths and weaknesses of five existing carbon footprint calculation methods [life cycle assessment, input–output analysis, hybrid life cycle assessment, carbon footprint calculator, and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)]; (ii) analyze the status of current research on the carbon footprint of different urban subregions based on different features; and (iii) highlight new methods and areas of research on the carbon footprint of future urban ecosystems. Not all carbon footprint accounting methods are applicable to the carbon footprint determination of urban ecosystems; although the IPCC method is more widely used than the others, the hybrid life cycle assessment method is more accurate. With the emergence of new science and technology, quantitative methods to calculate the carbon footprint of urban ecosystems have evolved, becoming more accurate. Further development of new technologies, such as big data and artificial intelligence, to assess the carbon footprint of urban ecosystems is anticipated to help address the emerging challenges in urban ecosystem research effectively to achieve carbon neutrality and urban sustainability under global change. Les écosystèmes urbains sont des systèmes complexes présentant des caractéristiques anthropiques qui génèrent des émissions considérables de CO2 contribuant aux changements climatiques mondiaux. Les estimations quantitatives de l’empreinte carbone des écosystèmes urbains sont cruciales pour l’élaboration de politiques de développement à faible émission de carbone visant à atténuer les changements climatiques. Dans cet article, les auteurs ont passé en revue plus de 195 études sur l’empreinte carbone urbaine et reliées à l’empreinte carbone urbaine, colligé les progrès récents en matière de méthodes de calcul de l’empreinte carbone et les applications de la recherche sur l’empreinte carbone des écosystèmes urbains, analysé les applications de recherche de l’empreinte carbone de différentes villes et mis l’accent sur la nécessité d’étudier l’empreinte carbone des écosystèmes urbains d’un point de vue holistique. Plus précisément, ils ont cherché à : (i) comparer les forces et les faiblesses de cinq méthodes existantes de calcul de l’empreinte carbone [évaluation du cycle de vie, analyse entrée-sortie, évaluation hybride du cycle de vie, calculateur de l’empreinte carbone et celle du Groupe d’experts intergouvernemental sur l’évolution du climat (GIEC)]; (ii) analyser l’état de la recherche actuelle sur l’empreinte carbone de différentes sous-régions urbaines en fonction de différentes caractéristiques; et (iii) mettre en lumière de nouvelles méthodes et de nouveaux domaines de recherche sur l’empreinte carbone des futurs écosystèmes urbains. Toutes les méthodes de comptabilisation de l’empreinte carbone ne sont pas applicables à la détermination de l’empreinte carbone des écosystèmes urbains; bien que la méthode du GIEC soit plus largement utilisée que les autres, la méthode hybride d’évaluation du cycle de vie est plus précise. Avec les avancées de la science et l’émergence de nouvelles technologies, les méthodes quantitatives de calcul de l’empreinte carbone des écosystèmes urbains ont évolué et sont devenues plus précises. Le développement ultérieur de nouvelles technologies, telles que celles qui utilisent les données massives et l’intelligence artificielle, pour évaluer l’empreinte carbone des écosystèmes urbains devrait aider à relever efficacement les nouveaux défis de la recherche sur les écosystèmes urbains afin d’atteindre la neutralité carbone et la durabilité urbaine dans le contexte des changements climatiques mondiaux.

Air Liquide has industrialized an innovative technology Cryocap™ H2, combining membranes and cryogenic solutions to capture CO2 most efficiently, at the lowest cost, and at a very high purity. This paper illustrates the impact of cost-effective partial capture technology choices (e.g. amine wash versus Cryocap™ H2) to CO2 emission reduction rates and overall carbon footprint. Direct and indirect emissions (i.e. Scopes 1, 2, and 3) were defined for each technology choice, alongside scenarios for low, medium, and high carbon footprint environments. The paper also explores an optimization path on the CO2 emissions reduction rate using a network configuration within a refinery. The study demonstrates that with Scope 1 emissions, the partial capture net CO2 emission reduction rate is 62% with a Cryocap™ standalone, 80% with a Cryocap™ Network, but only 56% with an amine wash due to its additional requirement of steam. Analysis of all emissions Scopes illustrates that Cryocap™ 's net CO2 emissions reduction rate ranges from 52% to 66% across low, medium, to high carbon footprint scenarios, and 39% to 44% for amine wash. The advantageous case for Cryocap™ across all three Scopes remains regardless of the additional steam production method (i.e. natural gas vs electric boiler).",,,

Further increase of sugarcane bioenergy is expected in India with the Government's mandate to enhance the share of renewable energy by 2030. Herein this study, district-wise sugarcane bagasse cogeneration potential is assessed in the state Maharashtra, India. Variations in energy, carbon and water footprint of energy generated from bagasse-based cogeneration plants are also assessed for all the districts considering farm to gate attributional life cycle assessment (ALCA). Avoided product function (also called as System expansion) of simaPro 9.2 LCA software is used to assess the environmental benefits of sugarcane waste or by-products (leaves and tops, press-mud and bagasse ash). The annual bagasse production potential in Maharashtra is 19 million tonne, equivalent to 8206 GWh of cogenerated electricity. The potential varies markedly among the districts (2–1500 GWh). Nearly 81 % of cogeneration potential is concentrated in 6 districts alone. The life cycle carbon footprint (0.075–0.2 kg CO2e/kWh), the energy footprint (0.75–2.12 MJ/kWh) and the water footprint (206–516 L/kWh)-all the three estimated on the life cycle basis- differ considerably among the districts. The nexus among water, energy, and carbon footprint for sugarcane bioenergy is also analyzed to understand the complex interconnectivities among these individual resources. Cultivating high yielding varieties, use of renewable energy-based micro-irrigation, and installing modern cogeneration technology can lower the estimated carbon, energy and water footprint by up to 50 %. Such measures will help enhance farmers' income while addressing the sustainability issues in India.",,,

Several studies indicated that feed additives such as 3-nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP) and nitrate have great potential to reduce enteric emissions. The objective of this study was to determine the net effects of 3-NOP and nitrate on farmgate milk carbon footprint across various regions of the United States and to determine the variability of carbon footprint. A cradle-to-farmgate life cycle assessment was performed to determine regional and national carbon footprint to produce 1 kg of fat- and protein-corrected milk (FPCM). Records from 1,355 farms across 37 states included information on herd structure, milk production and composition, cattle diets, manure management, and farm energy. Enteric CH4, manure CH4, and nitrous oxide were calculated with either the widely used Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Tier 2 or region-specific equations available in the literature. Emissions were allocated between milk and meat using a biophysical allocation method. Impacts of nitrate and 3-NOP on baseline regional and national carbon footprint were accounted for using equations adjusted for dry matter intake and neutral detergent fiber. Uncertainty analysis of carbon footprint was performed using Monte Carlo simulations to capture variability due to inputs data. Overall, the milk carbon footprint for the baseline, nitrate, and 3-NOP scenarios were 1.14, 1.09 (4.8% reduction), and 1.01 (12% reduction) kg of CO2-equivalents (CO2-eq)/kg of FPCM across US regions. The greatest carbon footprint for the baseline scenario was in the Southeast (1.26 kg of CO2-eq/kg of FPCM) and lowest for the West region (1.02 kg of CO2-eq/kg of FPCM). Enteric CH4 reductions were 12.4 and 31.0% for the nitrate and 3-NOP scenarios, respectively. The uncertainty analysis showed that carbon footprint values ranged widely (0.88–1.52 and 0.56–1.84 kg of CO2-eq/kg of FPCM within 1 and 2 standard deviations, respectively), suggesting the importance of site-specific estimates of carbon footprint. Considering that 101 billion kilograms of milk was produced by the US dairy industry in 2020, the potential net reductions of GHG from the baseline 117 billion kilograms of CO2-eq were 5.6 and 13.9 billion kilograms of CO2-eq for the nitrate and 3-NOP scenarios, respectively.",6,5083,

The increased popularity of cryptocurrencies since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009 has been accompanied by an increasing trend in greenhouse gas emissions and high electrical energy consumption. Popular energy tracking studies (e.g., Digiconomist and the Cambridge Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index (CBECI)) have estimated energy consumption ranges from 29.96 ​TWh to 135.12 ​TWh and 26.41 ​TWh to 176.98 ​TWh, respectively for Bitcoin as of July 2021, which are equivalent to the energy consumption of countries such as Sweden and Thailand. The latest estimate by Digiconomist on carbon footprints shows a 64.18 MtCO2 emission by Bitcoin as of July 2021, close to the emissions by Greece and Oman. This review compiles estimates made by various studies from 2018 to 2021. We compare the energy consumption and carbon footprints of these cryptocurrencies with countries around the world and centralized transaction methods such as Visa.

However, limited and threatened water resources may hinder the expansion of shale-derived natural gas, one of China's most promising development prospects. Coupling historical trends with policy guidance, we project that baseline water stress will intensify in two-thirds of China's provinces in the next decade. By 2035, annual water use for shale gas hydraulic fracturing activities is likely to increase to 16–35 million m3, with 13.8–23.7 million m3 of wastewater produced annually to extract 38–48 billion m3 of gas from ∼4800 shale gas wells. Analysis suggests that this projection is based on previously underestimated geological constraints (e.g., deep continental facies) in shale gas development in China. Nevertheless, forecasts suggest that the water footprint of shale development will become impossible to ignore, particularly in drought-stricken areas, indicating the potential risk of competition for water among shale development, domestic use, food production, and ecological protection.

However, these organizations need appropriate tools to measure and mitigate their climate impacts. One commonly applied method is carbon footprint analysis. Carbon footprint analyses have been conducted for various types of organizations, but knowledge organizations, such as universities and research institutes, have received far less attention, because their carbon footprint is often less visible and can be easily underestimated. This study is based on the carbon footprint analysis of one multinational knowledge organization. This analysis then helped identify the major sources of climate impacts in other such knowledge organizations. These are mainly indirect emissions (Scope 3) and to a large extent (79%) travel-related emissions. Based on these findings, three scenarios for a post-COVID-19 world were developed and analyzed. The results from the first two scenarios showed that despite a reduction in business travel and employees working from home, Scope 3 and travel-related emissions would remain the largest contributor. Only in the unlikely case of the third, non-recovery scenario did the share of travel-related emissions drop, turning heating into the largest contributor. In addition to measuring the carbon footprint, the study discusses potential mitigation strategies knowledge organizations could apply to reduce their carbon footprint. The focus is on how to avoid and reduce emissions, but new forms of carbon offsetting are also addressed. Based on the findings, a mitigation policy framework and recommendations for further research are proposed.",,,

The Calgary Urban Region case study is compared with the Kootenay Towns and Rural Region in the adjacent province. Top-down Statistics Canada villages surveyed across Canada on a five-year cycle function as the primary consumption data source. Building utilities energy, and registered vehicles fuel consumption add accuracy in quantification of Ecological Footprint housing and transportation components. Urban data is extrapolated outside the core city to evaluate regional Census Villages. This hybrid model proposes the national survey Census Villages function as the optimal Ecological Footprint geography. Top-down surveyed data supports municipal decision-making and bottom-up data extrapolated outside the core city allows precision climate action analyses and policy communications. Median household income remains a proxy and functions as the only footprint estimation for some components. Precision bottom-up data results in increased communications capabilities. The gamification of Villages is proposed to influence action on unsustainability in the promotion of thinking globally when messaging locally. This hybrid method proposes to inform and influence global sustainability via Canadian or other national similar sized survey geographies.

This study introduced the concept of embodied carbon and developed a new energy ecological footprint accounting model. The Spatial Durbin Model was used to analyze the spillover effects of various factors influencing the energy ecological footprint. The quantile regression method was applied to examine the phased impact of each influencing factor on spatio-temporal evolution of the energy ecological footprint. A nested matrix was constructed to classify the quantile response types of each influencing factor and the spatio-temporal transition types. Additionally, a governance model for regional energy ecological footprint reduction was proposed. The results showed that: First, the spatio-temporal distribution of the energy ecological footprint of China's 29 provinces was not completely random while the energy ecological footprint of each province had significant spatial correlation characteristics. Moreover, the change of energy ecological footprint affected by its neighboring provinces. Second, industrial structure, environmental regulation, and urbanization level had a critical effect on the spatio-temporal evolution of China's energy ecological footprint. Furthermore, each factor will affect the change of the energy ecological footprint in the surrounding areas through the spatial transmission mechanism of the influencing factors, and there was a significant spatio-temporal spillover effect. Third, there were driving and constraint modes of spatio-temporal transition in the process of spatial agglomeration of energy ecological footprint in each province. Quantile regression model can well explain the driving mechanism of each driving factor on the spatio-temporal transition of energy ecological footprint, and there was a strong nesting between the quantile of driving factors at different response stages and the types of spatio-temporal transition of energy ecological footprint. These findings can serve as a basis for decision-making and help formulate targeted policies, considering the “common but differentiated” approach, to reduce China's energy ecological footprint at the provincial level.",,,

Several efforts were made by many researchers towards developing various standards, techniques, and tools to assist in the management of the greenhouse gas emission from the industry. Some of these efforts include the green building concept itself, development of various rating systems, and sustainable construction materials. As such, this paper reviewed the several contributions of these researchers across the globe towards this dimension. And, after a thoroughly analysis of some of these contributions, it was found that there are inadequate research findings on the interconnected relationship between different drivers that are linked to low-carbon construction, highlighting the significant need for the establishment of an internationally recognized rating system under the United Nations which will include the measurements and quantification of the carbon footprint as one of its main parameters.",,,

Cotton is an economically important crop in China, but few reports have systematically quantified the carbon footprint of China's cotton production and analyzed its spatiotemporal changes and driving factors. This study used a life cycle approach to analyze the spatiotemporal changes and identify the main components and driving factors of the carbon footprint of cotton production in China between 2004 and 2018 based on statistical data. The results showed that the carbon footprint per unit area of cotton in Northwest China, the Yellow River Basin and the Yangtze River Basin reached 6220.13 kg CO2eq·ha−1, 3528.14 kg CO2eq·ha−1 and 2958.56 kg CO2eq·ha−1, respectively. From 2004 to 2018, the CFa in the Yellow River Basin and Northwest China increased annually, with average increases of 59.87 kg CO2eq·ha−1 and 260.70 kg CO2eq·ha−1, respectively, while the CFa in the Yangtze River Basin decreased by an average of 21.53 kg CO2eq·ha−1 per year. The ridge regression and Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) model showed that fertilizer, irrigation electricity and agricultural film were the main influences on carbon emission growth at the micro level and that the economic factor was the key factor at the macro level. Improving the efficiency of cotton fertilization and electricity use and ensuring the high-quality development of the cotton industry are effective strategies to reduce the carbon footprint of cotton cultivation in the future. This study comprehensively uses statistical data and mathematical modeling to provide theoretical support for accounting and in-depth analysis of cotton carbon emissions. The results are valuable for policy making related to sustainable development and the low-carbon development of the Chinese cotton industry.",,,

However, the literature has given limited attention to how consumers determine the impact of food on health (e.g., kilocalories) and on the environment (e.g., carbon footprint). In this exercise, 1511 consumers categorised 43 food products as healthy/unhealthy and good/bad for the environment, and estimated their kilocalories and carbon footprint, which were known to the investigator. The task was performed either with no stimuli (a control group), under time pressure only, with traffic-light labels only, or both. Results show that traffic-light labels: 1) operate through improvements in knowledge, rather than facilitating information processing under pressure; 2) improve the ability to rank products by both kilocalories and carbon footprint, rather than the ability to use the metric; 3) reduce the threshold used to categorise products as unhealthy/bad for the environment, whilst raising the threshold used to classify products as good for the environment (but not healthy). Notably, traffic-light increase accuracy by reducing the response compression of the metric scale. The benefits of labels are particularly evident for carbon footprint. Overall, these results indicate that consumers struggle to estimate numerical information, and labels are crucial to ensure consumers make sustainable decisions, particularly for unfamiliar metrics like carbon footprint.",,,

Wind power, as the second largest renewable energy source, plays an important role in the power industry, and clarifying the carbon footprint and carbon emission intensity of wind farms is the basis for their rational use. Although the study of the carbon footprint of wind farms has attracted considerable attention, the characteristics of the carbon footprint and carbon emission intensity of wind farms in grassland areas compared with other types of wind farms have not been determined to date. As an important part of the world's largest Eurasian grassland, the installed capacity of wind farms in the grasslands of Inner Mongolia ranks first in China. In this study, the carbon footprint of the production, transportation, construction, operation, and disposal stages was evaluated by using the life cycle assessment method in a 49.5 MW wind farm in the Inner Mongolia grassland, and its carbon emission intensity was explored in depth. The results showed the following: (1) The carbon footprint of the wind farm in the grassland area was 18701.29 t, of which the construction stage accounted for the largest proportion at 56.74%, and the other stages, ranging from highest to lowest, were production, disposal, transportation, and operation stages, which were 28.18%, 12.08%, 2.76%, and 0.24%, respectively. (2) The carbon footprint of material recycling was 18726.53 t, and the reduced carbon emissions accounted for 50.03% of the total carbon emissions. (3) The carbon emission intensity of the wind farm was 6.57 g/kWh, which is approximately 148.45 times, 72.91 times, 127.85 times, and 3.50 times less than the carbon emission intensity of the four non-renewable energy sources of coal, natural gas, oil, and nuclear power, respectively. (4) Wind power have lower carbon emission intensities than the four renewable energy sources of hydropower, biomass, and photovoltaics. This study highlights the very important role played by system boundaries when employing life cycles to evaluate carbon footprints. Compared with offshore wind farms and non-grassland wind farms, grassland wind farms have the lowest carbon emission intensity. The promotion of wind farms has excellent potential in grassland areas.",,,

In India, student enrollment in higher education has been increasing in recent years, reaching close to 4 billion, especially in universities. The present study aims to identify varying characteristics of FW generated in a university hostel mess due to temporal and seasonal conditions. This study evaluates consumer attitudes and behaviors concerning FW, and artificial neural networks are also used to forecast the percentage of FW streams based on various characteristics. FW characters were found to vary with time and temperature. High moisture content during autumn and winter seasons was found to decrease destructible solids content, a key parameter governing biogas generation. Statistical assay of FW quantity shows that FW generation is high during the weekdays followed by Saturdays, whereas during festivals and Sundays, the generation is highly variable, which might be due to the presence of inmates during holidays. Based on data from six months sample data set, it is projected that 716.57 ​kgs of food were wasted per day with 1361.48 ​kgs carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2 eq.) related CF. It showed that parameters such as household wealth, meal contentment, meal days, education, sex, and food-saving efforts significantly impacted the CF of FW. The avoidable FW can be stopped nonetheless to prevent shadowed CF. It can be concluded that effective FW management can be done by varying number of collection points, where FW accumulation varies in a year, enabling an efficient source sorting process. This will help in transferring the FW to proper treatment and management process like anaerobic digestion and composting. The Anaerobic digestion pose an efficient methods of FW management due to its high potency in biogas production.",1,,

Under the background of climate change and with the pressure of scarce water resources, the study of crop water footprints serves as a theoretical basis for regional optimization of water resource management, fine-tuning crop planting structures and actively addressing the negative impacts of climate change on agricultural production, among other critical issues. Leveraging meteorological and agricultural data, we employed Taiyuan which is situated in Fen River Basin as our focal research subject and calculated and analyzed the water footprint variations concerning six major food crops—wheat, corn, grain, sorghum, soybean, and potato—from 2000 to 2020. Through meticulous examination, we identified the predominant contribution of blue water (45 %) to the total water footprint, followed by green water (39 %), with grey water playing the smallest role (16 %), indicating that the use of water for crops in the Fen River Basin mainly consumes surface water and groundwater. Our investigation reveals a complementary association between blue water and green water, while both blue water and grey water exhibit an overall declining tendency from 2000 to 2020. Moreover, our predictive modeling of food crop water footprints, considering various SSPs-RCPs scenarios refered from IPCC, points towards a peak within the coming 10–20 years, with a growth rate of 16.2 % to 33.0 %, followed by a subsequent decline. Particularly, in SSP3-7.0 scenario, the water footprint of food crops presents the highest, with a growth rate of up to 33.0 % because of the continuous growth of population and the increase of crop sowing area, while in SSP1-2.6 scenario, the water footprint of food crops shows the lowest, with a growth rate of 16.2 % because of the decrease in population and crop sowing area, before the middle of the current century.",,,

The objective of this paper is to investigate the effects of globalization on the ecological footprint in 35 European countries in 1970–2020. While conducting the research, causality, which goes beyond correlation, was emphasized, and the new panel noncausality test is employed. The results indicate that globalization is generally Granger-cause of the ecological footprint in European countries. Additionally, the individual causation test results also show a unidirectional causality from economic globalization to the ecological footprint, bidirectional causality between social globalization and the ecological footprint, and no causality exists between political globalization and the ecological footprint. In conclusion, this paper not only provides valuable insights into the complex dynamics between globalization and ecological footprints but also offers nuanced policy recommendations tailored to European countries. These recommendations are designed to guide them toward achieving long-term sustainability in the face of the intricate relationships between globalization and ecological footprints.",,,

However, while the IoT is often presented as a promising solution to tackle environmental challenges, the direct environmental impacts generated over the life cycle of the physical devices are usually overlooked. It is implicitly assumed that their environmental burden is negligible compared to the positive impacts they can generate. Yet, because IoT calls for a massive deployment of electronic devices in the environment, life-cycle assessment (LCA) is an essential tool to leverage in order to avoid further increasing the stress on our planet. Some general LCA methodologies for IoT already exist but quantitative results are still scarce. In this paper, we present a parametric framework based on hardware profiles to evaluate the cradle-to-gate carbon footprint of IoT edge devices. We exploit our framework in three ways. First, we apply it on four use cases to evaluate their respective production carbon footprint. Then, we show that the heterogeneity inherent to IoT edge devices must be considered as the production carbon footprint between simple and complex devices can vary by a factor of more than 150×. Finally, we estimate the absolute carbon footprint induced by the worldwide production of IoT edge devices through a macroscopic analysis over a 10-year period. Results range from 22 to 562 MtCO2-eq/year in 2027 depending on the deployment scenarios. However, the truncation error acknowledged for LCA bottom-up approaches usually lead to an undershoot of the environmental impacts. We compared the results of our use cases with the few reports available from Google and Apple, which suggest that our estimates could be revised upwards by a factor around 2× to compensate for the truncation error. Worst-case scenarios in 2027 would therefore reach more than 1000 MtCO2-eq/year. This truly stresses the necessity to consider environmental constraints when designing and deploying IoT edge devices.",,,

The current levels of consumption-based carbon footprints in all developed economies grossly exceed the sustainable level. Scientists have concluded that in addition to technological solutions, downscaling of consumption and far-reaching changes in lifestyles will be needed to achieve environmental sustainability. In this study, we provide a tangible real-world example that reveals the scale of the needed change from a perspective of a European welfare state citizen. Universal basic income (UBI) represents an income that is just enough to fulfil basic needs, such as food, shelter, and medication. In our case country, Finland, UBI is in practice at the same level as the income of the lowest income decile. The purpose of this study is to present and analyse the carbon footprints at a consumption level that corresponds to UBI. We compare the carbon footprints at this low-income level to average Finnish carbon footprints and discuss their sustainability in the light of global carbon budgets. We use an input-output approach based on the Finnish ENVIMAT model. The average carbon footprint at the UBI level is 4.8 tCO2-eq and it focuses on necessities. It’s significantly lower than the average carbon footprint in Finland, 9.4 tCO2-eq, but still far from the level compatible with the current climate change mitigation targets.

However, both tillage and N are the main contributors to the carbon footprint (CF) in agricultural production. A 6-year-long field experiment was conducted under a winter wheat-summer maize cropping system in Northern China to test how tillage methods (RT, annual rotary tillage; DT, annual deep tillage; and TT, RT applied annually with a DT interval of two years) and N rates (300 kg ha–1, N300; 225 kg ha–1, N225; 165 kg ha–1, N165) affect SOC sequestration, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and annual grain yield. And, the CF was used to evaluate ecological sustainability. RT preferentially sequestrated SOC in the 0–10 cm soil layer. In the 10–30 cm soil layers, 2.87–3.82 and 1.85–2.53 Mg ha–1 greater SOC were respectively observed under DT and TT than RT, which was conducive to maximizing annual grain yield with less N application (N225) relative to traditional farming practice (RT-N300). Both increasing N rate and deep tillage resulted in obvious increases in the total GHG emissions. N fertilizer production and transportation were the greatest contributors, accounting for 40.4–47.0% of the total GHG emissions, followed by direct N2O and CH4 emissions (23.5–30.5%). TT-N225 significantly reduced CF (CF including SOC sequestration was 0.49 Mg CO2 eq ha–1 year–1 lower than DT-N225, and was 1.87 Mg CO2 eq ha–1 year–1 lower than RT-N300) and maintained high crop productivity while creating appropriate soil conditions and thus may be a much cleaner agricultural strategy in Northern China. And, the strategy of reducing N application in agricultural production by improving soil properties of the plow layer in this study can also be referred to in other ecological regions.",,,

One measure for reaching this target outlined in the NHS long-term plan (2019) is to reduce the carbon footprint of inhalational anaesthetic gases (IAGs). We modelled the synthesis of commonly used IAGs - sevoflurane, isoflurane, and desflurane - in comparison to intravenous propofol and estimated the carbon footprint generated throughout their lifetime, from manufacturing of raw materials to emissions of IAGs vented from operating theatres. We find that the carbon footprint of IAGs varies significantly depending on the method of chemical synthesis. Our results indicate that the carbon footprint of IAGs is minimised when using oxygen/air mix as the carrier gas at the lowest flow rate while applying a vapour capture technology (VCT). In this scenario, the carbon footprint of sevoflurane per minimum alveolar concentration hour is similar to that of propofol, which is a significant finding given that previous studies have favoured propofol as a means of carbon footprint reduction and only the active pharmaceutical ingredient of propofol was examined. Further, we show that the carbon footprint of sevoflurane used in the NHS during 2018, in the absence of VCTs, is not smaller than that of desflurane if sevoflurane is synthesised from tetrafluoroethylene. Therefore, to reduce the carbon footprint of IAGs, this study supports the continued reduction in the use of nitrous oxide and recommends a wider adoption of VCTs.",,,

Our findings show that the distribution of MNEs’ CFs is highly consistent with the distribution of their GVC production networks, where these CFs are mainly concentrated in advanced economies, and emerging markets and developing economies only account for a small but gradually increasing share. Further, MNEs’ CFs are mainly attributed to medium high/high-tech manufacturing, especially in emerging markets and developing economies, where over one-half of these firms’ CFs are generated in computer, electronics and optical products and motor vehicle production. Finally, we analyze the different impacts of changes in the emissions of domestic-owned enterprises, foreign-invested enterprises in host countries and emissions generated abroad on MNEs’ CFs as well as the main driving factors leading to these changes in the US, Germany, China, India, Mexico and Singapore. Our findings provide support for MNEs’ whole global-value-chain emission control to realize global carbon neutrality and shed light on possible pathways for mitigating the domestic carbon emissions of economies that are deeply integrated into GVCs.",,28,

There is limited literature on life cycle environmental performance of biojet fuel from 2nd generation biomass feedstocks. This work (i) assesses biojet fuel potential from rice, wheat, jute and potato residues in Bangladesh, and (ii) conducts farm to factory gate attributional Life Cycle Assessment of biojet fuel. Different scenarios suggest Bangladesh can produce 1074 to 2548 million liters of biojet fuel annually, with 1810 million liters per annum being the most optimistic potential. This is 4.5 times higher than the current jet fuel demand of the country. Carbon, energy, and landuse footprints of biojet fuel are lower than fossil jet fuel, however, water footprint is higher. Energy Return on Investment (EROI) of biojet fuel ranges from 1.60 to 1.78. The results will contribute to UN SDGs 7 & 13 and biojet fuel development in Bangladesh.",,,

To achieve efficiency and justice in emissions reduction, policymakers need to fully understand the sources of HCFs and identify the major causes of carbon inequality. By applying the Unconditional Quantile Regression (UQR) model and decomposition method to the Chinese household survey data, this paper investigates the distributional features of HCFs and their determinants. We find that HCFs are unevenly distributed due to differences in the volume and pattern of consumption, which are further determined by household characteristics and lifestyles. The intertemporal lifestyle changes have played a major role in the rise of HCFs inequality measured by various quantile emissions differentials. In addition, considerable increases in HCFs come from the high carbon emission groups, and most of the HCFs inequality stems from the 90–50 emissions differential. To transform the current carbon-intensive economy, policies are required to enhance environmental equity and encourage low-carbon lifestyles.",,,
JOUR,Hourly based methods to assess carbon footprint flexibility and primary energy use in decarbonized buildings,"['Álvarez Flórez, Laura', 'Péan, Thibault', 'Salom, Jaume']",Energy and Buildings,294,113213,2023,2023/09/01/,0378-7788,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2023.113213,['https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778823004437'],"['Demand response mechanisms', 'Energy flexibility in buildings', 'Household energy consumption', 'Hourly conversion factors', 'Carbon emissions', 'Primary energy use']","Constant emission factors to assess the carbon footprint of buildings energy use, as usually included in national Building Technical Codes, show their limitations since the electrical grid mix changes constantly. For this reason, hourly-based methods using time-varying penalty signals to calculate carbon emissions and primary energy use in buildings constitute more effective assessment methods, especially with the aim to activate energy flexibility in buildings based on those inputs. Such signals have been developed and tested in the present work. The robustness and effectiveness of the methods is tested throughout two study cases. The first case compares the impact of using hourly signals over constant factors from the standards. For that purpose, a measured aggregated consumption profile corresponding to 226 real households is analyzed. In the second study case, demand response is implemented through control strategies reacting to the hourly penalty signals, aiming to decrease the emissions, primary energy use and cost. Results for the first case reveal that hourly rates better capture the variability of the electric grid compared to constant yearly factors from national standards, with a 50% difference in carbon emissions and a 20% overestimation with primary energy. Results from the second study case show how the implemented modulation strategies offer benefits in the flexible scenarios compared to the base scenarios, in terms of accumulated emissions or primary energy. Improvements are especially perceived when splitting data seasonally and considering periods with higher demand. Furthermore, this study provides insights for developing energy flexibility inputs when assessing the building performance during critical events such as the COVID19 pandemic or extreme weather conditions, where hourly and seasonal variation might have greater impact. Demand response mechanisms as energy flexibility strategies studied through this work might help in the reduction of total emissions and primary energy. Depending if the goal is to shift the demand due to environmental or economical reasons, different modulation strategies can be implemented to reach greater benefits.",,,
JOUR,Single-item substitutions can substantially reduce the carbon and water scarcity footprints of US diets,"['Rose, Donald', 'Willits-Smith, Amelia M', 'Heller, Martin C']",The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition,115,378,2022,2022/02/01/,0002-9165,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/nqab338,['https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522001472'],"['sustainable diets', 'carbon footprint', 'water use', 'diet quality', 'diet substitutions', 'beef', 'NHANES', '24-h recall']","ABSTRACT Background Human food systems substantially affect the environment, but the impacts vary widely by food. Guidance to individuals to reduce their dietary impacts would benefit from easy advice, but little is known about the specific population impacts of simple changes on self-selected diets. Objectives The objective was to estimate the potential impact of a single dietary substitution on the carbon and water scarcity footprints of self-selected diets in the United States. Methods This cross-sectional modeling study used 24-h dietary recall data from the 2005–2010 waves of the NHANES. Greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) in the production of foods as well as irrigated water use, characterized by its relative scarcity at production locations, were matched to all foods in the recalls using previously developed databases. Impacts were summed to create carbon and water scarcity footprints for diets (n = 16,800) of adults aged >18 y. Diet quality was assessed using the Healthy Eating Index (HEI). Foods with the highest impact on GHGE and selected additional foods were substituted for calorically equivalent, less impactful items. Footprints were calculated before and after these hypothetical substitutions. Results The highest impact foods were all beef items, and 19.8% of individuals consumed them (n = 3320). After substitution of these items with poultry or pork, the mean carbon and water scarcity footprints among those with substitutions significantly decreased (P < 0.001) by 48.4 ± 0.6% and 29.9 ± 0.4%, respectively. Across the entire sample, these represented mean reductions of 9.6 ± 0.3% and 5.9 ± 0.2%, respectively. The mean HEI after substitutions was 3.6 ± 0.1% higher than before (P < 0.001). None of the selected additional foods had population impacts as large as the beef substitutions. Conclusions Simple substitutions can be made in individuals’ diets to substantially reduce their carbon and water scarcity footprints without sacrificing dietary quality. Such substitutions may be easier to promote than complex dietary patterns.",2,387,
JOUR,Does telemedicine reduce the carbon footprint of healthcare?

This report provides a systematic review of the evidence on the carbon footprint of telemedicine. The identified papers unanimously report that telemedicine does reduce the carbon footprint of healthcare, primarily by reduction in transport-associated emissions. The carbon footprint savings range between 0.70–372 kg CO2e per consultation. However, these values are highly context specific. The carbon emissions produced from the use of the telemedicine systems themselves were found to be very low in comparison to emissions saved from travel reductions. This could have wide implications in reducing the carbon footprint of healthcare services globally. In order for telemedicine services to be successfully implemented, further research is necessary to determine context-specific considerations and potential rebound effects.",1,e91,
