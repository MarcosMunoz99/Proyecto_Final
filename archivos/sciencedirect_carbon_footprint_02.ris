AB  - Due to the combined effects of carbon emission and carbon sink, agriculture is acknowledged as an essential contributor to achieve the Chinese government's carbon neutrality goal of 2060, and carbon footprint (CF) and carbon footprint intensity are substantial indicators to reveal the carbon emission level. For these reasons, the Theil index technique and extended STIRPAT model were employed to evaluate their spatiotemporal heterogeneity and influencing factors using panel data from 31 provinces for the period 1997–2019. The findings revealed that the CF showed an increasing trend with an annual growth rate of 24.6 %. The carbon footprint intensity (CFI) indicated an evident spatiotemporal heterogeneity and transferred over time, with an average growth rate of 19.82 %. The CFI Theil index and its contribution rate both confirmed that intra-regional difference is the main source of the overall difference, among which, the CFI Theil index displayed the distribution feature of “western (11.50 %) > central (11.12 %) > eastern (10.56 %) > northeast (6.61 %). The contribution rate of CFI illustrated the spatial pattern of “eastern (33.74 %) > central (21.07 %) > western (19.87 %) > northeast (5.24 %). Furthermore, the influencing effects of GDP per capita, planting structure, population density and urbanization level on CF and CFI also demonstrate evident spatiotemporal heterogeneity.

AB  - Based on the trade boom in the globalization wave, nowadays, food products travel long distances from producers to consumers. However, the embodied environmental impact associated with food consumption is still under discussion, which demands an in-depth analysis of its upstream environmental impact. Therefore, in this study, we consider Japan as a case study and apply an environmentally extended input-output table to tackle its embodied carbon footprint across sectors and regions. To further investigate the contribution of food transport, we extracted transport-related carbon footprints embodied in Japanese food consumption according to six transport types. The results indicate that 34% of the carbon footprints from Japan's food consumption were induced overseas, mostly being leaked in some Asian and Pacific countries (4536 kilo tonCO2eq in China and 4758 kilo tonCO2eq in other Asian and Pacific countries’ group) and the United States (4444 kilo tonCO2eq). The implications of this study reveal the key role of food consumption in Japan's future decarbonization and carbon neutrality, and provide potential mitigation measures to reduce transport emissions from the perspective of food supply chain.

AB  - Mitigating climate change by reducing anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions is considered an urgent challenge for society. In this context, different philosophies exist. A classic debate, referred to as “boomsters vs. doomsters”, asks whether humanity's drive for technological innovations will mitigate climate change, or whether it is justifiable to compromise our living standards, affluence, and consumption patterns. A Danish research project has elucidated this topic through cross-collaboration between historians and engineers by quantifying the personal consumption-based carbon footprint (CF) of Danish citizens, taking into account the consumption segments of food, transport, housing, and furniture. Quantification is conducted through life-cycle assessments (LCA) of five decadal timesteps during the period 1860–2020. As only one other study conducting historical (retrospective) LCA with an extensive time horizon was identified in the scientific literature, our own study provides novel insights by exploring possible approaches in this field. Historical LCA has many similarities with prospective (future) LCA, providing inspiration to the approach. The main challenge of the study is to adjust both foreground and background systems in the inventory modelling phase. Data is largely based on national statistics, books, museum case studies, expert testimonials, and proxies such as using the steam turbine as an indicator of improvements to technological efficiency over time. The results show a slightly declining carbon footprint in the period 1860–1930, from 7.7 to 6.6 t CO2-eq per capita annually. Unsurprisingly the footprint peak is not found until the 1970s, at 11 t, reducing to 5.4 t in the 2010s. The residential energy consumption segment contributes half of this CF, followed by transportation by road and rail. Discussion of the results shows that whether technology can mitigate the impact from the increase in affluence depends on the specific consumption segment. For housing combined with residential energy, the results show that technology can mitigate increases in CF, despite the comforts of home having only increased over time. For the transportation segment, however, the past century has seen an eightfold increase in CF due to the pronounced evolution of personal modes of transportation. The findings suggests that the “boomsters vs. doomsters” debate is not so black and white after all. We further suggest that historical LCA, in tandem with prospective LCA, can provide valuable insights for decision support to facilitate a green transition and hence a green future.

AB  - Considering the urgent target of carbon neutrality and environmental sustainability, this paper analyzes the nexus of energy efficiency, natural resources, and the digital economy on ecological footprint in OECD countries from 2002 to 2020. We apply the Method of Moments Quantile Regression (MMQR) to evaluate the long-run relationship of variables and check the mediating effect of renewable energy between the digital economy and ecological footprint. Through a series of empirical analyses, the primary results are as follows. First, it has been discovered that energy efficiency and natural resources contribute to decreasing ecological footprint. Second, the digital economy exerts a detrimental impact on the lowering of the ecological footprint. Third, the mediating outcome suggests that the digital economy cannot promote an ecological footprint decrease with the development of renewable energy. Based on the findings, we also recommend some ideas for OECD countries’ economy, energy, and environmental improvements.

AB  - The negative impacts of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly CO2 emissions, have garnered widespread attention. Various old residential areas in China, built more than 20 years ago, have been undergoing urgent transformation to improve citizens’ quality of life, which may significantly reduce carbon emissions. This study developed a carbon emissions accounting framework for residential areas to account the emissions impact of residential transformation. The framework addressed the inventory classifications of landscape greening, residential buildings, water resources, solid waste, infrastructure and transportation. The consumption-based calculation model and bottom-up data collection methods were used. The results show that the transformation of two old residential areas achieved considerable carbon reductions of 17.16% and 33.37% in South and North China, respectively. The macro guidance of local policies, specifically those regarding local urban infrastructure construction, significantly aided the carbon emissions reductions. Based on the calculation results, a list of recommended technologies was proposed to reduce carbon emissions, and four measures (adding greening, improving the garbage recovery rate, separating rain and sewage and transforming envelope structures for energy savings in northern China) were recommended to promote low carbon development in residential areas.

AB  - What is the carbon footprint of a common HPLC instrument per one measurement? How much will it increase when we use a mass detector instead of a spectrophotometer? What is the carbon footprint of an average laboratory in comparison to a household, petrol and electric cars, and group of people breathing simultaneously? How much do these results depend on the specifics of energy production in a given country? Is it possible to ensure the carbon neutrality of an advanced analytical method by using dedicated solar and wind farms? How large infrastructure is needed to supply the entire laboratory with green energy? What are the most reasonable activities which should be realized in the near future to reduce the environmental impact of analytical laboratories? This article attempts to answer these questions. The predictions are based on the simple measurements of the electricity consumption for selected laboratory instruments (separation techniques) and the commonly available statistical reports. The presented outcomes allow to imagine the magnitude of laboratory-related emissions. A future perspective is shown and discussed, embracing the three-dimensional space of possible efforts and the inclusion of energy consumption and associated carbon footprint as a mandatory validation criterion of new analytical methods.

AB  - Summary
Solar photovoltaics (PVs) installation would increase 20-fold by 2050; however, considerable greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are generated during the cradle-to-gate production, with spatiotemporal variances depending on the grid emission. Thus, a dynamic life cycle assessment (LCA) model was developed to assess the accumulated PV panels with a heterogeneous carbon footprint if manufactured and installed in the United States. The state-level carbon footprint of solar electricity (CFEPV-avg) from 2022 to 2050 was estimated using several cradle-to-gate production scenarios to account for emissions stemming from electricity generated from solar PVs. The CFEPV-avg (min 0.032, max 0.051, weighted avg. 0.040 kg CO2-eq/kWh) in 2050 will be significantly lower than that of the comparison benchmark (min 0.047, max 0.068, weighted avg. 0.056 kg CO2-eq/kWh). The proposed dynamic LCA framework is promising for planning solar PV supply chains and, ultimately, the supply chain of an entire carbon-neutral energy system to maximize the environmental benefits.

AB  - Blockchain technologies are considered one of the most disruptive innovations of the last decade, enabling secure decentralized trust-building. However, in recent years, with the rapid increase in the energy consumption of blockchain-based computations for cryptocurrency mining, there have been growing concerns about their sustainable operation in electric grids. This paper investigates the tri-factor impact of such large loads on carbon footprint, grid reliability, and electricity market price in the Texas grid. We release open-source high-resolution data to enable high-resolution modeling of influencing factors such as location and flexibility. We reveal that the per-megawatt-hour carbon footprint of cryptocurrency mining loads across locations can vary by as much as 50% of the crude system average estimate. We show that the flexibility of mining loads can significantly mitigate power shortages and market disruptions that can result from the deployment of mining loads. These findings suggest policymakers to facilitate the participation of large mining facilities in wholesale markets and require them to provide mandatory demand response.

AB  - To comprehensively understand the effects of different fertilization regimes on carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in apple orchard production systems, we assessed the carbon (C) emissions and nitrogen (N) losses along with the life cycle assessment (LCA) to quantify the carbon footprint (CF) and nitrogen footprint (NF) under different fertilization regimes in the Loess Plateau, China. The field experiment was comprising four N fertilizer regimes such as i) single inorganic fertilizer with 800 kg N ha−1 (N800); ii) single inorganic fertilizer with 400 kg N ha−1 (N400); iii) inorganic and organic fertilizers each with 200 kg N ha−1 (N200+O200) as well as without N fertilizer treatment as control (CK). Data regarding the soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrate N (NO3−–N), ammonium N (NH4+–N) and emissions of carbon oxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were measured. Organic fertilizer substitution (OFS) boosted SOC while decreased NO3−–N and NH4+–N concentrations. The cumulative CO2 emissions and emission factors (EFs) of N2O did not change significantly amongst fertilization strategies; however, as compared to N800, N400 and N200+O200 significantly reduced N2O emissions by 41.8%–45.7% and 43.5%–46.6% respectively. The NF was dominated by N residues (73.0%–97.4%) and organic fertilizer (24.37%), with a significant difference detected between N400 and N200+N200 treatments. Meanwhile, compared to inorganic plots, OFS significantly reduced CF (345.9%–368.0%), which was influenced by SOC sequestration. The CF from N plots in apple orchard was dominated by fertilizer (21.7%–39.6%), pesticides (4.3%–6.2%) and N2O (5.6%–11.8%). In addition, our results were further supported by a meta-analysis with 22 published studies, which showed that organic fertilizer and chemical fertilizer + organic fertilizer significantly reduced regional CF by 388.8% and 78.2%, respectively. However, regional NF ranged from 441.4 kg N-eq ha−1 to 453.9 kg N-eq ha−1, with no significant difference between fertilizer strategies. Therefore, reducing the amount of N fertilizer and partial OFS is a viable long-term strategy for mitigating climate change through C sequestration, reduction of N residues, and GHG mitigation, which could be beneficial to low C apple production in the Loess Plateau, China.

AB  - The shipping sector is facing increasing pressure to implement clean fuels and drivetrains. Especially hydrogen-fuel cell drivetrains seem attractive. Although several studies have been conducted to assess the carbon footprint of hydrogen and its application in ships, their results remain hard to interpret and compare. Namely, it is necessary to include a variety of drivetrain solutions, and different studies are based on various assumptions and are expressed in other units. This paper addresses this problem by offering a three-step meta-review of life cycle assessment studies. First, a literature review was conducted. Second, results from the literature were harmonized to make the different analyses comparable, serving cross-examination. The entire life cycle of both the fuels and drivetrains were included. The results showed that the dominant impact was fuel use and related fuel production. And finally, life-cycle hot spots have been identified by looking at the effect of specific configurations in more detail. Hydrogen production by electrolysis powered by wind has the most negligible impact. For this ultra-low carbon pathway, the modes of hydrogen transport and the use of specific materials and components become relevant.

AB  - The current study uses a detailed process based LCA model to evaluate the life cycle energy, carbon and water footprint of an existing 660 MWe supercritical coal powerplant in India retrofitted with the calcium looping based CCS system. LCA of the base case is followed by a sensitivity analysis to analyze effect of variation of different input parameters on the output performance metrics such as life cycle energy input, EROI, life cycle GHG emissions and life cycle blue water consumption. Further, the performance of calcium looping is compared with other mature CCS technologies such as MEA and oxycombustion, which are also retrofitted to the same existing coal power plant. Results show that, as compared to the base power plant, the life cycle energy input and life cycle blue water consumption of the integrated system using calcium looping increases by around 31 and 36% respectively, whereas EROI and life cycle GHG emissions decrease by 33–45% and 79–83% respectively. Sensitivity analysis results show that EROI has the largest variation range and change in rail transportation distance of coal leads to maximum variation in life cycle energy input, EROI and life cycle GHG emissions. Comparison of the three CCS technologies clearly shows that the integrated system using calcium looping has the lowest increase in life cycle energy input and life cycle blue water consumption and the lowest decrease in EROI. Thus, in addition to efficiently reducing CO2 emissions and enhancing power generation capacity of existing coal powerplants, use of calcium looping is also favourable from a life cycle sustainability perspective.

AB  - The relationship between a household's income and its carbon emissions is often summed up by a number, the elasticity of the carbon footprint with respect to income. I survey here the cross-sectional studies of household carbon footprints and their estimation of the elasticities with respect to income and with respect to expenditures. The difference between these two elasticities comes from the personal saving rate's increasing with income. I compile published estimates of the elasticities of the carbon footprint or energy requirements, and compute new estimates. This amounts to around 80 estimates (one-third of which are newly computed) for over 20 countries. It is found that, generally, the carbon footprint grows less rapidly than expenditure, and confirms that the income elasticity is lower than the expenditure elasticity. Unambiguously, the assumption of an income elasticity equal to unity is not supported by the published literature. I discuss the difference between carbon inequality and carbon concentration, the ambiguity in the literature between income elasticity and expenditure elasticity. I present the limitations of our knowledge of the relationship between income and carbon footprint, from contestable assumptions in the methodology as well as measurement errors in household budget surveys. I examine how elasticity can be used in “top–down” assessment of the global distribution of carbon footprints.

KW  - Greenhouse gas emissions
AB  - Manure replacing synthetic fertilizer is a viable practice to ensure crop yield and increase soil organic carbon (SOC), but its impact on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is inconsistent, thus remains its effect on CF unclear. In this study, a 7-year field experiment was conducted to assess the impact of replacing synthetic fertilizer with manure on crop productivity, SOC sequestration, GHG emissions and crop CF under winter wheat–summer maize cropping system. Five treatments were involved: synthetic nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizer (NPK) and 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of manure replacing synthetic N (25%M, 50%M, 75%M, and 100%M). Compared with NPK treatment, 25%M and 50%M treatments maintained annual yield (winter wheat plus summer maize) and sustainable yield index (SYI), but 75%M and 100%M treatments significantly decreased annual yield, and 100%M treatment also significantly reduced annual SYI. The SOC content exhibited a significant increasing trend over years in all treatments. After 7 years, SOC storage in manure treatments increased by 3.06–11.82 Mg ha−1 relative to NPK treatment. Manure treatments reduced annual GHG emissions by 14%–60% over NPK treatment. The CF of the cropping system ranged from 0.16 to 0.39 kg CO2 eq kg−1 of grain without considering SOC sequestration, in which the CF of manure treatments lowered by 18%–58% relative to NPK treatment. When SOC sequestration was involved in, the CF varied from −0.39 to 0.37 kg CO2 eq kg−1 of grain, manure treatments significantly reduced the CF by 22%–208% over NPK treatment. It was concluded that replacing 50% of synthetic fertilizer with manure was a sound option for achieving high crop yield and SYI but low CF under the tested cropping system.

The proposed table reflects the differences in terms of input structure and carbon emission intensity between each industry's formal and informal sectors. The results showed that the informal sector in several industries contributed significantly to the carbon footprint of the top three supply chains with larger CO2 emissions in India. The study suggests that environmental policymakers target the informal sector and identify the actors involved in achieving CO2 emission reduction in the informal sector.

AB  - Food security is increasingly a societal concern, also in developed economies. While originally developed through a nutritional lens, food security is also increasingly incorporating the environmental quality of diets. This study develops a Structural Equation Model to examine how consumers concerns over food insecurity – in terms of its impact on health and poverty – and environmental beliefs influence the carbon footprint of diets. Using data from a survey representative of the Italian population, this study shows that health-related food insecurity concerns increase the use of health motives when shopping for food, in turn reducing the carbon footprint of the diet. Conversely, poverty-related food insecurity concerns are associated to diets higher in carbon footprint, as they reduce health motives, and increase private shopping motives (e.g., taste, low price). Overall, the study highlights how shifts to more sustainable food systems require a better understanding of what motivate consumers to make more sustainable food choices.

KW  - Oxygen consumption
AB  - Bast fiber textiles have become increasingly popular as a sustainable alternative in recent years. Although the carbon emissions of bast fiber textiles have been studied using life cycle assessment method, there is a lack of comprehensive literature analyzing and summarizing the results. This study reviews the current state of research on the carbon emissions of bast fiber textiles. Compared to other plant fibers, there are fewer studies on the carbon footprint or life cycle assessment of bast fiber textiles, and these studies lack a comprehensive “cradle to grave” or “gate to grave” analysis. In addition, inconsistencies exist in the allocation methods used for carbon footprint assessments. This study suggests a combination of physical and economic allocation to conduct a more accurate environmental impact assessment of bast fiber textiles. On the basis of the above review, this study modularizes the process of the entire life cycle of textiles and analyzes the carbon sequestration and emission characteristics to determine the main considerations for carbon footprint assessment. The carbon sequestration effect of bast fiber textiles should be analyzed at the raw material extraction stage and at the end-of-life stage. Oxygen release and consumption are also considered as additional factors to be quantified and analyzed in this study. In the future, the modular method should be used for all carbon footprint evaluation reports for bast fiber textiles. This method helps to comprehensively quantify and evaluate the carbon footprint of bast fiber textiles throughout their entire life cycle. It can provide recommendations for green design, green production and sustainable consumption.

KW  - Carbon Inequality
AB  - The income and expenditure elasticity of household carbon footprints (CF) is a recurrent summary measure of the social stratification of greenhouse gas emissions. In top-down-estimates, when microdata are lacking, it is also used to estimate the inequality in emissions between households across the income or expenditure distribution. In this article, we point to several key methodological considerations when computing the elasticity of household CFs, and demonstrate their practical and empirical implications by making use of Belgian survey data. We find that the choice between income and expenditure as the main variable is most consequential for the estimated elasticity of household CFs, while the income elasticity of household emissions is more sensitive to a broader range of methodological choices. This has implications for top-down estimates of emissions along the income distribution, and related indicators of the inequality in household emissions by income groups.

AB  - Agricultural ecosystems are the main sources of soil-atmosphere exchange (methane-CH4, Carbon dioxide-CO2 and Nitrous oxide -N2O) in sub-Saharan African countries, including Kenya. To feed the ever-growing population, there is a need to identify agricultural management practices to increase food production while reducing GHG emissions for climate change mitigation and adaptation. This study aimed to estimate the GHG balance at the farm scale and identify environmental hotspots and mitigation opportunities among smallholder sorghum farms in Western Kenya. The study hypothesized that different intensification levels influenced the GHG balance. The study collected data from 300 smallholder farms in western Kenya. The principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis were used for farm typologies construction. Five farm types were constructed that ranged from no or minimal external inputs and highly intensified, small to large, and low to highly endowed in tropical livestock units. The Cool Farm Tool Excel program model was used to estimate GHG balances. that the sorghum cropping systems were net sinks of soil GHGs. The GHG balance, carbon footprint, and monetary footprint significantly varied across the farm types at p = 0.025, p = 0.018, and p = 0.004, respectively. The GHG balance ranged from – 818.76 kg CO2 eq. ha−1 in manure-intensive and low fertilizer-intensity small farms to 174.29 kg CO2 eq. ha−1 in fertilizer-intensive and moderate manure application rates on small farms. Fertilizer production and direct and indirect emissions (fertilizer application) were the environmental hotspots accounting for 63 and 30 % of the GHG emissions. The carbon and monetary footprints ranged from -1.29 to 0.45 kg CO2 eq. kg sorghum −1 and -2.02 to 0.13 kg CO2 eq. US$−1 generated, respectively. The study established that sorghum cropping systems in Kenya produced limited greenhouse gas emissions.

AB  - The increasing demand for environmentally friendly agricultural practices has driven the need for diversified crop cultivation to optimize crop productivity while minimizing carbon footprints (CFs). However, the impacts of crop diversification on crop production and environmental benefits are still poorly understood. In this study, conducted at two sites in the Yellow River Delta, China, we investigated the effects of legume intercropping, specifically maize/soybean (M/S) and maize/peanut (M/P) systems, on crop productivity, economic return, ecosystem economic budget (NEEB), CF, and carbon sustainability index (CSI) in comparison to conventional monocrops. Crops were grown in replicated field plots and fertilized in their strips according to common practice for monocrops. Compared to the expected averages of monocrops, maize/legume intercropping demonstrated higher crop yields, with M/S achieving a 37% and 43% increase at the two sites, respectively, and M/P achieving an 11% and 20% increase. The higher overyielding in M/S was attributed to stronger selection effects, i.e., interspecific facilitation. However, the complementarity effects induced by the competitive dominance of maize were similar in both intercropping systems. Additionally, M/S exhibited greater potential for improving net revenues compared to M/P. Life cycle assessments revealed lower CFs in the intercropping systems compared to monocultures. M/S reduced CFs per unit of area by 26.8% at both sites, CFs per unit of maize equivalent energy yield by 25% and 33%, and CFs per unit of revenue by 20% and 25% at the two sites, respectively. M/P also resulted in reduced CFs, albeit to a lesser extent. Intercropping enhanced the CSI, with the highest values observed in the M/S system. However, both intercropping systems showed limited effects on soil C sequestration. Overall, our results highlight that maize/legume intercropping is a feasible approach to enhance crop productivity while reducing CFs. The M/S system outperformed the M/P system in terms of crop yields, economic benefits, and CF reduction. However, the intercropping systems showed limited effects on SOC storage. This study provides important implications for sustainable agriculture by appropriate crop diversification.

AB  - Context
Rice-based cropping system is a major anthropogenic source of direct greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, agricultural inputs also produces numerous indirect GHG emissions and environmental problems. Identification of rice cropping systems with lower GHG emissions and higher grain yields is of great significance to ensure food security while minimizing agricultural carbon footprint (CF).
Objective
This study aimed to identify the optimal rice-based cropping system with lower greenhouse effects and comparable annual yield in central China.
Methods
Used life cycle assessment, a two-year field experiment was performed to evaluate the direct and indirect GHG emissions, CF, and carbon sequestration capacity in the six rice-based cropping systems widely used in central China, which consisted of fallow-early rice-late rice, rapeseed-early rice-late rice, fallow-ratoon rice, rapeseed-ratoon rice (RRaR), fallow-middle rice, and rapeseed-middle rice.
Results
The results showed that compared with the three systems with fallow season, the three systems with rapeseed had lower annual CH4 emissions. The two systems with ratoon rice had lower annual indirect and direct GHG emissions than the two systems with double rice. The three systems with rapeseed had higher annual biomass, grain yields, and fixed carbon in biomass and significantly lower CF than the three systems with fallow season, and RRaR had the highest value of fixed carbon in biomass. The systems with ratoon rice had lower average CF than those systems with double rice. CH4 emissions from paddy fields were the primary source of total annual GHG and the main component of CF. Compared with the three systems with fallow season, the three systems with rapeseed had significantly higher annual carbon sequestration capacity based on net ecosystem production (NEP). Ratoon rice systems had higher average NEP than double- and middle-rice systems. RRaR had the lowest CF per unit yield and highest NEP among all the six systems.
Conclusions
The results indicated that appropriate rice-based cropping systems may alleviate the greenhouse effect via reducing GHG emissions and enhancing paddy NEP, RRaR could achieve relatively higher annual grain yield and carbon sequestration capacity as well as lower CF.
Significance
This study highlight conversion of double rice and middle rice systems to RRaR may help improve grain yield and mitigate greenhouse effect. The findings may provide a theoretical basis for selection of sustainable development of rice based cropping systems in central China.

AB  - Soybean is a global crop with significant environmental externalities. However, as an agricultural system, it is also vulnerable to extreme events associated with climate change, such as droughts. Nevertheless, there is a gap in the literature regarding how these extreme events can influence the carbon footprint of soybean production. To better understand the climate implications of soybean production, this study assessed and compared the carbon footprint in the Paraná State, Brazil, during the 2020|21 super harvest and the 2021|22 rainfall scarcity. The method of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and the cradle-to-gate perspective were applied using the ImpactWorld+ for Continental Latin America v.1.251 method to calculate the climate change impacts. The uncertainties of short and long-term climate impacts were calculated by the Monte Carlo simulation. The results showed that the carbon footprint of the 2021|22 harvest was 267% greater than that of the 2020|21 harvest, while the 2020|21 production was 86% greater than that of 2021|22. The reduction in productivity observed in 2021|22 soybean crop contributed the most to the long-term climate impacts and impacts on ecosystems and human health. The study showcased the significant short-term impact of climate change on soybean production but also its equally considerable, long-term impact on global food security.

AB  - The environmental impact of new products and production processes is one of the most important indicators of the current time. Many methods exist to estimate ecological metrics, such as the Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) in the individual product development phases with stand-alone software. However, methods to integrate the PCF in the entire process chain with the possibility to interact in the process are missing. This paper presents a new approach to measuring the ecological impact of an Additive Manufacturing production process, exemplified by the Material Extrusion (MEX) process. The novelty of the approach lies in implementing a single software for machine control, processing, and visualization of sensor signals, parameter variation, and reporting functions to enable comprehensive PCF management. The workflow includes a model-based prediction of the PCF based on the G-code, live monitoring during the production phase, and a subsequent automated evaluation at a central interface. Critical points can be identified, and approaches for optimizing the MEX process can be designed. Uncertainty evaluation of the PCF based on the combination of uncertainty of the sensors and the Life Cycle Assessment is included in the method. The developed prototype software can be used in the design phase for prediction and in the process phase for optimization, enabling seamless PCF management for the MEX process.

AB  - New Zealand (NZ) is the world's largest exporter of sheep meat and an important exporter of beef. Given the current concern about the impact of food production on climate change, it is important to understand the extent of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for NZ exported products. This Life Cycle Assessment study calculated the cradle-to-grave carbon footprint of beef and sheep meat produced in NZ and exported to different markets. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the effect of different Global Warming Potential (GWP) metrics, carbon sequestration by trees on farms and different allocation methods at the processing stage. The carbon footprint for the cradle-to-farm gate represented 90–95% of the cradle-to-grave for both beef and sheep. At the farm gate (not accounting for the sensitivity analysis studied), the beef results were influenced by the contribution of dairy beef, which showed a 34% lower footprint than traditional beef (8.97 and 6.88 kg CO2e kg−1 LW, respectively). Sheep meat had lower emissions than beef for the on-farm stage (6.01 kg CO2e kg−1 LW). For GWP*, the estimated footprint values were much lower, especially for sheep, where the national flock decreased over the last 20 years. National data on net carbon sequestration by trees within farms was significant and equated to 29% of the total on-farm GHG emissions. The meat processing stage contributed 2–4% of the carbon footprint, while post-processing was 2–6%. Despite the long shipping distances involved, NZ beef and sheep meat supplied to international markets have a full life-cycle carbon footprint at the lower end of other published estimates.

AB  - Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) play a crucial role in driving energy transitions, particularly in electric vehicles (EVs) and energy storage systems. Forecasting LIB prices has received significant attention due to the tightening of raw material markets. Additionally, the implementation of carbon pricing policies has highlighted the need to incorporate the carbon footprint of LIBs in price evaluation. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the carbon footprint, pricing trajectories, and forthcoming carbon pricing ramifications associated with LIBs. Firstly, the findings derived from the life-cycle carbon footprint assessment indicate that the global production volume-weighted average carbon footprint of EV battery packs spans 49.2–81.1 kgCO2eq/kWh, depending on the chosen end-of-life treatment. Strategic end-of-life selections, aligned with battery chemical composition, can diminish the carbon footprint by up to 46% relative to improper disposal methods. Notably, direct cathode recycling of NCA and NMC622 batteries exhibits superior environmental performance. Secondly, techno-economic analysis predicts that the mean price of EV battery packs with diverse chemical compositions will decline to $75.1/kWh by 2030, factoring in the compound annual growth rate of critical raw material prices over the past decade. LFP batteries emerge as the top economic performers. Lastly, the results reveal that monetizing a battery's carbon footprint may offset battery price reductions through learning effects. This underscores the imperative of effective recycling for curtailing the carbon footprint and ensuring the enduring economic and environmental competitiveness of LIBs.

The studied vehicle fleet consists mostly of vehicles with an internal combustion engine (ICEV), and hence the potential reduction of CO2 emissions with this kind of fleet is very limited. Propositions for more sustainable vehicle fleet are made and the potential of car-sharing service in Finland is discussed. The results show that users are replacing sustainable transport modes (walking, cycling) with car-sharing services. Replacing ICEVs with battery electric vehicles (BEV) would allow 31 % decrease in CO2 emissions. However, this would require major changes to the fleet.

Yet, we do not observe a significant effect on non‑carbon footprints.

KW  - Bangladesh
AB  - Carbon footprint (CF), a measure of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, is currently a global concern because of its significant effects on climate change. Understanding GHG emissions from potable water production is important because water treatment and distribution consume much energy while emitting a significant amount of GHG. With economic and population growth, water demand has increased, resulting in higher GHG emissions. This study aims to assess the CF of potable water production in Bangladesh, focusing on the country’s economic capital, Chattogram. This study estimates and compares the CF of the treatment, distribution, and consumption phases. It also estimates the CF of different water treatment plants (WTPs) during the treatment phase. WTPs use electricity for a full-scale operation, during which approximately 4.5 million m3 of raw water of varying turbidity is treated. This study calculates a country-specific GHG emission factor for Bangladesh’s electricity generation method as different sources produce different quantities of GHGs. This study also considers the energy consumed to distribute water from the WTPs to household rooftop tanks in the distribution phase. For the consumption phase, the study considers the energy consumption for domestic water treatment, which involves boiling of a portion of treated water for drinking purposes. The study estimates that approximately 0.18, 0.27, and 17.52kg CO2-eq are emitted in the treatment, distribution, and consumption phases, respectively, for the production of 1 m3 of water. Boiling at the consumption phase alone generates 97.48% of the total CF. The daily CFs for surface water and groundwater use in 2017 were 16,387.78 and 34,092.08kg CO2-eq, respectively; those in 2022 were 83,769.25 and 2,130.97kg CO2-eq, respectively. The outcome of this study will assist stakeholders and policymakers in the progress of SDG-13 and in effective planning and operational decision making for sustainable water systems.

AB  - We estimate the prefecture-level city scale carbon footprint and associated uncertainties for three staple crops in China, and make all our raw data publicly available. The carbon footprint of maize, wheat, and rice is estimated at 3620 kg CO₂e ha−1 (1259–5552 kg CO₂e ha−1, 95 % confidence interval), 3153 kg CO₂e ha−1 (1359–5214 kg CO₂e ha−1), and 9494 kg CO₂e ha−1 (3450–16,491 kg CO₂e ha−1). For maize, the Northwest has high emissions intensities and the Northeast has low emissions intensities, with relatively even uncertainty across space. For wheat, the Southwest is characterized by low emissions intensities but high uncertainties, and the opposite is true for the East. For rice, the Northeast is characterized by low emissions intensities and low uncertainties and the Southeast by high emissions intensities and high uncertainties. Our study identifies crop carbon and uncertainty hotspots at the city scale, providing an important reference for future research.

AB  - The impact of pork production on global livestock’s greenhouse gas emissions is substantial. Understanding the factors influencing these emissions is crucial in achieving a more sustainable pig husbandry. In two independent experiments, the impact of slaughter weight on the carbon footprint (CFP) of pig feed intake (CFPFI) was evaluated for growing-finishing pigs of different sexes (entire males (EM), barrows (BA), immunocastrates (IC) and gilts (GI)). In experiment 1 118 animals were raised individually in experimental conditions. In experiment 2 384 animals were housed in group (four pigs per pen), in controlled commercial farm circumstances. All animals were fed ad libitum in a three-phase feeding regime and slaughtered at different BW, ranging from 110 to 148 kg (experiment 1) and from 99 to 138 kg (experiment 2). When only the fattening period was considered, the CFPFI was expressed per kg carcass growth. When the production of piglets was also taken into account, the CFPFI was calculated per kg carcass weight. For all sexes, the heavier the pig, the higher the CFPFI per kg carcass growth (P < 0.05, experiment 1; P < 0.001, experiment 2) and per kg carcass weight (P < 0.05, experiment 1; P < 0.01, experiment 2). In addition, BA had a significantly higher CFPFI per kg carcass growth and per kg carcass weight compared to EM and IC and to EM, IC and GI in respectively experiments 1 and 2 (P < 0.001). When performing a desk study with a soy-free (i.e. reduced CFP) feed in the third phase of experiment 2, slaughter weight no longer affected the CFPFI per kg carcass growth (P = 0.133) and per kg carcass weight (P = 0.856). A higher slaughter weight thus implies a lower sustainability, unless a sufficiently low-CFP feed is provided in the finisher phase.

AB  - Summary
Purpose
The healthcare system emits greenhouse gas emissions and produces waste that in turn threatens the health of populations. The objective of our study was to measure the ecological threat related to intravitreal injections.
Methods
Emissions were separated into scope 2 corresponding to Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) of the building, and scope 3 corresponding to travels (patients and staff), and life cycle assessment (LCA) of medical devices (MD) and pharmaceutics. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and waste for a single injection were first measured through a waste audit, and secondly anticipated theoretically with a calculator.
Results
The average GHG emissions and waste measured were 277kgCO2eq/IVI and 0.5kg/IVI, respectively. Pharmaceuticals were responsible for 97% of total emissions. Emissions unrelated to pharmaceuticals counted for 8.4kgCO2eq/IVI. GHG emissions and waste estimated with the calculator were 276kgCO2eq/IVI and 0.5kg/IVI, respectively, showing that the calculator was accurate.
Conclusion
Our study provides a puzzle piece to carbon footprint and waste assessment in the field of ophthalmology. It may help provide concrete data for future green vs. vision discussions.
Résumé
Objectif
Le système de santé émet des émissions de gaz à effet de serre et produit des déchets qui à leur tour menacent la santé des populations. L’objectif de notre étude était de mesurer l’impact écologique en lien avec les injections intravitréennes.
Méthodes
Les émissions ont été réparties entre le SCOPE 2 correspondant au chauffage, à la ventilation et à la climatisation (CVC) du bâtiment, et le SCOPE 3 correspondant aux déplacements (patients et personnel) et à l’analyse du cycle de vie des dispositifs médicaux et des produits pharmaceutiques. Les émissions de gaz à effet de serre (GES) et les déchets pour une injection unique ont d’abord été mesurés par analyse des déchets, puis anticipés théoriquement à l’aide d’un calculateur.
Résultats
Les émissions de GES et les déchets mesurés étaient respectivement de 277kgCO2eq/injection intravitréenne (IVT) et de 0,5kg/IVT. Les médicaments étaient responsables de 97 % des émissions totales. Les émissions non liées aux médicaments représentaient 8,4kgCO2eq/IVT. Les émissions de GES et les déchets estimés à l’aide du calculateur étaient respectivement de 276kgCO2eq/IVI et de 0,5kg/IVT, faisant du calculateur un outil précis.
Conclusion
Notre étude apporte une pierre à l’édifice de l’évaluation de l’empreinte carbone et des déchets dans le domaine de l’ophtalmologie.

AB  - Leisure travel within the European Union (EU) contributes significantly to the carbon footprint of global tourism. Distance travelled is a main factor in this impact, but some of its determinants remain unexplored. We examined the role of tourists' holiday preferences in shaping the carbon footprint of leisure travel within the EU by calculating demand and impact indicators associated with eight holiday styles. We find a substantial and equivalent carbon footprint for visiting relatives, nature tourism and sea, sun and sand tourism, but a higher carbon intensity of travel per trip for the latter. This is due to widespread demand for sea, sun, and sand tourism despite the concentration of destinations in Southern Europe. Furthermore, international travel within the EU is on average three times more carbon intensive than domestic travel. Our insights suggest that tourists’ holiday preferences can be leveraged for the sustainable development of leisure travel within the EU.

AB  - This study explores the integration of Blockchain Technology (BCT) with Green Product Platforming (GPP) in the agri-food industry, addressing the gap in empirical evidence about BCT's effective contribution to enhancing carbon and the economic performance of supply chains. It aims to analyze the impact of BCT-enabled GPP on reducing the carbon footprint and enhancing economic performance in the agri-food sector. In the agri-food sector, BCT-enabled platforms are emerging as critical methods. These platforms are characterized by their assortment of consistent modules and interfaces, adept at efficiently producing and digitally delivering diverse green products. The research combines quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews to examine the interplay of BCT as a digital technology and GPP and the significant role of stakeholders' stress in driving the effectiveness of BCT-enabled GPP, exploring the conditions of its positive impact on carbon and economic performance. The findings indicate the importance of aligning GPP initiatives with stakeholder expectations and leveraging BCT to navigate and capitalize on stakeholder pressures for improved carbon and economic performance. Highlighting actionable insights, this research offers a roadmap for agri-food managers to harness technological advancements to meet the dual objectives of sustainability and competitive advantage. Therefore, the paper presents a nuanced analysis of how BCT-enabled GPP can revolutionize the agri-food industry toward a more sustainable and efficient future. The study acknowledges limitations, notably, the variability in BCT implementation across the agri-food sector and the need for ongoing evaluation due to blockchain's evolving nature. Future research should explore BCT's diverse applications in agri-food contexts and its scalability within complex supply chains.

AB  - Because of global warming, integrating an ecological dimension to the practice of pathology is crucial, as already performed in other medical specialties. The aim of the study was to estimate the greenhouse gas emissions (GHE) of one biopsy/surgical specimen hematoxylin-phloxine-saffron (HPS) slide, one frozen section examination, and one immunohistochemistry (IHC) slide, and to propose environmentally friendly recommendations. The different steps of the pathological procedures, from sample transport to slide/block destruction, were considered for the GHE evaluation. Consumables and reagents used at each step were noted, as well as the electricity consumption of the premises/equipment, specific wastes, and staff travel. The GHE analyses were performed according to the eco-audit method. The GHE attributable to one HPS slide of a biopsy, one HPS slide of a surgical specimen, one frozen section examination, and one IHC slide were 0.589 kgCO2e (CO2 equivalent), 0.618 kgCO2e, 1.481 kgCO2e, and 0.363 kgCO2e, respectively. For a one-year activity in the pathology department, the GHE for HPS was estimated at 91,897 kgCO2e, equivalent to 422,321 km of thermal car ride. The main GHE sources were staff travel for one biopsy HPS slide (34.2 %) and one surgical specimen HPS slide (32.6 %), materials (39.1 %) and staff travel (27.2 %) for one frozen section examination, and staff travel (28.2 %) and reagents and their packaging (44.9 %) for one IHC slide. The present study highlighted the most significant sources of GHE for routine practices in a pathology department, underlining that, from pathologists to policy makers, each actor has a responsibility to implement sustainable changes.

AB  - As an answer to the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, organizations are increasingly making efforts to account for their carbon footprint. While general guidelines for carbon footprint calculation exist, they usually do not consider special characteristics of organisations such as institutions of higher education. Case studies can act then as learning tools, and comparisons between applied methodologies can be used to develop best practices. However, a lack of case studies published in peerreviewed journals limits access to the calculation results. This work provides a case study for a Northern European institution to extend the pool of available calculation methodologies tested under real-life conditions. The carbon footprint calculation of the University of Oulu utilises a hybrid model, combining approaches of Environmentally Extended Input-Output Analysis and Life-Cycle Assessment. The focus of the work was to consider included scopes and categories of emissions that represent indirect and non-energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, such as commuting or procurement of research and laboratory equipment. In 2019, the institution’s emission inventory sums up to 19,072 t CO2e, with the highest share due to the use of district heat on campus. Another goal of conducting this research was to show the limitations researchers might encounter when analysing caused emissions on an organisational level, and how the calculated carbon footprint can help to identify the best mitigation measures and possibilities for universities to reach carbon neutrality. It was found that the availability of information and missing strategies for data collection are prominent limiting factors. Favourable mitigation measures include the implementation of energysaving policies and improved policies for procurements.

AB  - Bitcoin is a breakthrough financial technology but a volatile asset in financial markets with a complex fundamental consensus algorithm (Proof-of-Work) limiting its large-scale adoption due to environmental-related issues. Hitherto, the role of its technical and infrastructural composition that drives carbon footprint from an ecological perspective is rarely discussed in the literature. Here, we use machine learning and econometric techniques to analyze the past, present, and future changes in Bitcoin's carbon footprint with daily data spanning July 18, 2010 to December 04, 2021. We document technical drivers, decomposition effects, causal nexus, and implications of the Bitcoin blockchain's increasing energy and carbon footprint. We show that Bitcoin's technical drivers could have potential impacts on Bitcoin's carbon footprint, and subsequently, global climate change. For example, the network's hashrate increases mining difficulty––thereby increasing Bitcoin's energy consumption and subsequently, carbon footprint. We observed a direct association between the marginal effect of block size and transaction count––implying that a higher block size improves transaction efficiency and then reduces Bitcoin's energy and carbon footprint. Besides, low mining difficulty increases market capitalization whereas increasing mining difficulty reduces bitcoin mining profit in the long run. This infers the reward for mining Bitcoin has a diminishing return in the long term. Thus, the adoption of advanced hardware for Bitcoin mining will spur energy and carbon intensity, yet will have a low return on investment. We highlight environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could limit Bitcoin's carbon footprint.

AB  - The escalating carbon emissions from global civil aviation, exceeding 70% of the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) forecasted levels between 2013 and 2019, underscore an urgent need for sustainable practices in airport terminal production. To address this challenge, the present study has formulated a multi-objective optimization model that comprehensively incorporates two crucial aspects: carbon emissions from airport terminals and passenger comfort. Specifically, models for carbon emissions and indoor environmental air quality are developed, taking into account factors such as ambient temperature, light intensity, noise, and ventilation quality concerning both airport terminal emissions and passenger comfort. Building upon these models, a multi-objective programming framework is devised, considering practical operational constraints. To contend with uncertainties in model parameters, the model is evolved into a fuzzy optimization framework and thereafter solved by the fuzzy optimization theory. The model's viability is tested through a case study of Mianyang Airport's terminal in China's southwestern region. In the context of concurrently considering carbon emission reduction and optimizing indoor environmental quality, winter carbon emissions increased by 212.09% compared to summer, while indoor environmental quality declined by 5.68%.

AB  - Aerobic pre-treatment of liquid dairy manure has previously been reported as an effective nutrient export and emissions mitigation approach. The first objective of this study was to experimentally determine the optimal intermittent aeration ratio for nutrient recovery from liquid dairy manure through an on-site pilot-scale reactor to partially reduce the required energy for the aerobic process. The second objective was to theoretically investigate the total carbon footprints of direct manure spreading on croplands and permanent manure storage in open anaerobic lagoons in response to nutrient removal by the optimal determined intermittent aerobic treatment ratio. Four scenarios (S) were included; S1 was the traditional scenario of manure spread on croplands without the aerobic pre-treatment, S2 was the modified scenario of manure spread on croplands that included the aerobic pre-treatment, S3 was the traditional scenario of manure storage in lagoons, and S4 was the modified scenario of manure storage in lagoons that included the aerobic pre-treatment. The results showed that comparable nutrient removal efficiencies could be obtained with a 5:1 intermittent aeration ratio. Total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were recovered were 41.5 ± 1.3% and 37.0 ± 4.0%, respectively, in ammonium sulfate and phosphorus-rich sludge, while 55.3 ± 1.4% of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) was removed. The estimated total carbon footprint for S1, S2, S3, and S4 were 24.4, 37.9, 45.3, and 45.9 kg CO2-eq ton−1, respectively. However, the total carbon footprint of S2′ and S4′, which used renewable-based energy to run the reactor instead of fossil-based energy used in S2 and S4, were estimated to 29.5 and 37.5 kg CO2-eq ton−1, respectively. Clearly, applying the aerobic pre-treatment increased the total carbon footprint of all cases except S4′, in which the total carbon footprint was mitigated by −17.2%. Accordingly, the aerobic pre-treatment is only recommended in the case of S4’ from a carbon footprint point of view although it is an effective nutrient recovery technology.

AB  - Hong Kong has planned to achieve zero-carbon emissions before 2050. Hong Kong's building sector is responsible for approximately 60 % of carbon emissions, while its evolutionary trajectories and neutrality pathway remain unclear. To this end, we adopt the STIRPAT model and machine learning approach to identify the most relevant factors and determine their historical correlation with building energy consumption. Then, the out-of-sample prediction is conducted to explore the energy pathway and carbon footprint towards 2050 in the Hong Kong building sector under various assumptions and scenarios. The predicted results suggest that electricity consumption and carbon emissions will continue to increase following current trends. In a moderate scenario, if 2.2 % and 1.6 % of residential and commercial buildings are replaced annually with 2.75 % better energy-performance construction, their electricity consumption is likely to reach 30 %–40 % and 20 %–30 % from the 2015 level as the HK2050 required. With lower electricity emission intensity, the Hong Kong building sector could achieve near zero emissions. Our projection is valuable for developing energy-saving and emission-mitigation strategies towards various carbon neutrality goals in the building sector.

AB  - In view of growing greenhouse gases and climate change, this paper investigates the effect of per capita income, renewable energy, natural resources, trade, and urbanisation on the material footprint of Saudi Arabia. This study uses data from 1990 to 2019. Autoregressive Distributed Lag, Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares, Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares, and Canonical Cointegrating Regression are used as estimation techniques. The result hints that per capita income, renewable energy, natural resources, trade, and urbanisation are determinants of material footprint in Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, the short- and long-run results show that per capita income, trade, and urbanisation increase material footprint, contributing significantly to Saudi Arabia's ecological damage. However, renewable energy and total natural resources rent reduce the material footprint in both periods. Other cointegration techniques also support the long-run estimates. The implications of the result for a sustainable environment were discussed.

AB  - Ensuring an economically viable, sustainable and low CO2 emission extractive fishery is critical in order to achieve the life below water UN sustainable development goals and the climate change commitments of Paris agreement. This challenge is even more relevant in the most overexploited region of the world: The Mediterranean Sea. Here, we use the socio-ecological system of the Spanish Mediterranean commercial fisheries (Northern Alboran Sea, Northern Spain and the Balearic Islands) to develop an integrative impact assessment, including detailed socio-economic, ecosystem indices of the trophic structure of extractive fishery and CO2 emission analyses combining different gear, vessel size classes as well as a wide range estimation of carbon release from the seafloor by bottom trawling. Northern Alboran Sea preferentially requires reduction in purse seine fishery while in Northern Spain bottom trawling should be reduced first to reach sustainable exploitation. Fuel CO2 footprint of purse seine and bottom trawling are among the lowest footprints of animal protein production, but considering sweeping released CO2 from the seafloor the bottom trawling footprint becomes the animal protein production with the highest footprint. Moreover, the lowest bottom released CO2 estimation overrides 2.7–10 times the CO2 buried in the seafloor through the biological pump in trawled areas potentially turning the continental shelf from a CO2 sink to a CO2 source. Net profit per fuel derived CO2 emission for all fleets is lower than 1€ kgCO2−1, being lowest for large bottom trawler (0.025 € kgCO2−1). Thus, urgent mitigation and adaptation measures are necessary to obtain sustainable fishery in terms of net profit, sustainable seafood extraction and CO2 emission reduction. Our study provides scientific bases to develop these measures such as the restriction of harmful fishing gear in carbon rich river influenced areas, reduction of bottom contact of the fishing gear, favouring purse seine fishery and smaller bottom trawlers.

AB  - Traditionally, construction waste management researchers have been less interested in carbon emissions, as the construction waste they deal with is largely solid and visible while carbon emissions are opposite. However, this situation has gradually changed, as carbon footprint quantification in construction waste allows for performance benchmarking with other circular economy initiatives. This study presents the first systematic review of construction waste-related carbon emission accounting methods. By analysing 108 journal articles, the review identified seven types of activities (e.g., generation, transportation, sorting, reusing, recycling, landfilling, and incineration) contributing to carbon emissions across the construction waste lifecycle. They encompass four types of emission-producing unit processes: mechanical operation, manual operation, chemical reaction, and material replacement. Each has a distinct emission accounting formula, but follows a generalized principle “Emission per unit × Unit”. Also, existing studies exhibit five evolution trends in this research field: shifting from single-stage accounting to lifecycle assessment; from simple calculation to complex conversion; from project-scale to urban-scale emission investigation and management; from accounting exercises to policy implication; and from carbon accounting to mitigation strategies. Moreover, the review sheds light on three future research directions: the need for generalisable lifecycle emission quantification frameworks, comparisons of the carbon reduction potential among various waste disposal technologies, and consideration of cost analysis into carbon emission quantification. This study contributes to the development of sustainable construction waste management strategies aligned with the goals of the circular economy and carbon neutrality.

AB  - Photovoltaic (PV) technologies have evolved over time for higher efficiency, with the adoption of larger wafers, passivated emitter and rear cells (PERC), and bifacial panels. The advancements in the production of PV components call for updated life cycle assessments (LCAs) of PV systems. We undertook a LCA for a utility-scale solar plant in Aotearoa New Zealand using monocrystalline silicon PERC bifacial panels, establishing the carbon, materials and energy footprint associated with the life cycle stages of the solar farm and its components. By comparing different databases for silicon processing up to the wafer slicing our results show that the GHG emissions of utility PV systems are lower (26.2 gCO2eq/kWh versus 40.4 gCO2eq/kWh), and the Energy Return on Investment (EROI) is higher (38 versus 20) when using updated databases, which reflects the advancements in the silicon processing activities. Nevertheless, the production of PV modules continues to be the greatest contributor to the life cycle GHG emissions of the utility-scale PV system (contributing to 51.6 % of the total emissions). Further recycling of the materials from the components of the solar farm reduces emissions moderately. This study underscores the significance of updating LCAs for PV systems, which provide insights for further improvements within the system and guidance for decision makers regarding the adoption of PV systems.

AB  - With the acceleration of industrialization and rapid demand growth, carbon emissions increased dramatically in China's food industry during the past two decades. However, the uncertainty of the emission level of China's food industry alongside the global supply chain restricts China from implementing more sustainable food policies. Thus, this paper first estimates the carbon footprint in China's food manufacturing industry domestically and internationally by identifying major trade partners and the corresponding industries using a multi-regional input-output model. Then, this paper further decomposed the determinants of carbon footprint change. The results show that agriculture, food industry, transport, and energy supply are primarily responsible for carbon emission growth. The structural decomposition results further demonstrate that increasing demand and consumption pattern changes are important factors leading to a growth in carbon emission, and energy efficiency improvement helps China's food industry mitigate the emission level. Finally, policy recommendations are provided based on the decomposition results.

AB  - Changes in travel behaviour are needed to tackle the climate impact associated with long-distance flights, including a switch to sustainable transport modes. In this paper, we analyse scenarios of carbon footprint reduction associated with a switch from flights to night trains for holidays in Europe for the case of Sweden, including outbound, inbound and domestic tourism. We use a prospective lifecycle assessment framework combined with results from a stated preference experiment to determine the impact of future mode shift behaviours. Our results indicate that a mode shift could be triggered by progressive night train policies resulting in (i) fewer transfers and (ii) price levels similar to those of flights. The shifts from flights to night trains could result in 9% lower cumulative carbon footprint in relation to a baseline travel demand scenario for the period 2025–2050. Decarbonization of long-distance travel in line with the Paris Agreement would likely require a combination of many different types of measures including a shift to low-carbon fuels.

This study explores the impact of GDP per capita, FDI and energy use on ecological footprint in Finland during 1990–2021 using the ARDL model and checks the existence of the Environmental Kuznets Curve. Three hypotheses were proposed and empirically tested. The long-run ARDL dynamics show that: (i) GDP negatively influences ecological footprint; (ii) FDI negatively impacts ecological footprint; (iii) energy use positively influences ecological footprint. Another result of the paper is the existence of a U-shaped Environmental Kuznets Curve between GDP and ecological footprint. The findings are deliberated along with policy implications and proposed avenues for future research.

AB  - Context
Crop residues are often returned to the soil to achieve soil carbon (C) sequestration in the agricultural sector, thereby mitigating climate change and soil degradation. However, direct straw incorporation may increase the risks of greenhouse gas (GHG) and reactive nitrogen (Nr) emissions.
Objective and methods
To comprehensively evaluate whether straw-derived biochar is a feasible alternative to straw for increasing grain yields and soil C sequestration while reducing GHG and Nr emissions in cropland, we conducted a two-factor field trial on maize farmland in northwest China during 2019–2021. Factor one comprised three straw incorporation methods (straw removal (T), total straw incorporation (S), and straw-derived biochar incorporation (B; biochar application at a straw/biochar ratio of 33%)) and factor two comprised two nitrogen (N) fertilizer application rates (0 and 300 kg ha–1). The relative benefits of the treatments for the maize productivity, net ecosystem carbon budget (NECB), carbon footprint (CF), nitrogen footprint (NF), and net ecosystem economic benefits (NEEB) were comprehensively evaluated by using the life cycle assessment (LCA) and Z-score methods.
Results
N fertilizer application was the main factor that increased maize productivity, NECB, NF, and NEEB in the maize agroecosystem. Under conventional N application, NECB increased by 244.0% (1647.37 kg C ha–1 yr–1) under SN compared with TN, and heterotrophic respiration (Rh) and N2O emissions increased by 70.3% and 34.9%, respectively. By contrast, BN increased NECB by 295.8% (1996.79 kg C ha–1 yr–1), and decreased Rh and N2O emissions by 8.2% and 20.9%, respectively. Hence, BN reduced the net global warming potential (NGWP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) of the farmland ecosystems by 56.4% (1609.49 kg CO2-eq ha–1 yr–1) and 46.5%, respectively, compared with SN. Moreover, the grain yield, water use efficiency (WUE) and N use efficiency increased significantly under BN compared with TN. Compared to SN, integrated straw-derived biochar utilization (pre-farm abatement + BN management on the farm) reduced the average CF and NF of the maize agroecosystem by 350.2% (4004.85 kg CO2-eq ha–1 yr–1) and 16.5% (12.68 kg N-eq ha–1 yr–1), respectively, and improved NEEB by $ 624.7 ha–1 yr–1.
Conclusions
Integrated straw-derived biochar utilization may be applied as a sustainable and economical straw alternative to straw for enhancing soil C sinks and reducing GHG and Nr emissions.
Implications or significance
Integrated straw-derived biochar utilization is an economically friendly and sustainable method for straw utilization in dryland maize production, and highly significant for mitigating climate and environmental degradation.

AB  - Tourism places pressures on the environment through the services provided (accommodation, food, leisure activities, and transport), meanwhile it is particularly vulnerable to global warming as climate is a crucial component of destinations’ attractiveness. As a result, research focusing on the impacts of tourism has increased significantly. Practitioners consult a plethora of frameworks and publications to environmentally assess tourism but none of the existing guidelines provides specific recommendations making difficult to obtain reliable results that can be properly replicated and compared. This paper discusses the use of Footprint family indicators in tourism through a review of studies that measure the Water, Carbon, and Ecological Footprint of tourists. Results show a lack of specific data, and an absence of consensus about the system boundaries and methodologies used for calculation. Food production and transportation are the main drivers of environmental burdens. The Footprint indicators help to understand the trade-offs between environmental effects which can be used to prioritize sustainability efforts in the tourism industry. Additionally, this study presents a critical analysis of the influence on the trip's Footprint of the services provided to different rated tourism experiences (high, medium, and low rated) and offers a reflective comparison on the pressure exerted by visitors and the local population.

AB  - Car sharing is promoted as one alternative to decrease emissions from personal transport in cities. Most emission assessments have focused on the production and use phase of car sharing, but few have focused on the impacts of changes in consumption. In this article I assess changes in the total output from various sectors and in the carbon footprint of car sharing users from a consumption perspective. This study applied a mixed top-down and bottom-up approach using scenario analysis. It is based on a detailed expenditure analysis that links changes in expenditure to variations in the total output of sectors and the carbon footprint of personal mobility using environmentally extended multi regional input and output analysis. The results show that car sharing can change the total output of several sectors, with traceable climate consequences. Variations in total outputs from sectors depend on existing national economic structures. Car sharing users who abandoned private car ownership can decrease their carbon footprint of transport by approximately 40 %. Car sharing users with a car-free lifestyle who started using car sharing for 3 % of their vehicle kilometres travelled increased their transport carbon footprint by 0.42 % to 0.70 %. Meanwhile, the rebound effects of re-spending can be as high as 70 to 85 %. This indicates that the potential carbon savings from car sharing may be drastically reduced by non-transport related consumption. Differences between the carbon footprints of business-to-consumer and peer-to-peer car sharing users were marginal.

AB  - The amendment of biochar to cropland has been recommended as a potential strategy to mitigate climate change and increase soil fertility by enhancing carbon (C) storage. Quantifying the environmental benefits and resulting carbon footprint (CF) of integrating biochar and fertilizer treatments is paramount in facing intensified human activities of agricultural land expanding under climate change, especially in fragile inland catchments for saline-alkalis soils. A three−year field experiment was conducted with maize in the Tarim River Basin to monitor greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, maize yield, soil organic carbon (SOC), and CF from 2020 to 2022. This study involved seven treatments that varied in nitrogen (N) fertilizer, irrigation, and biochar applications: (i) 0N0W (0 kg N ha−1, 0 mm, 0 t ha−1 biochar), (ii) LNLW (100 kg N ha−1, 140 mm, 0 t ha−1 biochar), (iii) LNLWB (100 kg N ha−1, 140 mm,10 t ha−1 biochar), (iv) MNMW (200 kg N ha−1, 220 mm, 0 t ha−1 biochar), (v) MNMWB (200 kg N ha−1, 220 mm, 10 t ha−1 biochar), (vi) HNHW (300 kg N ha−1, 320 mm, 0 t ha−1 biochar) (conventional treatment), and (vii) HNHWB (300 kg N ha−1, 320 mm, 10 t ha−1 biochar). The results showed that biochar amendment (LNLWB, MNMWB, HNHWB) reduced CO2 emissions by (7%, 8%, 7%), accumulative emission of CH4 and N2O (AE) (19%, 15%, 15%), greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) (32%, 24%, 22%) and CF (77%, 61%, 56%), and increased SOC sequestration (47%, 46%, 46%), maize yield (19%, 12%, 12%) compared to no biochar (LNLW, MNMW, HNHW) CO2 emission (3355, 4141, 4619 kg CO2−C ha−1), AE (148, 221, 469 kg CO2−eq ha−1), GHGI (16.3, 21.2, 40.6 kg CO2−eq t−1 yield), CF (1373, 1990, 2784 kg CO2−C ha−1), SOC (14.2, 15.1, 15.6 Mg C ha−1), maize yield (9.1, 10.6, 11.5 t ha−1). Furthermore, compared to HNHW, LNLWB reduced 32% CO2, 74% N2O, 89% CF, and increased 39% SOC. Overall, the biochar application (10 t ha−1) with reduced N (100 kg N ha−1) input in the Tarim River Basin, is a win−win strategy for reducing CF, enhancing C sequestration, and supporting stable food production, and it is a low–carbon agricultural strategy for farmland in saline−alkali soils.

AB  - Nutrition plays a key role in achieving higher crop productivity. Whereas, rainfed cropping greatly suffers due to imbalanced crop nutrition. Especially, crops like castor mostly face the utmost climatic and edaphic distress as it is predominantly cultured in poor soil of rainfed regions. Therefore, to know the performance of the rainfed castor to balanced nutrient management modules, a field experiment was conducted for two consecutive Kharif seasons in 2020 and 2021. Crop responded favorably to the balanced nutrition. We observed substantial improvement in seed yield (44%), oil yield (49%), gross return (54%), and net return (133%) with the application of the recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF) + 20 kg ZnSO4 ha−1 along with foliar spray of 2% water soluble complex fertilizer (WSCF) @ 40 days after sowing (DAS). + over soil application of RDF and 125 % RDF. Due to better crop response in terms of growth and yield, rainwater use efficiency (RWUE), partial factor productivity (PFP), and agronomic efficiency (AE) were also higher with RDF + 20 kg ZnSO4 ha−1 along with a foliar spray of 2% WSCF @ 40 DAS. Application of 125 % RDF showed enhanced energy consumption (11429 MJ ha−1). While RDF +20 kg ZnSO4 ha−1 along with a foliar spray of 2% WSCF @ 40 DAS showed 45% and 17% higher energy output compared to the RDF and 125% RDF. Due to higher energy output, the same treatment exhibited 55 and 21 % higher net energy gain over RDF and 125% RDF, respectively. As per as the carbon (C) footprint is concerned, RDF + 20 kg ZnSO4 ha−1 along with a foliar spray of 2% WSCF @ 40 DAS was observed to be slightly C expensive with 8 % higher carbon input due to higher rates of manpower and machinery utilized. However, it displayed higher C output (45%), net C gain (56%), C efficiency ratio (33%), C efficiency (37%), and C sustainability index (32%) indicating efficient C management over RDF. Overall, RDF +20 kg ZnSO4 ha−1 along with foliar spray of 2% WSCF @ 40 DAS appeared to be the productive, profitable, energy efficient, and even favorable in respect of C footprint than soil application of RDF or 125 % RDF.

AB  - This study investigates the effects of tillage and mulching regimes on rice-sweet corn systems in the lower Gangetic plains, focusing on region-specific and crop-specific impacts on soil-crop-environmental parameters. The experiment consisted of three levels of tillage: conventional (CT), minimum (MT), and zero (ZT), and four levels of mulching: live, leaf litter, paddy straw, and no mulching. The results show that ZT tillage resulted in higher bulk density (BD) compared to other treatments, despite an increase in soil organic carbon (SOC). Live and leaf litter mulching led to slight reductions in BD in the upper soil layers. CT resulted in net depletion of SOC whereas ZT registered a positive sequestration rate of 1.19 Mg ha−1 yr−1. Live and leaf litter mulching increased SOC sequestration by 42.6% and 38.8% compared to paddy straw mulching, respectively. Initially, ZT resulted in a 10.3% reduction in system productivity compared to CT, while MT yields were comparable to CT. However, mulching regimes consistently improved production by 16.4%–25.2% as compared to no mulch. ZT and MT were found to be more affordable than CT, with cost savings of 18.2% and 6.8%, respectively. ZT had the highest B: C ratio, indicating better economic efficiency. Among the mulching treatments, live mulching was the most economical. Both ZT and MT saved input energy by approximately 22.9% and 13.5%, respectively compared to CT. Live mulching resulted in the highest net energy and energy output. Compared to CT, ZT reduced carbon footprint (CF) by 41.5 and 22.2% in rice and sweet corn, respectively. MT scored midway between ZT and CT in all parameters. CT exhibited several limitations, including high input energy requirements, high cost of cultivation, poor economic efficiency, negative environmental impacts, and loss of SOC. ZT initially experienced yield reduction and lower net returns in the early years. Therefore, MT was identified as the best alternative in the initial years before transitioning completely to ZT, as it provided comparable yields to CT with better overall benefits. Among the soil cover regimes, live mulching was found to be the most favorable option across all dimensions.

AB  - China's natural resources are a major factor in its rapid financial development. In this race of development, the environment is compromised and China became the top polluted country in the world. A sustainable environment is required for sustainable development. Unlike others, we examine CO2 emissions and ecological footprint (EFP) to compare the role of natural resource rents (NRR), consumer prices (CP), financial development (FD), and population density (PD) in China. To empirically estimate the proposed linkages, the latest econometric techniques are used i. e, “Stationarity and co-integration tests with structural breaks and the autoregressive distributed lag models”. Findings report U-shaped Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) for CO2 emissions and EFP, which means GDP is helping to control CO2 emissions and EFP in China. However, natural resources, consumer prices, and population density are increasing environmental degradation. Moreover, financial development is helpful to decrease carbon emissions and ecological footprints. China needs to re-consider the policy regarding consumer prices, dense inhabitant population and use of natural resources.

AB  - Context
The medical sector has a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions which, in turn, impacts global health. In the context of the climate emergency, measures should be adopted to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the health care sector. So far, few regulations have been implemented for general practice facilities, despite the fact that the potential impact of general practice is large, due to the size of this sector. This study seeks to establish the carbon footprint of general practices in a rural French department, and to identify the main vectors of CO2 emissions.
Materials and Methods
Three general practitioners’ offices located in Lot-et-Garonne agreed to participate in this study. This retrospective study extrapolated the carbon footprint of the practices during 2020 using the ADEME BEGES method and Life Cycle Assessment. We collected data and accounting reports directly from practices regarding different potential CO2 emission sources (electricity, water, transport, waste, digital activities, stationery, and medical equipment).
Results
Medical practices emitted an average of 39.8t of CO2 equivalent in 2020, i.e. 1.5 kg of CO2eq per consultation. Transportation was the main vector of emissions with 95 % of the total (83 % via patient transportation and 12 % via physician transportation), followed by medical equipment (3 %), electricity consumption (1.1 %), office supplies (0.7 %), digital activities (0.1 %), then water and waste (both, < 0.1 %).
Conclusion
General Practice generates a significant amount of CO2 and, therefore, requires specific actions to be implemented to reduce its impact on the environment.

AB  - Climate change is one of the world's majorconcerns today.In addition to being one of the largest energy consumers, the building sector emits substantial amounts of greenhouse gases (GHGS). Globally, the building sector consumes 40% of the annual energy and emits 30% of the GHGS. The effort is therefore made throughout various phases of planning and design to measure emission levels and energy consumption concerning local climate, living culture, ecology, and construction style. To reduce Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions and energy consumption, international research is being carried out to develop a Building Information Modelling (BIM) based detection system that allows easy estimation of CO2 emissions & energy consumption. Such emissions can then be analysed quickly and objectively, and the necessary changes to support energy-efficient design can be implemented. The study focused on the initial stages of design because choices made at this time determine a large portion of a building's life cycle effects and cannot easily be changed afterwards.

AB  - Tourism is very vulnerable to climate change and the disruption of Covid-19, facing two challenges: fighting climate change pursuing its carbon emissions goals, and recovering from the complex pandemic effects. We contribute to the incomplete understanding of tourism emissions pandemic impact and in different post-covid recovery scenarios. Using official data on tourists' consumption, we calculate the carbon footprint of tourism in Spain in 2019 and 2020 under different recovery pathways, including changes in consumption patterns and emissions efficiency, using a multiregional input-output model. Results show that the carbon footprint of tourism in Spain fell by 63% in 2020 compared to pre-pandemic levels, which would be aligned with the current sectoral decarbonisation target. However, the new tourists’ consumption patterns resulting from the pandemic are insufficient to increase tourism sustainability if they imply pre-pandemic consumption levels. The results provide empirical ground for the binary debate on “recovery or reform”.

AB  - Energy flow and environmental impacts are crucial factors in sustainable agriculture. Field experiments were conducted to evaluate the energy consumption, economic benefits and carbon footprint (CF) of Japonica rice (JR) and indica rice (IR) cropping systems. The results showed that the JR system could provide favourable income combined with improved yields compared to those of the IR system, with growth rates of 47.0 % and 9.8 %, respectively. Fertilizer application, diesel fuel, and machinery were the major contributors to energy consumption regardless of the system. Compared to those of the IR system, the JR system attained a higher energy consumption, mainly resulting from seeds and fertilizers, reducing the average energy use efficiency by 5.6 %. There was no significant difference in the average eco-efficiency between the two cropping systems. Although the JR system exhibited a greater carbon input (941.2 kg CO2-eq ha−1) than that of the IR system (828.7 kg CO2-eq ha−1), it exhibited a comparable CF per unit of rice production due to its greater output. These results suggest that adopting the JR system could be a promising alternative for increasing grain production without increasing environmental costs in China. Applying innovative fertilization methods or products, efficient machinery will help achieve high productivity and environmental friendliness.

AB  - The impact of environment-friendly technology on environment quality is an unsettled debate having generated more heat than light. Given this context, the study explores the impact of environment-friendly on ecological footprints using the Environmental Kuznets Curve framework. Utilizing Panel Autoregressive Distributive Lag model for aggregate ecological footprint doesn't show the evidence of environment-friendly technology improving environmental quality. However, disaggregated analysis reveals significant reductions in footprints related to Built-up, Crop, Fishing Grounds, and Grazing lands, with positive impacts observed on Forest and Carbon footprints. We also estimate the turning points of per capita income, confirming heterogeneous and footprint-specific Kuznets curves. Notably, we show that environment-friendly technology plays a crucial role in delaying depletion in Built-up land and contracting the depletion phase of Fishing Grounds along the Kuznets curve trajectory. The study, therefore, underscores the importance of environment-friendly technology in addressing environmental challenges and promoting environmental sustainability.

The paper considers the Panel-corrected Standard Errors (PCSEs) and the Dynamic Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) estimations to empirically validate the hypothesis. The findings from different estimation techniques indicate that government efficiency reduces the ecological footprint. However, green technology raises the ecological footprint. Other indicators, such as the institutions' voice of accountability, control of corruption, and regulatory policy, do not significantly affect the ecological footprint. Therefore, the governments of the BRICS economies should encourage government efficiency by substituting cleaner energy and hydrogen economies in natural resources to achieve a net-zero emissions target by 2050.

AB  - This work investigates mitigating the carbon footprint in Jordan by altering the travel patterns of the population. This goal can be accomplished by creating a new tourist destination that has a marine environment, similar to overseas destinations. Based on recent data, it is estimated that half a million Jordanians would prefer a domestic destination instead of traveling abroad, provided that it has a marine environment. This shift in travel preferences would result in an estimated reduction of 320,000 tons of CO2 emissions every year. The proposed new destination is an artificial lake created in the Jafer basin, located in southeastern Jordan. The area has a natural depression that is suitable for this purpose. The proposal involves excavating a 140 km-long tunnel connecting the Gulf of Aqaba to the Jafer basin, where seawater is pumped into the basin to create the lake, with a water volume of 2000 MCM. The design is based on keeping the water's level steady in the lake. The proposed design is shown to be feasible, with an optimal tunnel diameter of 4 m, excavated at constant depth. In order to maintain a uniform water pressure, 15 pumping stations should be installed along the tunnel. The total cost of the project is estimated at 5.5 B$. This cost is not only used for mitigating carbon footprint but also for increasing the real estate value of the area around the lake, and a more healthy distribution of population in the country.

AB  - China, being a significant agricultural country and the world's greatest carbon emitter, is today faced with the combined problems of improving agricultural economic quality and reducing carbon emissions, all while dealing with resource constraints. Exploring the nexus and internal mechanism between agricultural carbon footprint (CF), energy utilization and economic quality thereby implies practical significance. For these reasons, the current study intends to explore the nexus and internal mechanism between agricultural CF, energy utilization, and economic qualities of main grain-planting provinces in China. Multi-approaches like, Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model, the Granger Causality Test based on the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), and Impulse Response and Variance Decomposition (IRVD) methods, and a time-series data in the duration from 1997 to 2019 are employed. The findings indicate that: 1) Agricultural CF, energy utilization and economic quality demonstrate an increasing trend; 2) There exists environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) in agricultural CF in China's main grain-planting provinces; 3) Energy utilization negatively influenced agricultural CF in both the short-term and long-term; 4) In the short-term and long-term, a bidirectional causality exist among agricultural CF and economic quality, as well as a unidirectional causality from energy utilization to agricultural CF and economic quality.

AB  - Carbon footprint analysis has been used as a well-known indicator to study the carbon dioxide emissions of organisations and productions. Although various studies and approaches are developed, none focus on news broadcasting organisations. Therefore, the carbon footprint of such organisations and carbon emission reduction strategies are not well understood. This lack of knowledge potentially undermines such organisations' sustainability and blocks their contribution to the higher level sustainability goals. To address this gap, for the first time, this study aims to explore and quantify the carbon footprint of news broadcasting organisations. The current study took Nieuwsuur, a Dutch news broadcasting organisation, as a case study. The results demonstrated that the news broadcasting organisation emits 235.28 t of CO2eq yearly. The study categorised the CO2 emissions into five main categories, namely: (i) travel and transport, (ii) office and studio, (iii) accommodation, (iv) materials, and (v) waste, which for each of them sub-categories have been defined and studied. Travel and transport contributed the most to the carbon footprint of such organisations. Within this category, air travel has the most significant share (27 % of total emissions), which cannot be mitigated due to the nature of news broadcasting organisations. In contrast, commuter travel and outsourced travel (together with 37.6 % of total emissions) have considerable potential for reducing carbon emissions. The following categories are office and studio, with 20.7 % of total emissions and materials, with 4.9 % of total emissions. The study recommended that working from home and outsourcing from sustainable companies are the easiest and most effective carbon reduction strategies. Other emissions reduction strategies are discussed for each category, and recommendations are provided.

AB  - Guaranteeing a robust supply of vegetables is a significant public welfare endeavor. However, the implementation of irrational water and fertilizer regimes in greenhouse vegetable fields (GVF) has resulted in adverse environmental impacts. Therefore, it is crucial to develop water and fertilizer regimes to maintain the productivity of greenhouse vegetables with less carbon (C) and reactive nitrogen (Nr) footprint. A four growing seasons experiment involving the cultivation of cucumbers and tomatoes was conducted in the suburbs of Beijing. The experiment comprised three treatments: flood irrigation with a conventional urea-N application (FN), drip fertigation with a conventional urea-N application (DN), and drip fertigation with a 50% reduction of urea-N application (DRN). The results showed that about 70% of annual N inputs in GVF were surplus, posing a high risk of loss. For the FN treatment, the N budget, Nr loss, Nr footprint per unit of vegetable yield (NrFY), Nr footprint per unit of net return (NrFR), greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, C footprint per unit of vegetable yield (CFY), C footprint per unit of net return (CFR) were respectively quantified as follows: 1653 kg N ha−1 yr−1, 776 kg N ha−1 yr−1, 4.39 kg N t−1 yr−1, 24.48 kg N ¥10000−1 yr−1, 46548 kg CO2-eq ha−1 yr−1, 262.98 kg CO2-eq t−1 yr−1 and 1467.58 kg CO2-eq ¥10000−1 yr−1. Compared with FN, DN significantly reduced Nr loss (25%), NrFY (24%), NrFR (22%), GHG emissions (6%), CFY (4%), while it increased N surplus (9.7%) and produced lower farmers' net return (¥ 13486 ha−1 yr−1). Concurrently, DRN significantly reduced the N surplus, Nr loss, NrFY and NrFR by ∼35%, decreased the GHG emissions, CFY and CFR by ∼20%, and improved farmers' net return by ¥ 674 ha−1 yr−1 compared to FN treatment. Therefore, this study highlighted that an integrated water and fertilizer regulation strategy (drip irrigation replacing flood irrigation coupled with a 50% reduction in chemical N application) can simultaneously achieve environmental and economic benefits in the context of high N inputs. This contributes to the sustainable development of intensive vegetable cultivation systems.

AB  - The carbon footprint of rural household consumption in China has a substantial scale and unique characteristics compared to urban areas. However, there remains a lack of studies that clarify the sources and potential of rural household carbon footprint in China. In this study, we estimated the rural household carbon footprint of 30 provinces in China’s mainland in 2007, 2012, and 2017 based on the Multi-Regional Input-Output model, and investigated the transition patterns with a consideration of the trends, regional differences, driving forces, and structural changes. Results revealed that the carbon footprint of rural household consumption in China grew by 83% from 2007 to 2017 and displayed a weak decoupling from income growth. The transition patterns were observed from three perspectives: Firstly, the primary driving force behind the growth was income increase, while the decrease in carbon footprint intensity slowed down the growth significantly. Secondly, housing and direct emission contributed to 62% of the growth in rural household carbon footprint, while health care, transportation, and other services showed increasing contributions. Lastly, there were notable “higher in the north, lower in the south” regional differences in the per capita rural household carbon footprint, and the gap tended to increase. The main reasons for the regional differences were intensity change, income increase, housing consumption, and direct emission. Our findings can offer decision-making support to guide rural household consumption towards achieving carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals.

AB  - In the global effort to mitigate climate change and reduce CO2 emissions, this study introduces an innovative, pioneering approach that combines artificial intelligence and experimental methods to investigate the CO2 footprint (CO2-FP) in fly ash geopolymer concrete materials. Three powerful non-linear intelligent learners, including Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with Response Surface Methodology (RSM), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Standalone Decision Tree Regression (DTR) are employed. The models are developed using seven input features related to the curing temperature, fly ash content, concentrations of coarse and fine aggregates, alkaline activators (Na2SiO3, NaOH) content, and superplasticizer. To identify the most influential input features, three different combinations (combo-1, combo-2, and combo-3) of these features are utilized in model building. The models' performance is assessed using key metrics such as coefficient of correlation (CC), Nash Sutcliffe coefficient efficiency (NSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). During the verification phase, the GPR-3 [Combo-3] model emerges as the most efficient in predicting the CO2-FP, with a high CC value of 0.9645 and NSE value of 0.9292. Consistently, Combo-3 demonstrates superior performance across all the models, underscoring the significance of the selected features. The findings of this study provide valuable guidance to industries and policymakers, enabling them to optimize concrete compositions and minimize CO2 emissions, thus contributing to global environmental sustainability.

AB  - The goal of this research was to quantify the energy demand and carbon footprint over the life cycle, along with the financial cost, of sewage treatment with the recovery of dissolved methane (d-CH4). The sewage treatment is composed of pre-treatment, followed by treatment in upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors, trickling filter and secondary decanter, post-treatment with disinfection, and biogas recovery in the three-phase separator of the UASB reactor. The methods used in this study were attributional life cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis – LCA and TEA, respectively. The energy demand, carbon footprint and financial cost for 1 m3 sewage treatment in the evaluated scenario without d-CH4 recovery (S1) were 3.4 MJ, 1.7 kg CO2eq and 0.17 USD respectively, while those with d-CH4 recovery (S2) varied by 12%, −16% and 2.3% compared to S1. The produced biogas for lower heating value in S2 (2.6 MJ) was 27% higher than that in S1 (2.0 MJ) and this varied from 1.3 MJ to 4.6 MJ in the scenarios for different influent chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the sewage treatment plant (STP) and COD removal efficiency in the UASB reactor. The highest eco-efficiency for 1 MJ heat production from the STP biogas was achieved in the scenario with d-CH4 recovery, higher influent COD, higher COD removal efficiency in the UASB reactor, d-CH4 saturation, photovoltaic electricity supply, and a higher energy efficiency in d-CH4 recovery combined (S2,COD+,R+,S,PV,EE+), which reduced the energy demand by 55%, carbon footprint by 66% and financial cost by 63% compared to S1. Furthermore, the STP functionality change from a single-product (biogas) to a multi-product (biogas, water for reuse and biosolid fertilizer) approach (S1,WR, BF and S2,WR,BF) made the biogas a competitive product compared to those from fossil sources. Therefore, resource recovery from the sewage treatment in higher influent COD, higher COD removal efficiency, the use of a more efficient, clean and economical electricity source and higher energy efficiency in d-CH4 recovery in a multi-product STP contribute to achieving the energy self-sufficiency over the life cycle while reducing the carbon footprint and financial cost of its products.

AB  - To improve the farming efficiency, Egypt has been struggling to narrow the water, energy, and yield gaps owing to exacerbated water shortage. For quantitative diagnosis of farming performance, the paper presented an on-farm water, energy, food, and carbon-footprint (WEFC) nexus index made up of four equally pillars. The arithmetic average preserved the multi-centric approach and equal importance of the four pillars. The index was applied to test and rank 2,042 wheat-based farmer fields in Egypt representing diverse inputs, agronomic and irrigation practices, soil types, and agroecological conditions. The water metric was the ratio of saved water, difference between maximum water consumption recorded in the country and actual water consumption, to the maximum water consumption. Likewise, the energy metric was obtained. The food metric was the ratio of actual yield to maximum yield in the country. The carbon-footprint metric was the ratio of difference between maximum CO2 emission in the country and actual emission to the maximum emission. The index values showed a wide range from 18.69% to 87.33% with a high standard deviation emphasizing the diversity of farming practices, soil types, and agroecological conditions. The highest ten values were recorded in fields with sandy soils, relatively large area, drip irrigation, recommended seeding and fertilization rates, well drainage, weeds removal, and tillage. The drip irrigation system in 51 out of 52 fields had above average value. The lowest ten values were in fields with clay soils and flood irrigation, where 18.7% of 1,780 fields exceeded the above average value. Raised beds with furrow irrigation in 83.15% of 184 fields exceeded the above average value. Fertilization rates of nitrogen and phosphorus in 61% and 53% of fields respectively exceeded the recommended rates with no significant reflection on the food metric. The low index values in fields with flood irrigation were attributed to high water losses causing high water consumption, energy consumption, and CO2 emission. The index was a good indicative of input resources consumption and output production as it varied inversely with water and energy consumption and CO2 emission and proportionally with yield. Since the high-water consumption was the main entry point for low index values in fields with flood irrigation, changing the irrigation to drip system or revisiting the irrigation scheduling and the estimated applied irrigation water amount were recommended. The index can be utilized to quantify the effectiveness of both recommendations and further new site-specific interventions and to assess their impact at scale. The index also recommended land use consolidation where farmers retain ownership of their lands but with cooperative farming.

AB  - Kerbs play an important role in providing structural support to the road. The compressive strength of concrete is often the only design consideration. Premature kerb failure is common indicating that only considering compressive strength in design may not be sufficient. Flexural/bending strength, deflection capacity, impact resistance, water absorption/sorption, abrasion resistance, and freeze-thaw resistance can also be important. The use of recycled products in concrete has been an active area of research in recent years and concrete produced from recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) and tyre-derived aggregate (TDA) could be a cleaner and more sustainable alternative to conventional concrete. In this study, ten different concrete mixes were developed for a target strength of 25 MPa and tested for mechanical and durability properties. Significant variations in the mechanical properties of different concrete were observed despite all concrete having similar compressive strength. The addition of TDA was found to improve flexural strength, deflection, and abrasion resistance properties, however, it led to inferior impact resistance and higher shrinkage compared to control concrete. A carbon footprint analysis showed that the use of 100% RCA (replacing natural aggregates) could drastically reduce the carbon footprint of concrete. For concrete with TDA aggregate, some environmental benefits of recycling TDA may get offset by the additional binder requirement to achieve the desired compressive strength.

AB  - Cropping system diversification under integrated nutrient management is an important tool for enhancing crop productivity, maintaining soil nutrient and energy balance while restoring environmental quality and sustainability. A field experiment was conducted for seven consecutive cycles with three rice-based cropping systems (C1: rice-mustard-jute; C2: rice-wheat-maize+greengram; C3: rice-lentil-sesame) under multiple irrigated conditions and four nutrient management practices (NPK fertilizers and biogas slurry (BGS) in various combinations). Comprehensive assessment of system productivity as well as sustainability, nutrient balance, energy and carbon footprint (CF) of different cropping systems under the influence of inorganic-organic fertilization were analysed to know the possible environmental impact. Irrespective of the cropping systems, the highest system rice equivalent yield (REY) (7.78 t ha−1) was recorded with 100% NPK fertilizers, whereas, substitution of chemical fertilizers with BGS for supplying a part of N, P and K requirement of different crops in the cropping system resulted in higher sustainable yield index (SYI). Positive apparent soil N and P balance were observed irrespective of cropping systems and nutrient management practices, however, the soils under all the treatments suffered an apparent loss of K. The rice-wheat-maize+green gram (C2) system dominated in terms of productivity and soil fertility, over the others, whereas substitution of NPK fertilizers by BGS resulted in a significant increase of available N, P, K, S, B and cationic micronutrient (Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn) content in the soil over 100% NPK fertilizers. However, sole application of BGS resulted in higher build-up of soil organic carbon. The energy ratio was higher in the rice-mustard-jute cropping system with 100% NPK fertilizers application (6.57 and 6.13 kg MJ−1 respectively) due to higher energy output to input balance, however, the specific energy was higher in the rice-lentil-sesame system with sole BGS application (6.13 and 6.25 kg MJ−1 respectively). In contrast to the C output and carbon footprint (CF), the carbon sustainability index (CSI) was reported highest in the rice-mustard-jute system (12.28) while the lowest was recorded in the rice-wheat-maize+green gram system (9.14). Therefore, legume inclusive cropping along with organic nutrient sources could be considered as an effective option to maintain crop productivity, soil nutrients and energy balance while reducing carbon footprints in the areas where intensive cultivation is predominated.

AB  - Identifying the main drivers of the household carbon footprint (HCF) is a priority to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and move towards a more sustainable economy. Among the multiple factors that explain the HCF, some previous research has confirmed the relevance of gender. In this paper, we calculate the HCF of individual Spanish households using an environmentally extended multi-regional input-output model (EEMRIO) that quantifies the emissions embedded in the supply chain of goods and services that households consume. We assess the differences in consumption and emissions patterns, measuring the gender effect by a new variable, the female share of the household. This represents a remarkable improvement over previous literature that used simpler approaches. Moreover, we assess the partial effect of gender on HCF using multivariate regressions for total and sectoral emissions. Our results show that households with a majority of men have a higher HCF and carbon intensity. Even when controlling for economic, sociodemographic, and regional factors there are differences in the sectoral emissions according to gender. Female households spend more (and generate more emissions) on housing and food products, while male households show that pattern for restaurants and transport. These results can help orientate environmental campaigns and demand-side mitigation policies.

AB  - An accurate assessment of carbon footprint is one of the key elements to evaluate progress towards sustainable development. Although, recent studies have extensively analyzed carbon footprint, the scientific contribution related to universities and higher education institutes requires further consideration. The current study provides a detailed integrative review of universities’ carbon footprint to provide contextual information and novel findings. Our novel review strategy allows us to report thematic analysis, co-citation analysis, research collaboration analysis, and methodological and topical contribution. As policymakers prioritize sustainable development, we allow them to understand different dynamics of academic institutions’ carbon footprint and report policy suggestions to improve it. As any change at higher research institutions has a wider impact on society in general, it is our opinion that developing sustainable university campuses also has implications for future research, management practices and compliance with sustainable development goals.

AB  - Comprehending the intricate dynamics between oil consumption and environmental factors is imperative for developing effective and sustainable resource management policies. This study utilizes panel data from 1996 to 2022 and sophisticated analytical techniques, including the Method of Moments Quantile Regression (MMQR) and Canay (2011b) quantile regression. Two models have been employed; the first incorporates carbon emissions, while the second integrates ecological footprint considerations. The results indicate a positive association between oil consumption and economic growth concerning carbon emissions and ecological footprint. Conversely, an adverse effect is observed for renewable energy, showing a mitigating impact on both carbon emissions and ecological footprint. Additionally, the study reveals a positive correlation between institutional quality and carbon emissions, with a contrasting negative effect of institutional quality on the ecological footprint at lower quantiles. A positive correlation is found between institutional quality and ecological footprint at the upper quantiles. This study advocates for an integrated resources policy that strategically incorporates renewable energy to mitigate carbon emissions and ecological footprint. Recognizing the significant influence of institutional quality on environmental outcomes, the findings underscore the importance of aligning economic development with environmental stewardship. This approach ensures a sustainable and resilient energy future, contributing to a harmonized and responsible utilization of resources. Highlighting the role of oil consumption and renewables, this study emphasizes the critical integration of institutional quality into resource policies. The alignment of these policies with Sustainable Development Goals is advocated for a sustainable and resilient energy future.

AB  - Environmental impact evaluation of buildings is critical for further analysis and optimization of pig farms for sustainable pork production. This study is the first attempt to quantify the carbon and water footprints of a standard intensive pig farm building using building information modeling (BIM) and operation simulation model. The model was constructed with carbon emission and water consumption coefficients, and a database was built. The results showed that the operational stage of pig farm accounted for most of the carbon footprint (49.3–84.9 %) and water footprint (65.5–92.5 %). Building materials production ranked second in carbon (12.0–42.5 %) and water footprints (4.4–24.9 %), and pig farm maintenance ranked third in carbon (1.7–5.7 %) and water footprints (0.7–3.6 %). Notably, the mining and production stages of building materials contributed the largest carbon and water footprints of pig farm construction. Masonry materials have a significant impact on the overall carbon and water footprints of the pig farm. Pig farm using aerated concrete could reduce 41.1 % of the total carbon footprint and 58.9 % of the total water footprint compared to that using coal gangue sintered brick and autoclaved fly ash brick. This study presented a BIM-enabled method for carbon and water footprint analysis of pig farms and illustrated how the model can be used to facilitate the low carbon design of agricultural buildings.

AB  - In light of the SDG goals, carbon emissions from different food and food-related products have been under serious scrutiny in recent years. Despite the increasing awareness of global warming and the carbon footprint issue, food culture in different societies is difficult to change. Food production and storage are related to food security. The assessment of food-related carbon footprint should be linked with the chain of food lines rather than food items per se. It is obvious that much of the carbon emission is contributed by the production of it, packaging, storage, transportation, modification, quality control, and other related logistics. Therefore, this research investigated the correlation between food consumption and carbon footprint in the two types of diets and different populated regions. A systematic literature review combined with a bibliometric analysis approach was taken to construct the discussion. It studied the sources of carbon footprint and the life cycle of daily diet consumption and compared the carbon footprint of animal and plant-based diets. An evaluation of carbon footprint from various dietary patterns in India, China, and Italy was qualitatively carried out based on the published data in different scientific databases, and quantified values were discussed. Animal-based protein diets, especially meat, were found to have a higher contribution of carbon footprint; rice, however, contributes the highest among the plant-based diets. The bibliometric analysis pointed to the academic engagement on food-related carbon footprint issues across the globe and the scope of improvement. This review will help researchers to construct a thematic framework, and policymakers reorient the policy implementation.

AB  - Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions are growing at an accelerated pace and can generate several environmental, social and economic problems. Because of this, Educational Institutions (IE) are taking a leading role in the development and implementation of sustainable practices and initiatives, recognizing their potential to accelerate this progress towards sustainable development. The objective was to develop GHG emission indices and the carbon footprint of the Federal University of Viçosa, Viçosa campus, in the base period of 2019 and also the potential for compensation through the removal of carbon from the native forests existing at the university. In the base period, UFV emitted a total of 3492.46 MgCO2e. When considering the existing tree vegetation, it was found that the removal was 8547.76 MgCO2e, making the carbon balance negative, with a balance of 5055.30 MgCO2e. The emission index per total area was 2.13 MgCO2e.ha−1. year−1, the emission index per constructed area was 81.03 MgCO2e.ha−1. year−1, and the carbon footprint was 0.19 MgCO2e.person−1. year−1. It is concluded that the carbon balance is negative, indicating that the removal of carbon is greater than the emission of GHG. With the results obtained, UFV can promote green marketing and become an example for other Brazilian and worldwide IE.

AB  - China has a large fastest-aging population, which would reshape household consumption patterns and influence global CO2 emissions. This study examines global CO2 emissions driven by household consumption (i.e., household carbon footprints, HCFs) of 34 age groups in China's 30 provinces and uncovers relevant socioeconomic influencing factors. Results show that China's population aging (i.e., the proportion of the elderly population) is conducive to global CO2 emission reduction during 2011–2014. This trend is mainly due to the relatively lower per capita HCFs of the elderly (1.7 t in 2014). In contrast, the per capita HCFs of the youth group are higher (3.3 t in 2014), mainly affected by the large expenditure on residence and transportation & communication. In addition, the HCFs of all age groups have increased during 2011–2014. Per capita expenditure is the most significant driver of this increase. The decline in CO2 emission intensity makes the largest contribution to reducing the HCFs of the youth group. For the aged group, expenditure structure change is the largest contributor to HCFs reduction. These findings reveal the differentiated impacts of China's household consumption by age on global CO2 emissions. This study lays the scientific foundation for deriving amelioration policies and achieving emission reduction targets in the process of population aging.

AB  - ABSTRACT
The sludge from wastewater treatment systems (WWTS) contains a high quantity of organic material with great potential for synthesising bio-based chemicals and materials that can replace their fossil-based equivalents. Herein, we have investigated the upcycling of WWTS to the production of bio-based crotonic acid (), which is in turn used in replacement of the commercial, fossil-based in the copolymerization with vinyl acetate to poly(vinyl acetate-co-crotonic acid). The results demonstrate that a great benefit in terms of GHG emission reduction is obtained when the fossil-based synthesis is replaced with the WWTS-to- route, decreasing the carbon footprint of from 13.9 to 7.75 kg CO2 per kg . The copolymers constituted from fossil-based or bio-based have the same composition and thermal properties, independently of the origin and the purity of the starting monomer, suggesting their equivalency for the investigated application.

AB  - Economic policy uncertainty is an evolving area of research that may affect environmental issues such as the carbon footprint. However, from a global perspective, it is not known whether economic policy uncertainty is significantly related to it. Motivated by this gap in the literature, we investigate the impact of economic policy uncertainty on carbon footprint. Using a sample of 2782 firms from 60 countries, our cross-sectional regression analysis finds that economic policy uncertainty is positively associated with the carbon footprint. This applies to the total, direct, and indirect carbon emissions measurements. However, we find that countries with better institutional governance alleviate the significant association between economic policy uncertainty and carbon footprint.

AB  - The long-run effect of the synergy between natural resource consumption and environmental sustainability varies across countries depending on the economic structure. However, the transboundary effect of natural resource capital underscores the importance of environmental convergence. Here, we map ecological performance, biocapacity, and carbon footprint of nations. We assess the socio-economic drivers of environmental performance and convergence using novel cross-country time series techniques. We find that the expansion of biocapacity of nations has an ameliorating effect on ecological performance. The hotspot countries of environmental performance include Australia, Brazil, China, Germany, India, Japan, Russia, and the US. We confirm the existence of environmental convergence across nations — implying that the disparity in carbon and ecological footprint between higher-income and lower-income countries will converge in the long-run. This accentuates the need for global partnership towards achieving environmental sustainability.

AB  - When compared to traditional fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies represent a small, but growing, fraction of financial transactions. The rapid growth of cryptocurrencies has raised concerns regarding the environmental impact of this energy-intensive type of currency. In this study, water and carbon footprints associated with cryptocurrencies are assessed. These environmental footprints are then compared to the water and carbon footprints associated with conventional currencies, which is a novelty of this study. A spatially refined, bottom-up analysis of the most energy-intensive aspects of each financial system is used in the comparison of these systems. Specifically, the energy use for printing money, bank branches, automated teller machines (ATM), and cashless transactions is evaluated at the country level and compared to the energy use of crypto mining around the world. Cryptocurrencies’ electricity use of 236 × 106 megawatt hours (MWh) in 2021 surpassed that of the conventional transaction system, despite cryptocurrencies representing less than 0.5% of global cashless financial transactions. In terms of its water footprint, cryptocurrencies have an annual water consumption of 3670 × 106 cubic meters (m3). Cryptocurrencies' water footprint is more than double that of conventional currencies because crypto mining takes place in countries with higher water intensities for electricity. Crypto mining activities are also estimated to result in almost 139 × 106 tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) of global greenhouse gas emissions. While cryptocurrencies represent a small percentage of financial transactions, their environmental impact is much larger than the conventional financial transaction system. This study shows how regulatory changes, such as the 2021 crypto mining ban in China, and crypto mining location can have implications on the environmental footprint associated with cryptocurrency.

AB  - We estimate the causal effect of carbon footprint labels on individual food choices and quantify potential carbon emission reductions, using data from a large-scale field experiment at five university cafeterias with over 80,000 individual meal choices. Results show that carbon footprint labels led to a decrease in the probability of selecting a high-carbon footprint meal by approximately 2.7 percentage points with consumers substituting to mid-carbon impact meals. We find no change in the market share of low-carbon meals, on average. The reduction in high-carbon footprint meals is driven by decreases in sales of meat meals while sales of mid-ranged vegan, vegetarian and fish meals all increased. We estimate that the introduction of carbon footprint labels was associated with a 4.3% reduction in average carbon emissions per meal. We contrast our findings with those from nudge-style interventions and discuss the cost-effectiveness of carbon footprint labels. Our results suggest that carbon footprint labels present a viable and low-cost policy tool to address information failure and harness climatarian preferences to encourage more sustainable food choices.

AB  - This study aimed to quantify greenhouse gas emissions derived from the production-consumption of rice in Hubei—a major rice-producing province in central China. This research employed primary and secondary data collection methods. Primary data sources included interviews and experimental observations from seven counties in Hubei collected from June 2016 to December 2016. Secondary data sources—including national datasets, inter-governmental reports, and peer-reviewed articles—were used to extract relevant data, such as emission factors, and national and provincial rice output. Life Cycle Assessment was employed to build a comprehensive inventory and map of the rice carbon footprint, including the following five stages: production inputs, farm management, growth period, processing and sale, and consumption. Uncertainty analysis was performed to validate the reliability of carbon footprint estimations. Results showed that the carbon footprint for every 1 ton of polished rice in Hubei ranged between 4.19–6.81 t CO2e/t and was 5.39 t CO2e/t on average. Greenhouse gas emissions were primarily produced from rice fields during the growth stage (over 60% of greenhouse gas emissions of the whole life cycle of rice), followed by the consumption stage, and the production and transportation of agricultural inputs. Uncertainty analysis estimations indicated acceptable levels of reliability. This study's results indicate that the production and consumption of rice is a significant contributor to agricultural carbon emissions in Hubei—consistent with national estimates that place China as the largest carbon dioxide emitter globally. This research provides further insight into future policies and targeted initiatives for the efficient use of low-carbon agricultural inputs for rice production and consumption stages in China.

AB  - Understanding all the possible greenhouse gas (GHG) emission sources and factors is key to achieving net zero emissions by 2050, as targeted by the Paris Agreement, and thereby, averting the severe consequences of climate change. In this study, we explored household energy-related GHG (HEGHG) emissions in 265 residential neighbourhoods in a high-latitude city that experiences opposite temperature extremes. Our results revealed that the average annual per capita GHG emissions from dwellings in the city are 45% higher than those from personal transportation, highlighting the urgent need for greater emphasis on reducing GHG emissions from dwellings in high-latitude cities. We found that per capita floor area is positively correlated with GHG emissions. The findings also indicate that per capita HEGHG emissions significantly increase with increasing neighbourhood income levels (r = 0.8). An increase in the percentage of households struggling to afford homeownership is also associated with a decrease in HEGHG emissions (r = -0.3). These findings can help facilitate the focus on areas of high-latitude cities where the mitigation measures may have the most impact in reducing carbon footprint.

We enhance understanding of the climate change action of SMEs by taking into account the mediating mechanisms (i.e., identification of green barriers and green networking) through which firm entrepreneurial energy efficiency orientation leads to superior carbon footprint reduction initiatives by overcoming barriers to green practices. A survey of 252 SME owners and top managers in the Tees Valley region, Northeast England, supported the direct impact of entrepreneurial energy efficiency orientation on overcoming barriers to green practices and the mediating role of identification of green barriers and green networking in this focal relationship. These findings reveal the importance of entrepreneurial energy efficiency orientation, identification of green barriers and green networking in helping SMEs overcome barriers to green practices and improving carbon footprint reduction initiatives.

AB  - ABSTRACT
Indian dairy enterprise is dominated by smallholder dairy farms that contribute 72% of the country's total milk production. These smallholder dairy farms are often considered to emit substantial greenhouse gases (GHG) but are poor in productive performances. Therefore, it is crucial to estimate the carbon footprint (CF) of milk production of the smallholder Indian dairy farms. The primary objectives of the study were (1) Assessing the CF of milk production of smallholder dairy farms through life cycle analysis in south-interior Karnataka, India; (2) Identifying the hotspots of GHG emissions and significant factors influencing the CF of milk production in smallholder dairy production system. The study accounted GHG emissions from different sources and considered multiple functions of the smallholder production system. Estimations were made based on primary data collected from 47 farms and associated secondary data. For estimating the CF of milk production, the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) on a CO2-equivalent (CO2-eq) basis from feed production, enteric fermentation, manure management, transport and energy usage were allocated to fat- and protein-corrected milk (FPCM) based on mass balance, price (crop byproducts and residues) and feed digestibility. Principal component analysis and stepwise linear regression analysis were performed to identify the major factors influencing the CF. The average total GHG emissions (kg CO2-eq yr−1 farm−1) attributable to milk production based on mass, economic, and digestibility allocations were 8,936, 8,641, and 8,759, respectively. The contributions of CH4, N2O, and CO2 to the total farm GHG emission were 70.6%, 20.5%, and 7.69%, respectively. The major emission hotspots were CH4 emission from enteric fermentation (66.8%) and GHG emission from feed production (23.0%). The average CF of cradle-to-dairy cooperative milk production varied from 1.45 to 1.81 kg CO2-eq kg FPCM−1. The CF of milk production was more than 2-fold greater, when milk yield was below 3,500 kg lactating cow−1 yr−1. The FPCM yield 100 kg body weight−1, dry matter intake, and CH4 emission from manure management were the strongest determinants of the CF and explained 83.4% of the observed variation. The study emphasized the importance of considering multiple functions of a mixed crop-livestock-based dairy production system for estimating CF per unit of product. The results suggest that maintaining high-yielding dairy animals and adopting appropriate feeding strategies for better feed utilization are the possible effective interventions for reducing the CF of milk production.

AB  - Farmland circulation will lead to the modernization and large-scale development of agricultural production, which reduces the carbon footprint of agricultural cultivation. Based on the microscopic perspective of farmers, this research uses the data from the Fixed Observation Points of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs in China in 2009 to 2015 and examines the impact of farmland circulation on the carbon footprint of agricultural cultivation using the fixed-effect model. In addition, heterogeneity analysis is conducted. The results show that farmland circulation has an impact on the carbon footprint of agricultural cultivation. Specifically, the transferred farmland significantly reduces the carbon footprint while there are heterogeneities in the effect of farmland circulation on the carbon footprint of agricultural cultivation due to the different regions or the variable education levels of the head of households.

AB  - This study employs Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares, Common Correlated Effects and Dumitrescu-Hurlin panel causality techniques to investigate the environmental impacts of nuclear energy generation in European Union countries from 1990 to 2022. The ongoing debate within the European Union and the empirical contradictions in the literature, coupled with the overall singular-dimensionality surrounding the impacts of nuclear energy on the environment, necessitate a broader and comprehensive examination of its effects across various environmental dimensions. These dimensions include the presence of CO2 emissions and the ecological footprint generated. The findings reveal that nuclear energy adoption by countries tends to affect CO2 emissions but this relationship goes from CO2 to nuclear energy consumption as per the causality test, while the ecological footprint variable does not exhibit a causal relationship with nuclear energy consumption. We estimated that a higher presence of air pollutants promotes the generation of nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuel energy sources. The study highlights that while nuclear energy generation produces no air pollution, it does impose significant land use requirements, potentially leading to ecosystem degradation. Factors such as uranium extraction, nuclear waste management, disposal, and accidents contribute to this impact. Further research is needed to understand the specific mechanisms and factors contributing to the observed environmental degradation associated with nuclear energy generation.

AB  - Understanding the trends and the peak of metal consumption of a society is essential for responding to environmental and climate challenges, considering the significant pollution and carbon emissions from metal production and consumption. In this study, we focus on China, the largest metal consumer globally, to explore the evolutionary patterns, driving forces, and the peak stage of its metal footprints in a global comparative context. Here, we show that from 1995 to 2019, China's metal footprints experienced a substantial increase with the primary driving force being per capita GDP. All the four metal categories (bulk metals, noble metals, critical metals, and low-carbon metals) witnessed a great demand structure change; the investment-related footprints became more prevalent than consumption-related footprints for all metal categories. In comparison to developed countries, China presently finds itself in the ascending phase of an inverted “N” curve, with none of the metal categories having reached their peaks.

AB  - The incorporation of straw with decomposing inoculants into soils has been widely recommended to sustain agricultural productivity. However, comprehensive analyses assessing the effects of straw combined with decomposing inoculants on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, net primary production (NPP), the net ecosystem carbon budget (NECB), and the carbon footprint (CF) in farmland ecosystems are scant. Here, we carried out a 2-year field study in a wheat cropping system with six treatments: rice straw (S), a straw-decomposing Bacillus subtilis inoculant (K), a straw-decomposing Aspergillus oryzae inoculant (Q), a combination of straw and Bacillus subtilis inoculant (SK), a combination of straw and Aspergillus oryzae inoculant (SQ), and a control with no rice straw or decomposing inoculant (Control). We found that all the treatments resulted in a positive NECB ranging between 838 and 5065 kg C ha−1. Relative to the Control, the S treatment increased CO2 emissions by 16%, while considerably enhancing the NECB by 349%. This difference might be attributed to the straw C input and an increase in plant productivity (NPP, 30%). More importantly, in comparison to that in S, the NECB in SK and SQ significantly increased by 27–35% due to the positive response of NPP to the decomposing inoculants. Although the combination of straw and decomposing inoculants yielded a 3% increase in indirect GHG emissions, it also exhibited the lowest CF (0.18 kg CO2-eq kg−1 of grain). This result was attributed to the synergistic effects of straw and decomposing inoculants, which reduced direct N2O emissions and increased wheat productivity. Overall, the findings of the present study suggested that the combined amendment of straw and decomposing inoculants is an environmentally sustainable management practice in wheat cropping systems that can generate win–win scenarios through improvements in soil C stock, crop productivity, and GHG mitigation.

AB  - Two main challenges which human society faces for sustainable development goals are the maintenance of food security and mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Here, we examined the impacts of six fertilization treatments including unfertilized control (CK), mineral nitrogen (N, 90 kg N ha−1), mineral N plus 30 kg P ha−1 phosphorus (NP), NP combined with 3.75 Mg ha−1 straw (NP + Str), farmyard manure (Man, 75 Mg ha−1), and NP combined with manure (NP + Man) on crop productivity and carbon emissions (soil GHG emission; GHGI, yield-based GHG intensity; NGHGB, net GHG balance; carbon footprint, CF) in a maize-wheat cropping system during two years (April 2018–June 2020) in a semi-arid continental climate after 40 years of fertilization in the Northwest China. Manure and straw increased total GHG by 38–60 % compared to the mineral fertilizers alone, which was mainly due to the 49–80 % higher direct emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) rather than nitrous oxide (N2O). Compared to the N fertilizer alone, organic amendments and NP increased cumulative energy yield by 134–202 % but decreased GHGI by 38–55 %, indicating that organic fertilizers increased crop productivity at the cost of higher GHG emissions. When the soil organic carbon changes (ΔSOC) were accounted for in the C emission balance, manure application acted as a net C sink due to the NGHGB recorded with −123 kg CO2-eq ha−1 year−1. When producing the same yield and economic benefits, the manure and straw addition decreased the CF by 59–85 % compared to N fertilization alone. Overall, the transition from mineral to organic fertilization in the semi-arid regions is a two-way independent solution to increase agricultural productivity along with the reduction of C emissions.

AB  - This study examines the effect of several site-specific factors on the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions stemming from operation of 4G and 5G technology-based telecommunication towers at many locations across India with focus on the assessment of the incremental change expected due to 5G technology adoption. Also, the impact of adopting solar photovoltaics (PV) based hybrid power systems on overall CO2 emissions from operation of telecom towers. Optimal designs of solar PV-based hybrid systems are obtained using HOMER software for 25 diverse Indian locations for powering both 4G and 5G telecom towers while considering site-specific factors such as solar resource availability, availability and tariff of grid electricity and the unit price of diesel used in the Diesel Generator (DG) of the hybrid system. From the results of the study it is noted that, with the current energy supply mix, a tripling of the carbon dioxide emissions is expected if all of India's 0.71 million telecom towers adopt 5G technology. Adoption of solar PV-based systems along with grid electricity and diesel generator in hybrid mode has the potential to reduces carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 55 % for the existing telecom towers in India. For the case of all telecom towers transitioning to 5G technology, about 58 % reduction in CO2 emissions is possible with the adoption of PV-based hybrid power systems. From the perspective of the unit cost of CO2 emissions mitigation, the adoption of solar PV-based hybrid systems is found to be a no regret option. Results of the study have significant policy implications towards designing appropriate strategies for reducing carbon footprint of telecom tower operation in India.

AB  - The phenomenon of global warming occurs when air pollutants such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and other GreenHouse Gases (GHGs) are collected into the atmosphere and absorb solar radiation which, according to the natural process, should normally escape into the space, trapping heat and thus causing the planet temperature to rise. One of the available tools of the international scientific community to measure the impact of human activity on the environment, is to record and quantify the carbon footprint, in other words, the total greenhouse gas emissions of a product (or service) throughout its life cycle. The present paper focuses on the above issues and presents the methodology and the outcome of a real case study, aiming to lead to useful conclusions. In this framework a study has been made in order to calculate and analyze the carbon footprint of a wine making company that is based in northern Greece. One of the most important conclusions of this work is the overwhelming share (54 %) that Scope 3 has to the total Carbon Footprint, compared to Scope 1 (25 %) and Scope 2 (21 %), as it is vividly shown in the above Graphical Abstract. While the operation of a wine making company is divided in two main steams, Vineyard and Winery, it is concluded, that the Emissions of the Vineyard participate by 32 % in the total Emissions, while the Emissions of the Winery by 68 % respectively. Significant point of the case study is the total Absorptions that had been calculated to cover almost the 52 % of the total Emissions.

AB  - The deployment of energy sources is considered the compassion of several United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Countries should keep balance with the three major proportions of the global energy trilemma: energy security, affordability, energy access, and ecological balance to construct a solid basis for competitiveness and prosperity. In this regard, this study examines the influence of nuclear energy, technological innovations, renewable energy, non-renewable energy, and natural resources on carbon footprint in the highest nuclear energy-producing countries from 1990 to 2019. To do this, we developed an inclusive and comprehensive empirical investigation and applied modern econometric approaches. Panel second-generation long-run cointegration advocates long-run associations among the series. The findings reveal that nuclear and renewable energy consumption extensively improve environmental excellence. Conversely, technological innovations and non-renewable energy significantly reduce environmental sustainability. Moreover, natural resources play an adverse role in long-run. The findings of the panel causality test discovered unidirectional causality is running from carbon footprint to nuclear energy. Additionally, bidirectional causality exists between technological innovations, renewables, non-renewables, and natural resources with carbon footprint. This recommends that these nations should integrate energy policy activities and develop energy strategy consistency by harmonizing the vital global nuclear energy aspects to assist a well-calibrated energy structure.

AB  - Since transportation accounts for a large portion of a city's overall greenhouse gas emissions, cities are looking to lessen this effect by replacing more internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) with electric vehicles (EVs). In this research, two vehicle models of comparable size from each category were compared using life cycle analysis (ICEV and EV). The ICEV is a Ford Transit van, while the EV is a Ford E-transit van, both of which are supposed to have a lifespan of 150,000 km for comparison. Carbon footprint for both vehicles is examined from cradle-to-grave: including raw material production, manufacturing, transportation, operation, and decommissioning. According to the findings, the carbon emissions produced per kilometer by an electric vehicle are considerably lower. The Ford transit van emits 469.1 gCO2-eq/km and the Ford E-transit van emits 363.2 gCO2eq/km during a vehicle's lifetime. The impact of electricity generating in each U.S. states on the carbon footprint of ICEVs and EVs showed that the use of renewable energy sources for power generation would result in a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. Lifespan sensitivity analysis with 100000 km and 350000 km indicated that the longer life of a vehicle alters the efficiency balance in favor of an electric vehicle.

AB  - The need for clear and straightforward guidelines for carbon footprint (CFP) and energy footprint (EFP) evaluations is critical due to the non-transparent and misleading results that have been reported. This study aims to address this gap by integrating CFP, EFP, toxicity, and economic assessments to evaluate the eco-environmental impacts of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The results indicate that the total CFP was below 0.6 kg CO2/kg COD removed, which is attributed to CO2 offset and biogas recovery. However, site-specific EFP varied considerably from 482.7 to 2294 kgCO2/kWh due to design differences of WWTPs and their aeration and mixing energy demand (46.96–66.1%). The use of crude oil and natural gas for electricity generation significantly increased EFP, CFP, and carcinogenic human toxicity. In contrast, a combined heat and power (CHP) installation enabled energy recovery ranging from 12.09% to 65.65%. Construction costs dominated the highest share of total costs (85.43%), with indirect construction costs (42.9%) and operation labor costs (61.4%) being the primary elements in the total net costs. It is worth noting that site-specific CO2 emission factors were used in the calculations to decrease model uncertainty. However, to improve modeling reliability, we recommend modifying the regional CO2 emission factor and focusing on emerging technologies to recover energy and biogas.

AB  - Cities are at the forefront of the battle against climate change. However, intercity comparisons and responsibility allocations among cities are hindered because cost- and time-effective methods to calculate the carbon footprints of global cities have yet to be developed. Here, we establish a hybrid method integrating top-down input–output analysis and bottom-up crowdsourced data to estimate the carbon footprints of global cities. Using city purchasing power as the main predictor of the carbon footprint, we estimate the carbon footprints of 465 global cities in 2020. Those cities comprise 10% of the global population but account for 18% of the global carbon emissions showing a significant concentration of carbon emissions. The Gini coefficients are applied to show that global carbon inequality is less than income inequality. In addition, the increased carbon emissions that come from high consumption lifestyles offset the carbon reduction by efficiency gains that could result from compact city design and large city scale. Large climate benefits could be obtained by achieving a low-carbon transition in a small number of global cities, emphasizing the need for leadership from globally important urban centres.

AB  - Quantifying the global warming potential of existing water infrastructure is an important step in realising the water industry's commitment to net-zero carbon. Whilst there has been an improved understanding of the global warming potential of centralized urban water infrastructure, rigorous analyses of smaller-scale rural systems are rare. This work adopts a life cycle assessment to ascertain the global warming potential of existing drinking water treatment works and wastewater treatment works associated with five Scottish islands: Arran, Iona, Jura, Barra, and Vatersay. The water systems, from source to sink, along with the use of chemicals, transportation, energy, and the reuse of waste products from water infrastructure are considered. The global warming potentials of the island's drinking water treatment works ranged from 0.18 to 0.79 kgCO2-eq/m3 of drinking water, while that for wastewater treatment works were 0.51 to 1.14 kgCO2-eq/m3 of wastewater. The global warming potential for water services on the islands can be as much as 7-times of that water services across Scotland as previously reported. Major global warming potential contributor in drinking water treatment works was the electricity consumed by the membrane bioreactors. The modelled direct emission of methane from sludge in septic tanks and for land reclamation made the largest contribution to global warming potential. It was also highly sensitive to model parameters, which highlights the need for a comprehensive exploration of process emissions from septic tanks and sludge handling. This analysis of existing rural water infrastructure is a baseline against which potential alternative low-carbon technology configurations can be compared.

AB  - Biomass cultivation has a large influence over the resulting bio-based products and is largely influenced by local conditions. Therefore, accounting for spatialization into sustainability assessments under the life-cycle perspective is key. The study aims to integrate satellite image classification for sugarcane areas in the Center-South of Brazil with georeferenced modeling for sugarcane yield and ethanol production. 290 ethanol mills were simulated, and the resulting inventories were used to trace ethanol's carbon footprint spatial profile and mitigation potential for gasoline substitution. Ethanol's carbon intensity varied from 14.38 to 34.0 gCO2e.MJ−1, with an average of 18.41 gCO2e.MJ−1. By translating these indicators into Decarbonization Credits (CBIOS), under the RenovaBio program, a GHG mitigation potential of 45.07 MtCO2e could be annually attributed to the current Brazilian ethanol sector, corresponding to an additional revenue of US$ 0.88 billion. The proposed georeferenced framework showed significant spatial variations that should be accounted in future sustainability assessments.

AB  - China is one of the largest manufacturers, consumers, and traders of wood-based panels (WBPs) globally. The Chinese manufacturing process for WBPs is significantly different from that used in other countries and the greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint assessment of this process has not yet received attention. And a comprehensive evaluation of the effect of different approaches to estimate the delayed emission of biogenic carbon on the GHG footprints of different WBP types is still missing. This study aims to quantify: i) the GHG footprint of WBPs produced in China, and ii) the influence of different methods to assess the delayed emission of biogenic carbon. Cradle-to-gate life cycle models are developed for plywood (PLY), fiberboard (FB), particleboard (PB) and oriented strand boards (OSB). Based on two common end-of-life (EoL) destinations (i.e., incineration and landfill), three approaches to the estimation of the delayed emissions of biogenic carbon in cradle-to-grave assessments are compared. The cradle-to-gate results show that the GHG footprints of PLY, FB, PB and OSB without considering biogenic carbon storage are 538 kg CO2 e/m³, 406 kg CO2 e/m³, 348 kg CO2 e/m³ and 552 kg CO2 e/m³, respectively. For the four types of WBPs, resources extraction stage provides the largest contribution to the GHG footprints (55%–81%), followed by the production process (18%–31%) and raw material transportation (1%–18%). The methodologies used to assess delayed emissions in cradle-to-grave WBP GHG footprint assessments play an important role, especially for incineration scenarios. Finally, emission reduction measures are proposed based on reducing the consumption of adhesives and of energy use in the production process.

AB  - The augmentation of collaborative governance, intertwining both emission mitigation and carbon sequestration enhancement, is pivotal for urban areas to manifest a leading role within the context of the “dual carbon” objectives. Notwithstanding, extant research exhibits an insufficiency in detail and a neglect of the intricate relationship and reciprocal dynamics between urban carbon emissions and ecological carbon sinks. In response to this gap, this study constructs and gauges the carbon footprint pressure (CFP) index of the Yangtze River Delta region over the period 2000–2020. Moreover, a comprehensive approach combining a modified gravity model, social network analysis, and the STIRPAT model is employed to systematically explore the evolution characteristics and effects of spatial correlations of CFP. The results show that the overall CFP predominantly displayed an oscillatory uptrend, underscored by stark spatial non-uniformity and an annually exacerbating divergence. The CFP exhibited a complex network structure, with continually intensifying stability and incremental convergence in its hierarchical framework. Nevertheless, the core-periphery attributes within this network remained pronounced, despite the low degree of network connectivity. Furthermore, the network incorporated four dynamically transmuting blocks. With the variable extent of the block's deconstruction and restructuring, the “club” spatial dispersion characteristic became increasingly evident. The degree centrality and betweenness centrality of urban nodes rendered an adverse impact on CFP, with the latter wielding a more potent effect.
